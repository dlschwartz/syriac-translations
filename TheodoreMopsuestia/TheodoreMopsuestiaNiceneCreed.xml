      <body>
         <p>By the power of our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ we begin to write the exposition of the faith of
            the three hundred and eighteen (Fathers)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> composed by <persName>Mar Theodore</persName> the interpreter.</p>
         <div type="chapter" n="1">
            <head>Chapter I</head>
            <p>What discourse is worthy of, and what mind is equal to, the greatness of the subjects
               placed before us? Or which is the tongue that is able to teach these mysteries? It is
               indeed difficult for our tongues to speak with accuracy even of the created natures,
               because they also are created with great wisdom by the Maker. As for those which are
               higher than our nature—because such are those of which we intend to speak—how much
               are they not higher than all the minds of men? They truly transcend our words! The
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName> bears witness concerning them in saying: <quote>Eye hath not seen nor ear
               heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared
               for them that love Him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/></p>
            <p>It is with these wonderful things that our discourse wishes to deal, and it is to the
               delight of these mysteries that we have been invited, because the time of the great
               festival of the holy Passover leads us to teach them. If God had wished those
               heavenly gifts not to be known to us, it is evident that we should not have been able
               to discourse on them, because how could a man have spoken of unknown things? Since,
               however, He wished from the first and before the foundations of the world to make
               manifest the wisdom that was in Him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> through the Economy of our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ,
               He revealed to us these hidden mysteries and the greatness of these gifts, and He
               granted their knowledge to men through the Holy Spirit. It is indeed written that God
               revealed to us by His Spirit and showed us the sublime and ineffable mysteries which
               are performed by the power of the Holy Spirit so that through them we might proceed
               in a congruous way, by degrees and by <pb n="19"/> faith, to these future gifts.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> This is the
               reason why we desired to discourse with confidence, according to the grace of God
               vouchsafed to us, on these unspeakable things which are higher than ourselves. It is
               this time of this festival that has led us to speak with those who wish [to
               participate in] these awe-inspiring mysteries.</p>
            <p>Now is the time for me to say: <quote>Sing unto the Lord a new song for He has done
               marvellous things.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> Indeed a new song is required for new things, as we are dealing
               with the New Testament which God established for the human race through the Economy
               of our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ, when He abolished all old things and showed new things in
               their place. Every man who is in Christ is a new creature; old things are passed away
               and all things are become new.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> Death and corruption have ceased, passions and
               mutability have passed away, and the life of the new creature has been made manifest,
               a life which we hope to reach after<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> our resurrection from the dead. At the
               resurrection from the dead He will make us new instead of old, and incorruptible and
               immortal instead of corruptible and mortal.</p>
            <p>He gave us this new covenant which is fit for those who are renewed; and because of
               this covenant we receive the knowledge of these mysteries so that we should put off
               the old man and put on the new man who is renewed after the image of Him who created
               him, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, but Christ is all and in
               all.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> This will take place in reality in the next world when we shall have become
               immortal and incorruptible, when we shall only contemplate Christ of whose Kingdom we
               shall partake, when the incident of being Jew or Greek, bond or free, shall be taken
               from us, and when all the ways of the image of this world shall have completely
               disappeared. Indeed what incidence of being Jew or Greek, bond or free, can remain
               with those who are in an immortal and incorruptible nature after the image of Christ,
               according to the testimony of the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>?</p>
            <p>Because it was necessary that the faith in the truth of the future gifts should
               remain in us so that we should not throw doubts on them on account of their
               greatness—since we see them very much alien to our nature and above it—these
               awe-inspiring mysteries were confided <pb n="20"/> to us in order that through them as through
               symbols we might gradually approach our future hope, and in order to obtain a faith
               without doubts in these gifts, while cultivating a conduct that is in harmony with
               the new world and arranging our work in this world as much as possible in conformity
               with the following sentences: <quote>Our conversation is in heaven,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> and: <quote>our building
               is of God,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> and <quote>we have a house in heaven not made with hands.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/></p>
            <p>While still on the earth we have been inscribed<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> in that awe-inspiring glory of the
               future world through these mysteries, but we (ought to) live as much as possible a
               heavenly life in spurning visible things and aspiring after future things. Those who
               are about to partake now of these awe-inspiring mysteries are inspired to do so by
               the grace of God. They do not do this in order to partake of small and ordinary
               gifts, but to be transformed completely into new men and to possess different virtues
               which they will receive by the gift of the grace of God: being mortal they will
               become immortal, being corruptible they will become incorruptible, being passible
               they will become impassible, being changeable they will become unchangeable, being
               bond they will become free, being enemies they will become friends, being strangers
               they will become sons. They will no more be considered a part of <persName>Adam</persName> but of Christ;
               they will call as their head not <persName>Adam</persName> but Christ, who has renewed them; they will not
               cultivate a ground that will bring forth thorns and thistles to them,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> but they will
               dwell in a heaven which is remote and immune from all sorrow and sighing;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> nor will
               death rule over them but they will become themselves rulers in a new life where they
               will be not slaves of sin but warriors of righteousness, not servants of <persName>Satan</persName> but
               intimate friends of Christ for all time.</p>
            <p><persName>Adam</persName>, the father of mankind, received the abode of Paradise from which he was driven
               out through his disobedience and sin, and we, who became the heirs of his nature and
               his punishment, ascend to heaven by faith in Christ through our participation in
               these mysteries, as He said: <quote>Except a man he born of water and of the Spirit he
               cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> The man, however, who receives this
               spiritual birth is immediately inscribed in heaven and <pb n="21"/> becomes the heir and
               partaker of those future gifts, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> because those who
               believed in Christ are in expectation of making their abode in heaven after the
               resurrection from the dead. Indeed we hope to go to heaven where the first man,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/>
               Christ, went on our behalf. Through these mysteries we are truly inscribed in that
               abode.</p>
            <p>We are in need of great care and immense diligence in order not to fall away from
               this great promise and suffer the fate of <persName>Adam</persName> who was driven out of Paradise. This
               is the reason why we partake in a wonderful way of these awe-inspiring mysteries with
               a true faith which has no doubt,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> and we ought not to forget this faith but to keep
               what we have received with great care. When we have received these heavenly gifts in
               a perfect manner so that we may delight in them, and when we have become their heirs
               in our actions, it is impossible that we should fall away from them. As long as we
               are on the earth, however, because we only receive them by hope through our
               participation in these mysteries, it is possible to fall away from them, as we have a
               changeable nature. We ought, therefore, to have great care and anxiety concerning
               them and to endeavour truly to possess the hope of the future in our souls.</p>
            <p>Now which is the faith and which are the promises through which we have our part in
               mysteries in the hope of these heavenly gifts in which we will delight? These are
               found in the profession of faith which we make before Christ our Lord at the time of
               our baptism. If it were possible to comprehend their power by hearing only, our words
               would have been useless, because their mere recitation would have made them
               understood by those who heard them. Since, however, there is much power hidden in
               them—as our holy Fathers confided to us from the gift of God an ineffable treasure
               condensed in words which are easy to learn and to remember—it is necessary to teach
               those who are about to receive these mysteries and to show them the sense and the
               meaning that are hidden in them. When they have learnt the greatness of the gift to
               which they wish to make their approach, and have understood the meaning of their
               religion and their promises for the sake of which they receive such a great gift,
               they will keep with diligence in their souls the faith which has been handed down to
               them. <pb n="22"/> </p>
            <p>The principle of your faith and promise which is to be carefully kept in these
               mysteries is: I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Creator of all things visible
               and invisible. By the grace of our Lord we will explain these words one after
               another, because it is good that you should know the power of all of them. Let us,
               therefore, rightly begin from where you also began in your profession of faith:</p>
            <p>I believe in one God, Father Almighty. This is the foundation of the religion of the
               fear of God,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> "for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the
               mouth confession is made unto salvation."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> This is the truth of the true teaching of
               the faith. Because the question of religion lies in the belief in things that are
               invisible and indescribable, it is in need of faith, which causes mind to see a thing
               that is invisible. The things that are visible we see them with our eyes, while the
               things that are invisible are only seen by faith, as <quote>faith is the substance of
               things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/></p>
            <p>This faith brings in substance to the mind the things that are not yet existent in
               reality. We accept by faith as true the resurrection from the dead to heaven and all
               the future existence, which is not yet in existence. Faith causes the soul to see and
               understand the things that are invisible and indescribable. We are enabled by faith
               to be worthy of seeing the nature of God <quote>who is the sole invisible and
               incorruptible, who dwelleth in the bright light which has no equal, and whom no man
               hath seen nor can see.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/></p>
            <p>We are able to see the visible thing with material eyes, if these are sound and able
               to see, and if there is nothing to hinder them from seeing properly; but if they are
               affected by injury, all things that were visible become invisible, although in
               reality visible. In this same way we all see with accuracy the invisible and the
               indescribable things, which the question of religion has taught us, if our faith is
               sound, but they are not seen by those whose faith is not sound. The question of
               religion consists in two things: confession concerning God and concerning all the
               various and numerous things that were and will be made by Him, and both of these are
               in need of faith as is shown by the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>: <quote>He that cometh to the religion of
               God must believe that He is</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> and that the "worlds were framed by His <pb n="23"/> Word so
               that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/></p>
            <p>In these he shows first that even confession concerning God cannot consist in
               anything but the thought of religion<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> through faith alone; secondly, that we are
               unable to understand and confess the things that were made by Him if we do not
               receive their knowledge by faith. Faith perfects those who accept it thoroughly in
               the truth of religion while those who become remote from it sink in error
               completely.</p>
            <p><persName>Paul</persName> called the Church of God <quote>the pillar and ground of the truth,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> because it is
               sound in faith and well established in the teaching of religion. As to those who are
               outside the faith: pagans, Jews, and heretics, because they are devoid of faith, they
               greatly stray from the truth. Indeed because the pagans had no faith they were unable
               to understand how God was able to create and to make everything from nothing and
               establish it in substance, and in their error they gave fancifully to God a consort
               to whom He had given a seat with Him from eternity; and they strayed from the truth
               into various other insipid stories. As to Jews they recoiled from the name of a son,
               and because of their lack of faith they did not understand the one who is a true
               Son.</p>
            <p>In this way all the heretics who are outside the Church and who have ascribed the
               name of Christ with untruth to themselves, because they have no faith, have erred and
               strayed from the truth. In order not to mention to your hearing all the heresies, it
               will be sufficient to refer to <persName>Arius</persName> and <persName>Eunomius</persName> and all those who subscribe to
               their opinion, and note how they were affected with the disease of the Jews; and
               because of their lack of faith they did not understand nor did they accept that the
               Son is of Divine nature, and that everything that is said of the nature of the Father
               is said also of that of the Son, while the nature of the Father in no way suffers
               from the fact that it has a true Son who in His nature is a true mirror of
               itself.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/></p>
            <p>These few things have been said out of many in order to rebuke <pb n="24"/> those who have
               strayed from the truth, and to show that they have strayed because of their lack of
               faith. Indeed, the error of men who have gone astray because of their lack of faith
               is great and possesses many ramifications, and as error increases in proportion to
               its remoteness from faith, so also knowledge increases in proportion to its nearness
               to faith. It is by faith that we know that God is, that He is the creator of
               everything and that He created everything from nothing. It is by it that we
               understand that those who have passed away and perished will come back again to life
               and existence, when the Creator wishes. It is by faith that we have known that the
               Father has a Son born of His nature and God like Himself. It is by faith that we have
               accepted that the Holy Spirit is of the same nature as God the Father and that He is
               always with the Father and the Son. It is by faith that we have no doubt nor
               suspicion concerning the preaching of the Economy of Christ which took place in the
               world.</p>
            <p>It is, therefore, with justice that our blessed Fathers placed faith like a
               foundation in the forefront of our teaching and of the mystery of our covenant, and
               it is with right that they intimated to us to begin from there and say: I believe in
               one God, Father Almighty. We must not be astonished that our blessed Fathers included
               and handed down to us all the teaching of religion in a few words. They thought that
               a long discourse would better fit other times and other persons. As to you who for a
               long time have been weaned from the world, and have come nigh unto religion with a
               good will, and have made yourselves ready to receive the Divine mysteries with a
               clean conscience at a time full of fear, condensed words are more useful, as their
               fewness renders them more easy to keep in your memory when you wish to remember the
               faith which you professed and the promises which you made on account of these
               mysteries It is right, however, that a detailed teaching of them should be added to
               you so that you should understand them more accurately, and beware in your souls of
               all the words of the enemies of religion when you stand fast by this Divine teaching
               which is confided to you. I believe in one God, Father Almighty. See how our blessed
               Fathers, with the first word of the true profession of faith in one God the Father,
               removed us with care from the error of polytheism and from the fallacy of Judaism
               which puts in practice to-day all the teaching of the Old Testament in its entirety. <pb n="25"/> </p>
            <p>The words of the New Testament concerning Christ were found in the prophets of the
               Old Testament; they were indeed found in the prophets as a symbol and a sign whereby
               the Jews expected Christ to appear to them as a man, but none of them was aware of
               the divinity of the Only Begotten Son—the Word-God. (Our blessed Fathers) gave us a
               perfect doctrine which separates from paganism those who become initiated to
               religion, and which removes completely from the error of polytheism those who obey
               its commandments, while teaching that the natures of the Godhead are not many and
               separate, but that God is in one, single and eternal nature which is the cause of
               everything; that such a one is God, and outside Him there is no other God; that God
               is a being who is eternal and the cause of everything; that a being who is not like
               this is not God by nature; that a being who is eternal is the cause of everything;
               that a being who is not eternal and the cause of everything, is not God but the work
               of God, who alone is capable of creating everything from nothing.</p>
            <p>He said: <quote>The Lord Thy God is one Lord</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> in order that we might learn that there is
               one nature in the Godhead to which is due the name of Lord and God. He also said:
               <quote>the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth
               and from under the heavens</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> in order that we might understand that he who is not
               the cause of everything is not God. The one who is the cause of everything is God
               alone. He said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>I am the cause of everything,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/> in order that we might
               learn that He is truly the one who was from eternity and is always, and that He is
               God. He who does not possess this attribute and is not eternal, is not truly existent
               by Himself, but is made and has actually been made when he was not existent, at the
               time at which the one who is from eternity, that is to say God, wished to make
               him.</p>
            <p>He also said: <quote>I am the first and the last God and there was no other god before me
               and there shall be no other god after me,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> in order that we might understand that
               He is the God who was first and from eternity and that it is impossible that another
               God that is created should exist. Divine nature cannot indeed fall within the notion
               of creation.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/></p>
            <pb n="26"/>
            <p>All these words teach us the doctrine of religion and expel the error of paganism.
               Among pagans gods are many and of different kinds: some of them are young, and some
               others old; some of them can do this, and some others that; some of them perish, and
               some others will continue their existence; and they are of different natures. That we
               ought to reject all these the Old Testament taught us in the prophets, who spoke
               through the Holy Spirit to the effect that all the gods of the Gentiles are false and
               are not gods because God is one, who is from eternity and is the cause of everything,
               as He said: <quote>There shall be no strange god in thee,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> that is to say a new god,
               and, <quote>neither shalt thou worship a strange god</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/> because everything that is new is
               not God, and <quote>they are new gods that came newly up.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/></p>
            <p>Divine nature is one and eternal. It was in no need to be made by another, because it
               is the cause of everything. This is the reason why He is God alone, and anything that
               is made cannot by nature be God, as it is made by another. All the created things
               rightly attribute their existence to their Creator who is God, to whom they owe their
               being, and for this they are under an obligation of gratitude to Him who by His own
               good will and power vouchsafed to them to be what they are.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers succinctly included all this great teaching in the sentence: I
               believe in one God. Let us, therefore, accept the belief in one God according to the
               preaching of the prophets and the teaching of our Fathers. Divine nature is truly
               one, and it exists from eternity and is the cause of everything; this is not as the
               pagans erroneously state that there are many gods of different kinds.</p>
            <p>It is necessary that we should offer you an oral teaching about everything, little by
               little, in order that you may be able to remember the things that are spoken to you,
               as these are indispensable to those who adhere to what has preceded. By the help of
               the grace of God we will keep our promise to you in other days, and now let the words
               that have been spoken suffice, and let us glorify the Father, the Son and the Holy
               Spirit, now, always and for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Here ends the first chapter. <pb n="27"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="2">
            <head>Chapter II</head>
            <head>On Faith</head>
            <p>Yesterday we spoke to your love sufficiently, and in the measure granted to us by the
               grace of God, of faith which is the foundation of the principle of religion. We
               approached the words of our profession of faith and showed how through faith in one
               God all the error of the polytheism of the Gentiles vanishes completely. We learned
               from the holy Books of the prophets to shake off from us all the aberrations of
               pagans, whose gods are different and numerous, and to believe that Divine nature
               which ought to be called God and Lord is one, because He alone is from eternity and
               is the cause of everything.</p>
            <p>All the created beings are very remote from this nature, as it is impossible to admit
               that a created being is from eternity, and the created beings themselves will not
               suffer to be called rightfully Lord and God by nature. A being who is created by
               another cannot by any means create another being from nothing, or be called God with
               justice, but the one who created him is God by necessity. This is the reason why we
               say that there is only one God as the blessed prophets taught us; and by the grace of
               the Holy Spirit they spoke and defined the kind of nature which belongs to God.
               Beyond this they did not teach us anything clearly.</p>
            <p>The doctrine concerning the Father and the Son was kept (to be promulgated) by Christ
               our Lord, who taught His disciples that which was unknown before and was not revealed
               to men, and ordered them to teach it to others also in saying to them plainly: <quote>Go ye
               and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
               of the Holy Ghost.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n36"/> As the blessed Moses said when he promulgated his doctrine:
               <quote>The Lord, Thy God is one Lord</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/>—a doctrine that was taught and handed down by all
               the prophets—so the Christ our Lord gave His teaching in the name of the Father, of
               the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, but did not say what we had to learn and to teach
               others concerning the Lord and God, as this had been clearly done by the prophets. He
               ordered His disciples to teach all the nations that which was lacking to make the
               teaching of the prophets perfect, and for this He said: <quote>Go ye and teach all nations <pb n="28"/> 
               baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</quote>
               not that we should think that one of these is not God nor that there is a God beside
               them, but that we should believe that they alone constitute Divine nature, which we
               had formerly learnt from the prophets to be one.</p>
            <p>Because the Gentiles had previously taught the doctrine of the plurality of gods, who
               were numerous and different in youth and old age, in weakness and strength, so that
               some of them were able to do this and some others that—Christ ordered His disciples
               against this to teach all the nations to turn from all the error of paganism, and to
               believe in the unity of nature in the Godhead, as was the case with the doctrine
               first taught to mankind, from which the knowledge of religion was received; and also
               to learn that the one who is from eternity and is the cause of everything is one
               Divine nature known in the three persons of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy
               Spirit.</p>
            <p>He would not have induced the Gentiles to turn away from names of false gods to the
               knowledge of the Father if He did not know that He (the Father) was truly Divine
               nature, nor would He have brought them to the knowledge of the Son if He did not know
               that He (the Son) was truly of the same Divine nature, nor would He have inculcated
               to them the knowledge of the Holy Spirit if He knew that He (the Holy Spirit) was
               alien to that nature, otherwise He would have caused them to turn from one falsehood
               to the knowledge of another falsehood. It is known that it is from false gods, who
               were wrongly called gods, that He ordered His disciples in His teaching to turn the
               Gentiles to the knowledge of the true God, which consists in the faith in the Father,
               the Son and the Holy Spirit. Each one of these persons is a true God, but the Divine
               nature of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit which we believe to be
               eternal and the cause of everything, is one.</p>
            <p>In this way the teaching of the Old Testament is in harmony with the teaching of the
               New Testament, and the words which the prophets uttered concerning God are not
               foreign nor contradictory to those which Christ our Lord delivered to the Gentiles
               through the Apostles, as His words are in full harmony with the true knowledge of
               religion according to the teaching of the prophets. Through the prophets we only
               understood God and the being to whom an uncreated nature belongs, but the teaching of
               our Lord Jesus Christ gave us also with <pb n="29"/> certainty the persons in whom is Divine
               nature. This is the reason why our blessed Fathers placed first the doctrine of the
               belief in one God as it was written in the Old Testament in order to destroy the
               error of polytheism, and then imparted to us the knowledge of the persons according
               to the teaching of Christ. They were in a position—and it was easy for them—to repeat
               the words of our Lord <quote>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
               Ghost,</quote> but because they wrote this profession of faith against the teaching of the
               heretics, they taught it as succinctly as possible with more words than those uttered
               by our Lord, for the demolition of error and the construction of the doctrine of the
               Church, so that by their meaning they should reprove those who contradict the true
               faith. For this reason they added with justice the name of the Father after they had
               said, I believe in one God.</p>
            <p>After the words concerning God they proceeded to the teaching of the persons, which
               is the true teaching of the Christian faith and the true knowledge for those who
               become disciples of Christ. Because the sentence denotes Divine nature, it refers to
               the three persons, but as the teaching concerning the persons could not be considered
               as referring to one of them only, they rightly spoke to us of what is due to each
               person separately. At the beginning of their sentence they placed the Father from
               whom are the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Father is truly the one who is a Father
               alone, but we hold each one of the three persons to be God, because Christ included
               this true doctrine in His teaching concerning these three persons.</p>
            <p>When we hear the name <quote>Father</quote> we do not hear it to no purpose, but we understand
               that God is a Father, and a true Father, because He is Father alone; and we hold that
               God is Father in a way that belongs only to Divine nature. All the created beings
               obtain the power of being fathers after their creation, and there is no human being
               that has the attribute of fatherhood concomitantly with his existence. Even <persName>Adam</persName>, the
               first man, who was not born of another man, had not the attribute of fatherhood
               concomitantly with his existence. He came first into existence by the will of God the
               Creator and afterwards received the power of becoming a father, as it is said:<quote> <persName>Adam</persName>
               knew his wife, and she conceived and bore a son.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n38"/> He became and was called a
               father after his intercourse with <persName>Eve</persName>, after a long time of gestation, after pangs of
               travail, and after the birth of his child. It is iniquitous <pb n="30"/> to attribute any of
               those functions to Divine nature. He who had no need of time to exist was in no need
               of time to become a Father. Because He was from eternity, He was also a Father from
               eternity.</p>
            <p>God the Father is truly a father; and He did not receive this in time, because He did
               not have a Son after a time, but the latter was with Him from eternity and was from
               Him as a Son also from eternity. It is for this that when our Lord gave this
               wonderful teaching to His disciples He said, <quote>Teach in the name of the Father,</quote> and
               did not need to add another sentence in order to show whom He was calling <quote>Father.</quote>
               It was sufficient for Him to say, <quote>Teach and baptize</quote> to show whom He was calling
               Father. He called God the Father in whom they had to believe and in whose name they
               had to be baptized, the God who was from eternity according to the teaching of the
               prophets.</p>
            <p>It is not possible that the one who is from eternity should become Father after a
               time. The very name Father shows this without further addition. If like us He became
               Father later, He would also be identical with us in attribute and in the meaning of
               the word. Now since this vocable <quote>father</quote> is one and the same with many men, we
               should rightly inquire as to whom He called Father. Because He is a true Father, He
               is Father alone. As He is eternal by nature so He is eternally a Father. Since He is
               alone called by this name and in the full meaning of the word,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39"/> we do not feel any
               necessity to inquire who is the one who is called Father, as His very name indicates
               to us the true Father. When He says:<quote> I am that I am, this is my name for ever and
                  this is my memorial unto generations,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40"/> we understand that God is called by this
               name, because He is truly <quote>I am that I am</quote> while all the created beings are not truly
               <quote>I am that I am,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41"/> because they were created from nothing according to the will of
               their Maker. Because He is the true being, He is called I am that I am, and He is not
               made by another.</p>
            <p>As He is not like us He is not a Father like us, because He did not receive the power
               of becoming a Father in time. So when we hear the word "father" we should rightly
               think of that true Father who did not acquire the power of becoming a Father in time,
               nor was He in need of an intercourse. He is a Father in truth and from <pb n="31"/> eternity,
               a complete nature, with whom His child exists also from eternity.</p>
            <p>The sentence: I believe in one God the Father taught us all these things. It is
               rightly followed by the phrase Creator of all things visible and invisible, so that
               we should understand that He is not only the Father of the Son but also the Creator
               of all the creatures, and think of the difference which exists between Father and
               Creator, and between Son and creatures. He is the Father of the Son and the Creator
               of the creatures. The creatures were created later while the Son was from the
               beginning with Him and from Him. This is the difference between Father and Creator.
               He is called the Father of the one who was born of Him, and the Creator of all the
               natures which are outside Him and which were created from nothing by His will. This
               is the reason why they added nothing to the doctrine concerning the Father; indeed
               the very word Father sufficed to indicate the Son, as there is no father without a
               son, and as wherever there is a father there is also a son. As to the Son they were
               going to teach us as much as possible concerning Him later.</p>
            <p>Because He is Creator they added, Of all things visible and invisible in order to
               show in this also the difference between the Son and the creatures: that He is the
               Father of the Son only, while He is the Creator of everything visible and invisible,
               as everything was created from nothing. He would not have been called Father of the
               Son and Creator of the creatures if there was not a great difference between the two:
               the difference that should exist between a Son and creatures. He is called and He is
               the Father of the Son, because He is of the same nature as the one who is said to be
               His Son, but He is the Creator of everything because everything was created from
               nothing; and although the natures of the visible and invisible things differ among
               themselves yet all these created things, whether visible or invisible, came into
               existence by the will of their Maker. The fact that they were made from nothing is
               common to all of them, as all were created from nothing by the will of their
               Maker.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why the blessed <persName>David</persName> said: <quote>Praise ye the Lord from the heavens.
               Praise ye Him all His angels. Praise ye Him all His hosts. Praise ye Him sun and
               moon.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42"/> And he gradually enumerated all other 
               creatures found in the heavens and on <pb n="32"/> the earth, visible 
               and invisible, mortal and immortal, rational and irrational,
               material and immaterial, those with life and those without life. When he invited them
               to the praise of God he gave one reason which holds good for all of them: <quote>For He
               commanded, and they were created. He hath established them for ever and ever. He hath
               made a decree which shall not pass.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43"/> Because everything was created by Him and is
               sustained by His will, everything whether visible or not owes praise to the
               Creator.</p>
            <p>Two things render it obligatory for us to praise God: because He is God and because
               He is Creator. We must, however, understand the difference between the two. It is not
               because He is Father that He is also Creator, and it is not because He is Creator
               that He is also Father. Indeed He is not the Creator of the One whose Father He is,
               nor is He the Father of those whose Creator He is. He is only the Father of the true
               and only Son who is in His Father's bosom, because He was born of Him and is with Him
               from eternity, but He is the Creator of all the things which are created and made,
               which are very remote from His essence and which were created by His will when He
               pleased. He is called and He is the Father of the Son because the latter is from Him
               and consubstantial with Him, and He is the Maker and the Creator of the creatures
               because He brought them to existence from nothing.</p>
            <p>If He is called Father of men, He is not called their Father because He created them,
               but because of their proximity to Him and relation with Him. This is the reason why
               He is not called Father of all men but only of those who have relation with Him, such
               as <quote>I have nourished and brought up children.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44"/> To these He granted by special
               favour to be called in this way. As such also is the sentence: <quote><placeName>Israel</placeName> is my son,
               even my first-born,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n45"/> because the others were not sons.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n46"/></p>
            <p>Since we know the difference in our calling God: the Father of the Only Begotten Son
               who alone is the true Son because consubstantial with Him, and the Creator of
               everything which was created and came into <pb n="33"/> being from nothing—we should retain
               this meaning in our faith. When, therefore, we say <quote>Father,</quote> <quote>Maker</quote> we ought not to
               conceive of God that which we conceive of men when we call them fathers and makers,
               but we ought to understand the difference between Father and Maker from the way they
               may be applied to us. Indeed, as with God so with us, a father is one thing and a
               maker another thing. We are called the fathers of those who are from us and are born
               of our nature, but the makers of those things which are not of our nature but which
               were made and came into existence outside us. A house, a ship and similar things are
               not of our nature, and are made by us.</p>
            <p>Such being the case with us, we ought to think with a clear mind of the differences
               in God between the two terms of Father and Creator, and to understand that He is the
               Father of the Only Begotten Son who was born of His nature, and the Creator of all
               the creatures, which were created and came into existence from nothing. For this He
               did not need any matter but He created the natures through which they are seen and
               exist.</p>
            <p>Since we were created in the image of God,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n47"/> we picture to ourselves the higher
               things that are said of God through an image taken from things that belong to us. In
               this way it is possible also to picture to ourselves what and how great is the
               difference in the belief in God as Father and as Creator from things belonging to us,
               although it is clear that there is a great difference between us and God; and this
               difference we ought not to overlook when thinking of Divine nature and the works 
               done<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48"/> by it. Indeed when we speak of Divine nature we must remove completely from our
               mind all things that happen to us through weakness. When we do a work we are in need
               of labour, matter and time; but God is above all these, because the moment He wished
               it, His works were completed out of nothing. From the fact also that we are born in
               labour and through human agency,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n49"/> when we become fathers we need the nature of a
               female as matter, and a long period of time. Without these we cannot become fathers.
               As to God He is a Father without all these, because He did not experience labour nor
               did He make use of any material agency<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n49"/> nor did He need <pb n="34"/> intercourse, nor did He
               wait for any lapse of time, but He was at once Father from eternity.</p>
            <p>We should, therefore, rightly remove from God all unbecoming thoughts of things which
               happen to us through weakness whether in the domain of offspring or of work. We do
               everything in labour, and our nature itself emanates and suffers from it. As to God,
               He is above all these. Even when we reign, when we become governors, when we judge,
               when we work, when we speak, when we look, and do any other thing, we do all with
               labour; and when fatigue is protracted, it is followed by sweat; and because our
               nature is mortal and corruptible, it will perish through labour. As to God He does
               all things ascribed to Him, such as governing, providing, judging, reigning and the
               like without fatigue, without material agency and without injury.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n50"/></p>
            <p>It is such an idea that we must have of God, and it is such a faith that we ought to
               possess concerning God the Father. When we call Him Father, we mean<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n51"/> Father of the
               Son; and He is truly a Father by nature, as we are. It is impossible to understand
               how He is truly a Father if He were not a Father by nature. He is eternally a Father
               because His nature, in which He is a Father, is eternal. When we call Him Creator we
               mean that He created everything in wisdom as it is said: <quote>In wisdom Thou hast made
               them all,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n52"/> as we also do things in the wisdom of the skill that we possess. God is
               creator in the sense that when He wished, the creatures came fully into existence,
               and He was in no need of time or any other intervening thing between His wish and the
               coming into existence of His creatures. Immediately after He wishes to create a
               thing, it comes into existence from nothing.</p>
            <p>It is in this kind of profession of faith and with this meaning that our blessed
               Fathers gave us the belief in one God, Father and Creator, whom we have tried to
               explain to your love in a long teaching, which you should keep without modification,
               so that you should flee from the iniquitous opinions of the heretics, while your
               faith is sound, by the grace of our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ to whom, in conjunction with
               His Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory and honour for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the second chapter. <pb n="35"/> </p>

         <div type="chapter" n="3">
            <head>Chapter III</head>
            <head>On Faith</head>
            <p>I believe that from what has been said you have learnt sufficiently which are the
               things that those whose solicitude is the fear of God have to understand and utter
               concerning God the Father. Let us now quote and examine also the words uttered by our
               blessed Fathers in the profession of faith concerning the Son: And in one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>
               Christ the Only Begotten Son of God, the first-born of all the creatures.</p>
            <p>It was right that after their doctrine concerning the Father they should teach
               concerning the Son according to the teaching of our Lord, while preserving the order
               and the sequence of their words. As when speaking of the Father they not only said
               "Father" according to the teaching of our Lord, but added, in one God the Father and
               the Creator of all things, and first placed the name of God in the profession of
               faith by saying that He is one in order to refute the error of polytheism, and then
               added, the Father and the Creator of all things—so also they acted concerning the
               Son: In one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ the Only Begotten Son of God, the first-born of all the
               creatures. In this they clearly followed the preaching of the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>, who when
               teaching against idols and erroneous creeds said in refutation of the error of
               polytheism: <quote>There is but one God,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n53"/> and because he knew that we hold the doctrine
               of the faith in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, he strove openly to show us
               that the question of the faith in these persons does not inflict any injury on us in
               our faith<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n54"/> nor does it lead us to the error of polytheism.</p>
            <p>Because we know that the Divine nature of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy
               Spirit is one, when he desired to teach us this faith in a succinct manner he said:
               <quote>To us there is but one god,the Father, of whom are all things.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55"/> In saying "one
               God the Father" he confuted all the error of polytheism, and showed that to us one
               Divine nature is preached. By the addition of the person of the Father he showed us
               the Son also, as after this he said: <quote>And one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ by whom are all
               things</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56"/> in order to proclaim the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit together,
               while including also in his sentence <pb n="36"/> the Incarnation of our Lord which took place
               for our salvation and in which Divine nature became our Saviour. When he says: <quote>one
               Lord by whom are all things</quote> he alludes to God the Word who is a true Son
               consubstantial with His Father. He called Him rightly Lord in order to make us
               understand that He is from the Divine nature of God the Father.</p>
            <p>We do not say that the Father is one God in the sense that the Son is not God, nor
               that the Son is one Lord in the sense that the Father is not Lord, because it is
               known and evident that any one who is truly God is also truly Lord, and any one who
               is truly Lord is also truly God, and any one who is not truly God is not truly Lord:
               <quote>The Lord thy God is one Lord,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n57"/> as He alone is so in truth. He who possesses these
               true attributes is alone called Lord and God in truth, and there is no other thing
               outside this nature which may be called Lord and God in truth. He who says <quote>one God</quote>
               shows also that there is one Lord, and he who says <quote>there is but one Lord</quote> confesses
               also that there is but one God. He (<persName>Paul</persName>) first said: <quote>There is but one God</quote> and
               immediately after <quote>there is but one Lord, </quote>in order to separate the persons, because
               in repeating the word "one" about each one of them he showed that the two persons are
               to be known as of one Divine nature, which is truly both Lord and God.</p>
            <p>In order to include in their sentence the human nature which was assumed for our
               salvation they said: In one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ. This name is that of the man whom God
               put on, as the angel said: <quote>She shall bring forth a Son whose name shall be called
               '<persName>Jesus</persName>.'</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n58"/> They added also the word Christ in order to allude to the Holy Spirit,
               as it is written:<quote> <persName>Jesus</persName> of <placeName>Nazareth</placeName> whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost and with
               power.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n59"/> And He is God because of the close union with that Divine nature which is
               truly God.</p>
            <p>In this same way our blessed Fathers who assembled in that wonderful Council of the
               Catholic Church [of <placeName>Nicea</placeName>] first spoke, like <persName>Paul</persName>, of Divine nature while coupling
               with it a word which denotes the form of humanity which He took upon Him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n60"/> and said:
               And in one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ the Only Begotten Son of God, the first-born of all
               creatures. It is thus that they wished to teach mankind when they spoke of the Divine
               nature of the Son. His humanity, in which <pb n="37"/> is Divine nature, is also made known
               and proclaimed in it, according to the saying of the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>: "God was manifest
               in the flesh,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n61"/> and according to the saying of <persName>John</persName> the evangelist, <quote>The Word was
               made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only
               begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n62"/></p>
            <p>Our Fathers rightly thought not to overlook the humanity of our Lord which possesses
               such an ineffable union with Divine nature, but added: And in one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ,
               as if they had said, 'We believe in one Lord who is of Divine nature, to which the
               name of Lord and God is truly due.' In speaking of God the Word they said: By whom
               are all things,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n63"/> as the evangelist said: <quote>All things were made by Him, and nothing
               was made without Him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n64"/> It is as if they had said, ' This one we understand to be
               one Lord who is of the Divine nature of God the Father, who for our salvation put on
               a man in whom He dwelt and through whom He appeared and became known to mankind. It
               is this man who was said by the angel that he would be called <persName>Jesus</persName>, who was anointed
               with the Holy Ghost in whom He was perfected and justified, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>
               testifies.'<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n65"/> After saying these and showing the Divine nature and the human nature
               which God put on, they added: The <quote>Only Begotten Son,</quote> the <quote>first-born</quote> of all
               creatures. With these two words they alluded to the two natures, and by the
               difference between the words they made us understand the difference between the
               natures. From the fact also that they referred both words to the one person<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n66"/> of the
               Son they showed us the close union between the two natures. They did not make use of
               these words out of their own head but they took them from the teaching of Holy Writ.
               The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>Of whom Christ in the flesh, who is God over all,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n67"/> not
               that He is God by nature from the fact that He is of the House of <persName>David</persName> in the flesh,
               but he said <quote>in the flesh</quote> in order to indicate the human nature that was assumed. He
               said <quote>God over all</quote>in order to indicate the Divine nature which is higher than all,
               and which is the Lord. He used both words of one person in order to teach the close
               union of the two natures, and in order to make manifest the majesty and the honour
               that came to the man who was assumed by God who put Him on. <pb n="38"/> </p>
            <p>In this same way they said also: The Only Begotten Son, the first-born of all
               creatures. Because they were on the point of enlightening us concerning the two
               natures: how they are, which was the Divine nature which came down, and which was the
               human nature which was assumed—they used in advance these two expressions together in
               order to indicate the two natures through them. It is clear that they do not speak of
               one nature when they say: The Only Begotten Son, the first-born of all creatures,
               because the two expressions cannot be said of one nature, as there is a great
               difference between an only son and a first-born. It is not possible that an only son
               and a first-born should denote the same man. A first-born is the one who has many
               brothers while an only son is the one who has no brothers. So great is the difference
               between an only son and a firstborn that it may be compared with the difference that
               nature places between the one who is alone and the one who is in company of
               others.</p>
            <p>We call an only son one who has no other brothers at all while we call a first-born
               one who clearly has other brothers. This the Sacred Book teaches us also without
               ambiguity. In wishing to speak of an only son it says: "We beheld His glory, the
               glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n68"/> It says
               also: "The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n69"/> so that by His
               close proximity to His Father He might be known as an only Son. The sentence, "We
               beheld His glory, the glory as of an only begotten of the Father" shows that He alone
               is of the nature of the Father by birth, and He alone is a Son. In using the word
               "bosom" it conveys to us a union that never ceases, as it is unbecoming to understand
               this word to refer to a corporeal bosom of God. Inasmuch as they call eye "sight" and
               ear "hearing," so also they call a union that never ceases "bosom," as it is said:
               "Render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n70"/> that is to say let them
               receive punishment continually and always. The expression "only Son" that has been
               used signifies, therefore, that He is alone born of the Father, that He is alone Son,
               that He is always with His Father and is known with Him, because He is truly a Son
               from His Father.</p>
            <p>As to the expression "the first-born of all the creatures," we <pb n="39"/> understand it in
               the sense in which it is said: "For whom He did foreknow He also did predestinate,
               and He formed them to the image of His Son that He might be the first-born among many
               brethren."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71"/> (<persName>Paul</persName>) did not make use of this word in order to show us that He is Son
               alone, but in order to make us understand that He has many brethren and that He is
               known among many since they acquired with Him participation in the adoption of
               sons,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n72"/> and because of them He is called first-born as they are His brothers. In
               another passage He is called "first-born of all the creatures."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73"/> This is also said
               about the humanity of Christ, because (<persName>Paul</persName>) did not simply say "first-born" but
               "first-born of all the creatures."</p>
            <p>No one is called first-born if he has no other brothers because of whom he is called
               and is a first-born, so the expression "the first-born of all creatures" means that
               He was the first to be renewed by His resurrection from the dead; and He changed into
               a new and wonderful life, and He renewed also all the creatures and brought them to a
               new and a higher creation. It is indeed said: "Everything that is in Christ is a new
               creature. Old things are passed away, and all things are become new through our Lord
               Jesus Christ."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n74"/> He is the firstborn of all the creatures because all the creation
               was renewed and changed through the renewal which He granted to it by His grace from
               the renewal into which He Himself was renewed, and through which He moved to a new
               life and ascended high above all creatures.</p>
            <p>He is rightly called the first-born of all the creatures, because He was first
               renewed, and then He renewed the creatures, while He is higher in honour than all of
               them. This is how we understand the difference between the two names. Our Fathers,
               who took their wisdom from Holy Writ, referred this difference to one person and
               said: In the Only Begotten Son, the first-born of all creatures, in order to show us,
               as I said previously, the close union of the two natures. It is with justice,
               therefore, that they first said, "an only Son" and then, "the first-born." Indeed
               they had first to show us who was the one who was in the form of God,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n75"/> and who,
               because of His grace, took upon Him our nature, and afterwards to speak of that form
               of a servant which was assumed for our salvation. In this way and by the change in
               the terms that they used, they made manifest to us the two natures and <pb n="40"/>
               differences, and also the unity of sonship arising out of the closeness of the union
               of the natures, which was effected by the will of God. In this they kept also the
               right order of things as they taught first concerning Divine nature which by its
               grace came down to us and put on humanity, and then concerning that humanity which
               was assumed through grace, and afterwards they gave the true doctrine for the
               refutation of the heretics who strove to twist the truth.</p>
            <p>In their teaching they began later to speak of Divine nature about which they had
               already spoken at the beginning of the profession of faith: Who was bom before all
               the worlds, and not made. It is clear that they said these words concerning Divine
               nature, although the word "only Son" was sufficient to teach the true doctrine
               concerning the Son to all non-contentious. If He is an only Son, it is clear that He
               alone is born of God, and He alone is a Son con-substantial with His Father. The
               expression "only Son" denotes all these things, and even more, because those who are
               called sons of God are numerous, while this one is alone the only Son. It is, indeed
               written: "I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you children of the Most High,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n76"/> and
               again, "I have nourished and brought up children."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n77"/> Since there are many who are
               called "sons" this one would not have been called "an only Son" if there was not a
               great difference between them. They were called sons by grace because they became
               near to God and members of the household,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78"/> and because of this membership of the
               household they deserved by grace to be called by this name. This one, however, was
               called an only Son because He alone is a Son consubstantial with His Father. He was
               not called a Son, because He, like others, became by grace worthy of the adoption of
               sons, but because He was born of the very nature (of the Father) He was called and He
               is a Son. Although these things are clear and evident in the Sacred Books, and
               although it is patent to every one that no one can be called an only son except the
               one who is truly of the same nature as his father, the unholy and erroneous opinion
               of the heretics remained for some time without rectification.</p>
            <p>Of all those who had received the knowledge of Christ, <persName>Arius</persName> was the first to dare
               and to say impiously that the Son was a creature<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n79"/> and was made from nothing: a
               novel theory alien to public opinion and <pb n="41"/> to the laws of nature, as any one who is
               created is not a Son, and any one who is a Son is not a creature, because it is
               impossible that a creature should be called a true Son or a true Son to be called a
               creature. This compelled our blessed Fathers to assemble from all regions and hold a
               holy Synod in the town of <placeName>Nicea</placeName> in the district of <placeName>Bithynia</placeName>, and to write this
               (profession of) faith in order to uphold the true faith, to confute the wickedness of
               <persName>Arius</persName>, to refute those who sprang up later and who are called by the name of their
               deceiver <persName>Eunomius</persName>, and to overthrow those heresies which arose out of erroneous
               opinions. Although the question was clear and evident to all from the law of nature,
               from common consent and from the teaching of the Sacred Books, they added and said:
               Born and not made.</p>
            <p>They used words suitable to the belief in the Son, as if they had said: we call Him a
               Son, not a mere man and not like one who is figuratively called so—such as those who
               are by grace called children because of their adoption in the household—but alone a
               true Son. He is a true Son because He is an only Son; and He is truly born of His
               Father, is from Him and from His nature, and is eternally like Him. There is no
               created thing that is before the worlds, as the one who is before the worlds is the
               one who is alone from eternity. As the Father is from eternity so also the Son who is
               from Him is from eternity. He did not come into existence after a time nor was He
               born later, but He was born eternally before all the worlds from the one who is from
               eternity, and He is with Him from eternity as the evangelist said: "In the beginning
               was the Word."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n80"/></p>
            <p>He is from eternity, and did not come into existence later, but He was in the
               beginning before everything. He who comes into existence later is called "the last,"
               and the last is not the first; and he who is not the first was not in the beginning.
               If, therefore, He was in the beginning, He was also the first, as there is nothing
               that precedes the beginning. If He is the first He is not the last, and if He is not
               the last He did not come into existence later.</p>
            <p>In the beginning He was,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n81"/> and He was in the beginning from God, that is to say He
               was from eternity and before all the worlds with God. And to show that He was with
               God, and not from outside, as something foreign and not from the very nature of
               Divinity, the blessed evangelist called Him "Word," because a word belongs to <pb n="42"/> a
               man and is from a man; and since it is possible that the being who was with Him was
               from another he made use of this illustration so that the hearers should not doubt
               that He was from eternity from the one who is eternally from eternity. Indeed, the
               word of the soul, the rational character of which is accomplished in itself, is with
               it and in it by nature, and it is through it that this same soul is known to be
               rational. And it comes out of the soul, and is seen from it and in it, and is always
               with it and known through it.</p>
            <p>In this same way the Son is from the Father like the word is from the soul. He is
               eternally from Him, with Him and in Him, and He is known from eternity with Him. "He
               was in the beginning," that is to say He was from eternity, from the beginning, and
               before everything; not that He came into existence later, but that He was in the
               beginning and always; that He was eternally from Him and eternally with Him, like the
               word is with the soul, from which and with which it always is.</p>
            <p>The word, however, is seen as something different from the soul, and is the
               personality<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n82"/> of the soul, because not having its own personality it is seen in the
               soul. In order that, by following this illustration, we may not believe that the Son
               has no personality<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n82"/> or that He was alien to the nature of the Father he quickly
               added: "And the Word was God." After saying that He "was" and that He "was with God"
               he added "And the Word was God" so that he should show clearly that He was not from a
               nature different from that of God, or that He was different from Him in the Godhead,
               but that He was identical with the one from whom He was and that He was God with the
               one who was God.</p>
            <p>He said wonderfully: "And the Word was God" in order to show that He is what God is,
               and that He is what our blessed Fathers rightly described: Born of Him before all the
               worlds. In this they wished to convey that from eternity and before all the worlds He
               was in the beginning from Him and with Him. Their words did not stop here but to
               complete the doctrine of truth, to warn the children of faith and to overthrow the
               error of the heretics, they added the sentence: And not made.</p>
            <p>We should be in need of many words if we intended to comment fully upon all things
               said by our blessed Fathers concerning the Divinity <pb n="43"/> of the Only Begotten. In
               order, however, to lighten to you the burden of the many things that are said to you
               we shall utter them little by little so that you may better be able to hear and to
               learn them. With your permission, therefore, we shall put an end here to the things
               that were said to-day, and keep the things that follow (in the credo) to another day,
               and for all of them let us praise the Father, the Only Begotten Son and the Holy
               Spirit, now, always, and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the third chapter.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="4">
            <head>Chapter IV</head>
            <p>Yesterday we endeavoured to interpret to your love, according to our ability and in a
               succinct manner, the things said by our blessed Fathers concerning the Divinity of
               the Only Begotten, while we kept the remainder of them for another day. In our
               commentary we reached, as you remember, the sentence in which it is said: Born of His
               Father before all the worlds, and not made, and there we ended our speech. If you
               wish, let us now begin by the grace of our Lord with this sentence. We were stating
               that in saying: Born of His Father before all the worlds they showed us that He is a
               Son truly and not figuratively only, as the heretics pretend that He is a Son only in
               a borrowed name like those who were called sons by grace. He is indeed alone the true
               Son of God the Father because He is the Only Begotten and is alone born of God His
               Father. This is the reason why they added: Born of His Father before all the
               worlds.</p>
            <p>This was due to the Only Begotten Son of God, who is a true Son and not in name only.
               And He is from the nature of the Father and eternally from Him and with Him. It is
               not possible for us to imagine that there is anything between God the Father and God
               the Son, as God is high above everything. He who is above everything is also above
               the time and from eternity. If, therefore, God the Father is eternal, and if the Son
               is God, He is also eternal, God from God, and Eternal from Eternal, and there is
               nothing between God and God. As it is not possible to imagine that either times or
               worlds precede God, so there is nothing before the Son as He also is God, because He
               is born of His Father before everything, and is eternal, born of the One who is
               eternal.</p>
            <pb n="44"/>
            <p>For a perfect faith to those who have the good-will of religion this name of "Only
               Begotten" would have been sufficient, and they would have agreed to say that He was a
               true Son. (Our Fathers), however, added to it the sentence: Born of Him before all
               the worlds. Both phrases demonstrate how the Only Begotten is the Son of God, and it
               is with justice that they added for the refutation of the haters of truth: And not
               made. We confess that He is the Only Begotten, the Son of God, born of the Father
               before all the worlds, and that He is consubstantial with the Father; and we
               completely reject the opinion held by the ungodly people who said that the Son of God
               is created. He is indeed born of God and He is not made, and He is of the same nature
               as God and not a creature.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83"/> A Son is very different from a creature.</p>
            <p>If He is a Son He is not a creature, and if He is a creature He is not a Son. If He
               is a Son He is from Him and not from outside Him, and if He is a creature He is from
               outside Him. If He is a Son He is from Him and like Him, and if He is a creature He
               is from outside Him and not from Him and like Him. The natural law teaches us also
               these things, because we call sons those who are born of us; as to creatures they are
               made outside us while they were not. Likewise we understand that there are many
               creatures of God, but the Son is One whom we also call Only Begotten.</p>
            <p>The Son is one alone, and He is eternally from Him; as to creatures they are many and
               exceed all numbering, and are composed of many natures which came into existence
               later according to the will of their Maker, both individually and collectively. He
               knew that diversity was useful to the creature because it is created, and some parts
               of it came into existence earlier, some later and some others later still; parts of
               it came into existence at the same time, and parts after many others. Since all the
               created things were to come into existence it was justifiable that some should come
               earlier and some later.</p>
            <p>As there is a beginning to the existence of all created things, those which came into
               existence later are like those which came into existence earlier. As to the Son,
               because He did not come into existence to His Father later but was in the beginning
               from Him and was from eternity with Him, is alone Son. It was not possible that the
               one <pb n="45"/> who was similar to the one who is from eternity should have come into
               existence later, nor was it possible that the one who has a beginning should have
               been similar to the one who is from eternity. Indeed there is a great difference
               between one who is from eternity and one who began his existence later; the
               difference is so great that the two cannot exist concomitantly. What possible
               relation can exist between one who is eternal and another who was at one time
               nonexistent and began his existence later?</p>
            <p>It is well known that the one who is eternal and the one whose existence has a
               beginning are greatly separated from each other, and the gulf found between them is
               unbridgeable. The one who is eternal has no limits, while the one whose existence has
               a beginning, his very existence is limited, and the one the beginning of whose
               existence is limited, the time that elapsed before he came into existence is also
               limited. It is not possible to limit and define the chasm that exists between the one
               who is from eternity and the one who began to exist at a time when he was not. What
               possible resemblance and relation can exist between two beings so widely separated
               from each other? And because the Son is from eternity, and from a Father who is from
               eternity, no other son like Him came into existence later. He remained Son alone
               because He is from eternity from one who is from eternity. It was fitting that such a
               one should be alone the Son from the Father.</p>
            <p>In this way our Fathers warned us concerning the knowledge of the Son, and wrote to
               us the true doctrine to the effect that when we believe in the Only Begotten Son we
               should understand that He is from the Father. They taught us also to flee from the
               impiety of the heretics and reject their contention that the Son is made, as this is
               very remote from the truth. The Son should not be thought of as a made being nor as a
               creature, but we ought to profess concerning Father and Son what is congruous to both
               of them, namely that the Son is from the nature of the Father and is not a being made
               by the Father and created outside Him from nothing.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers taught us these and added something that fits the sequence of the
               sentence: True God of true God. Indeed what else were we justified in thinking of the
               one who is from God and not from outside Him but from the very nature of the Father,
               except that He was what God is by nature, that is to say a true God? <pb n="46"/> </p>
            <p>In this they followed the teaching of the Gospel in which it is said: "And the Word
               was with God, and the Word was God,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84"/> as if the evangelist had said, "And God was
               with God, and He was what He was, as He was with Him and from Him." In this way our
               Fathers said also: True God of true God. They added to the sentence, "God from God"
               that of, "True from true" because of the wickedness of those who wish to show
               contention and insolence even concerning heavenly<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85"/> things.</p>
            <p>The sentence which they used does not differ from that found in the Gospel, as it is
               clear that the one who says, "God with God" says also "A true one with a true one."
               The (Gospel) does not say "And He is called God," like those who are called gods by
               men, nor, "He was with the one who was called God by name only," but, He was God with
               the one who was God, and God by nature with the one who was God by nature. Men are
               called gods, but are not assumed to be gods by nature: "I have said, Ye are gods, and
               all of you children of the Most High, but ye shall die like men,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86"/> because I only
               called you so to bestow honour upon you, as you are not gods by nature; you are
               mortal men by nature, which is very different from Divine nature; this is evident
               from the nature of things, because if you had been gods by nature you would not have
               been entangled in sin for which you received death."</p>
            <p>God is not only called God by name, but He is in reality by nature that which is
               implied by His name; and God the Word who is with Him is not only called God
               figuratively, but is also God by nature; and he who is God by nature what else can he
               be except true God? What is there truer than nature, and how is it possible that the
               one who is (God) by nature should not be so in truth? If He is not God by nature, He
               is neither God in truth. Indeed this name "god" is either applied to demons, who
               falsely and insolently dare to call themselves by it in their arrogance, or to men
               who are called so by God's gracious permission as an honour. As to the Son He is God
               by nature like the Father.</p>
            <p>Although the heretics dare to call the Only Begotten, "Son of God" in a different
               sense, yet since He is God by nature it is evident that He is also God in truth, as
               there is nothing truer than the one who is what he is by nature. It is indeed evident
               that the one who is God by nature is also God in truth. And there is nothing truer
               than <pb n="47"/> a true one—(and this contrary to) the new wisdom of the heretics— when each
               of them is a true (God) by nature. Indeed they say that God the Father is God by
               nature and that God the Son is also God by nature, but they refuse to admit that the
               Son is God in truth, in spite of the fact that they admit that He is God by nature,
               and in this they introduce a new law to us in their innovations to the effect that He
               is a true God but not like God His Father. If each one of them is God by nature, how
               is it possible for us to understand that one of them is higher and the other lower
               while both of them are assumed to have an identical nature? It is impossible to find
               an addition or a diminution in the one whom the Sacred Books and those who followed
               their doctrine teach us that He is God by nature.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers also followed the Books and warned us against the unholy opinion
               and the ineptitude of the heretics, in saying: True God of true God. The Books had
               already stated that He was "God," and they (our Fathers) added prudently the word
               "true" so that we might believe that the Son is a true God like the Father, because
               like the Father He is a true God by nature. And as the Father was confessed as God
               for the confutation of the error of the multiplicity of gods—who were falsely called
               gods by the peoples of the earth—so also is the case with the Son of God, because we
               believe that God the Father and God the Son are one God, inasmuch as the Divine
               nature of the Father and of the Son is one.</p>
            <p>To this our blessed Fathers added that the Son was "consubstantial" with His Father,
               a word that confirms (the faith of) the children of faith and rebukes the
               unbelievers. Although this is not explicitly written in Holy Writ yet its meaning is
               found therein. They explained here by means of a clear word the meaning of that which
               they had previously stated, because the sentence: Consubstantial with the Father is
               not different from that of: True God of true God. They did not wish to insinuate by
               this sentence "Consubstantial with the Father any other thing than that the being
               who, as previously stated by them, was God and born of His Father before all the
               worlds and not made—is God. Indeed, if He is born of Him before all the worlds and is
               not made, and if He is not a creature but a true Son of His Father, it is evident
               that He is from Him and not from outside Him, and that He is born of the nature of
               the Father and consubstantial with Him; and if He is true God of true God, it is <pb n="48"/>
               evident that He is consubstantial with Him,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87"/> because any one who is truly God in
               nature is consubstantial with one who is truly God in nature.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the sentence "consubstantial with His Father" is clearly found in the
               Book. When it says: "In the beginning He was with God and He was God,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88"/> it shows by
               means of these two phrases that He is God in nature and that He is consubstantial
               with God. This is also the meaning of the sentence: "My Father and I are one."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89"/> If
               the Son is one with His Father in power and in nature, He is consubstantial with Him.
               By His statement: "My sheep hear my voice and follow me, and I give unto them eternal
               life, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90"/> He bore witness to His
               omnipotence and to the fact that no man can prevail against Him; and because this
               sentence conveyed higher things than the simple man who was seen in Him, He added:
               "My Father who gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck (them)
               out of my Father's hand."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91"/> He lowered the significance of the sentence by the
               addition: "He gave me." What He said of Himself to the effect that no man can prevail
               against Him, He said it of His person; and to show that He did make use of such words
               for the purpose of showing that the power of both (the Father and the Son) was
               identical and that no man was able to prevail against Him in the same way as no man
               was able to prevail against the Father who was believed to be higher than all, He
               said: "My Father and I are one."</p>
            <p>He made clear in this (sentence) that which He had implicitly insinuated in the
               meaning of the preceding words which He had uttered; it is as if He had said, "my
               power is identical with that of my Father and higher than all like His power, and no
               man can prevail against me even as no man can prevail against my Father, because my
               Father and I are one, and have one power and one dominion that is higher than all."
               This is the reason why the Jews called Him a blasphemer. Indeed they did not know the
               Divine nature that was dwelling in Him, but knew only that which was visible in Him,
               and wished to stone Him like a man making use of blasphemous words.</p>
            <p>To the same effect is the sentence: "He that hath seen me hath <pb n="49"/> seen my Father,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n92"/> 
               and: "I am in my Father and my Father in me."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n93"/> If the Father is seen in the Son
               it is evident that both have one nature, and each of them is seen and known in the
               other. In this way their mutual equality shows also the unity of their nature, and
               the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father. This is likewise the meaning of the
               sentence: "No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father
               save the Son."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n94"/> If each of them is not known and seen except by the other, it is
               evident that they are invisible to all men because of their equality in nature, each
               of them only knowing the other. If this is so then the Son is consubstantial with the
               Father.</p>
            <p>In spite of the fact that all these things are manifestly evident in the Sacred
               Books, those who incline towards evil, to the condemnation of their souls, and are
               not upright, dared to say that the nature of the Son is different from that of the
               Father, a saying which also implies that He is not a Son. It is known that he who is
               truly a son is of the same nature as his father. Our blessed Fathers were well
               advised, therefore, to make use of this expression the meaning of which was
               implicitly found in many words of the Sacred Books, in order to warn the faithful of
               their time and to rebuke the heretics; and they wished also to make it known in
               condensed words. If the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> did not hesitate to quote in his teaching
               sentences that were used by Greek philosophers, such as: "we are of the offspring of
               gods,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95"/> and: "The Cretans are always 
               liars, evil beasts, slow bellies,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n96"/> and if
               he did not shrink from writing them for the reproval of his adversaries, it was all
               the more right for our blessed Fathers to make use in the profession of faith of the
               expression that the Son was Consubstantial with the Father, and although this word is
               not explicitly written in the Sacred Books, its meaning was implicitly found in many
               passages.</p>
            <p>After this they said: By Whom the worlds were made and all things were created.</p>
            <p>As in the section of the faith which deals with the Father, after the word "Father"
               they added "Creator of all things," so also in the section which deals with the Son,
               after stating that He was born of the Father and was consubstantial with Him, they
               rightly added that He was the creator of all things, because a true Son <pb n="50"/> who is
               consubstantial with His Father is also a true creator like Him. In this same way the
               blessed <persName>John</persName> the evangelist, after having said "in the beginning He was with God, and
               He was God"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n97"/> added: "All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything
               made,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n98"/> in order to show us that He was a creator like God His Father.</p>
            <p>In this same way after our blessed Fathers had said that the Son was from the Father,
               that He was true God from true God and that He was consubstantial with His Father,
               they added: By whom the worlds were made and all things were created. They said this
               because as He is with His Father before all the worlds, He is the creator of all
               things like God His Father. And since the worlds were made by Him, He is the creator
               of all creatures, and He is before all the worlds, because He is from eternity and
               did not begin to exist later, but was in the beginning and is the creator of all the
               worlds, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: "By Him He made the worlds."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n99"/></p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers also after saying like him: "By Him the worlds were made," added
               that He was the creator of all things. In this way they taught us the divinity of the
               Only Begotten while stating something which was in harmony with the Sacred Books; and
               gave also encouragement to those who are zealous in their religion, and confuted
               those who deny the divinity of the Only Begotten.</p>
            <p>As to us we have explained to your love the meaning of the (profession of) faith in a
               succinct manner, according to our ability. If you wish it let the measure of the
               things which we said suffice for our teaching of to-day, and let us praise the
               Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the fourth chapter. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="5">
            <head>Chapter V</head>
            <p>I know that you remember what we spoke to your love concerning the divinity of the
               Only Begotten, and how our blessed Fathers after their teaching about the Father came
               to the words written in the Sacred Books concerning the Son, and taught us both about
               the divinity of the Son and the form of man which He assumed for our <pb n="51"/>
               salvation.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n100"/> They thought not to keep silent on the human nature which He put on
               because it is through it that we received the knowledge of the Divine nature of the
               Only Begotten.</p>
            <p>After saying: And in one Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ, in order to make manifest the Divine
               nature and the human nature they added: The Only Begotten Son, the first-born of all
               creatures, and they further instructed us concerning Divine nature and the form of
               man which was put on for our salvation so that little by little they might teach us
               everything with accuracy.</p>
            <p>They first taught us how to believe in the divinity of the Only Begotten by saying
               that the Only Begotten Son was consubstantial with the Father, and not a Son with
               only an assumed name like other men who are so by grace and not by nature, but that
               He was a true Son from the Father; that He was an only Son, because He alone was born
               of the nature of His Father; that He did not become Son or was called so later, but
               that He was in the beginning, before all the worlds and eternally from His Father,
               and was not made. The reason why the Son of God should not be called a creature of
               God, is that He did not come into existence from nothing according to the law of all
               created beings, but He is eternally from His Father, "a true God of true God, and
               consubstantial with His Father," because He is a true Son and is by nature what the
               one who begat Him is.</p>
            <p>Our fathers taught us these things with accuracy concerning the divinity of the Only
               Begotten, and fixed the profession of faith in our souls while removing from us the
               contention of the ungodly who dare to assert that the Son of God, who was born
               eternally from His Father before all the worlds, is made and created. After having
               shaken from our mind all the falsehood of the error of the heretics, they began to
               speak of the Incarnation of our Lord which took place for our salvation, in saying:
               Who for us children of men and for our salvation came down from heaven, was incarnate
               and became a man.</p>
            <p>It is with justice that they first used the sentence "for us children of men and for
               our salvation." Because they were on the point of speaking about the Economy of His
               humanity, they were bound to show the purpose of it, as they could not do this with
               the words which <pb n="52"/> dealt with the divinity of the Only Begotten and in which they
               spoke to us how He was eternally from His Father. Since they took pains to teach us
               concerning His humanity, it is with justice that before everything they set forth the
               reason for which Divine nature humbled itself to the extent of taking upon itself the
               form of a servant for us<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n101"/> and of its caring for our salvation. It is with justice,
               therefore, that our Fathers, in beginning their teaching concerning the Economy of
               His humanity, formed the starting-point of their discourse from this purpose: For us
               children of men and for our salvation. It was also fitting on their part to place the
               words "for our salvation" after the words "for us children of men," in order that
               they might show the aim of His coming, which was not only for the "children of men"
               but also "for their salvation." He came down from heaven to save and to deliver from
               evil, by an ineffable grace, those who were lost<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n102"/> and given up to iniquities.</p>
            <p>He came down not in the sense that He moved from place to place. We are not to think
               that Divine nature which is everywhere moves from place to place; because this Divine
               nature has no body, it cannot be circumscribed in a place.. He who is not
               circumscribed is everywhere, and He who is everywhere it is not possible for us to
               think of Him that He moves from place to place. To this the blessed <persName>John</persName> bears
               witness when he says: "He was in the world and the world was made by Him and the
               world knew Him not. He came unto His own and His own received Him not."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n103"/> He says
               here that "He was in the world" and that "He came unto the world"; but if He was in
               the world how did He come to it? Indeed, how can we say that a man came to a place
               where he was? He, therefore, said "He was in the world" in order to show that He is
               everywhere; and he added: "He came unto His own," about the Economy of His humanity.
               Likewise the blessed <persName>David</persName> said: "He bowed the heavens and came down,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104"/> in order
               to make manifest to us the deliverance from their tribulations which God effected for
               them. He called the condescension of God the "coming down" of God, in the sense that
               He who was so much above all condescended to deliver them from their tribulations. <pb n="53"/> </p>
            <p>It is in this sense that God the Word, the only Son of God, is said to have come down
               for our salvation, because He is eternally from His Father, is always with Him, and
               is above all as He is the cause of everything. For our salvation He condescended to
               come down to such a humility as to take upon Him the form of a servant<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n105"/> and be in
               it so that through it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n106"/> He might grant us the delight of His abundant gift. It is
               with justice, therefore, that our blessed Fathers said: Who for us children of men
               and for our salvation came down from heaven. They called the Economy of His humanity
               a "coming down from heaven," at which the blessed <persName>David</persName> was awe-struck and said:
               "What is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that Thou visitest
               him?"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n107"/></p>
            <p>Who for us children of men and for our salvation came down from heaven: what is His
               coming down and what is its aim? And what did [man] do that He humbled Himself to
               such an extent for him as to become like him, and to take upon Him the form of a
               servant, and to be a man for our salvation, and to make Himself manifest to all, and
               to assume upon Himself all that which belonged to the nature of that man, and to be
               exercised in all (human) faculties? And He perfected him by His power, so that He did
               not remove from him the (bodily) death which he received according to the law of his
               nature,—but while He was with him He delivered him by act of grace from (real) death
               and from the corruption of the grave,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n108"/> and raised him from the dead, and made him
               worthy of a high honour concerning which he said: "Destroy this temple, and in three
               days I will raise it up,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n109"/> which he did; and He was not separated from him in his
               crucifixion nor did He leave him at death, but He remained with him until He helped
               him to loose<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n110"/> the pains of 
               death,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n111"/> and He delivered his soul from bonds which
               were indissoluble; and He raised him from the dead and transferred him to immortal
               life,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n112"/> and made him immortal, incorruptible and immutable; and He caused him to go
               up to heaven where he is now sitting at the right hand of God; <pb n="54"/> and he is "far
               above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is
               named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n113"/> as the blessed
               <persName>Paul</persName> testifies; and he constantly receives adoration from all creation because of his
               close union with God the Word.</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that our blessed Fathers said that He was incarnate
               and became a man, so that for the sake of our salvation He might act according to all
               this Economy whereby He was believed to be a mere man by those who were unaware of
               the Godhead which was dwelling in Him and who only saw that which was visible. Indeed
               the Jews said to Him: "For good works we stone Thee not, but for blasphemy; and
               because that Thou, being a man, makest Thyself God."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n114"/> And <persName>Paul</persName> also said, "He was
               in the likeness of men, and was found in fashion as a man."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n115"/> The (sentence) "He
               was in the likeness of men" does not mean any other thing than that He became a man.
               When the Book said: "God sent His own Son who became in the likeness of the sinful
               flesh,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n116"/> the "likeness of the flesh" does not mean any other thing than flesh
               itself; and so also when in another passage it says: "He was manifest in the 
               flesh."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n117"/> In this passage it uses "flesh" and in the other "likeness of the flesh," but by
               the two expressions "flesh" and "likeness of the flesh" it does not show us any other
               thing than that it teaches us that He was manifest in the flesh, in the same way as
               "in the likeness of man" does not mean any other thing than "man."</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that our blessed Fathers said: He was incarnate and
               became a man in order to show that He was a man, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> testifies, and
               that He fulfilled this Economy for the salvation of all. It is with justice then that
               our blessed Fathers made use of this word in the profession of faith for the
               refutation of the error of the heretics, while conforming with the true belief of the
               Church. And on account of the numerous schisms that had taken place among men
               concerning that ineffable Economy and concerning the man whom our Lord assumed, they
               rightly made use of the sentence: He was incarnate and became a man.</p>
            <p>The Marcionites and the Manicheans together with the followers of <persName>Valentinus</persName> and the
               rest of the heretics who were affected with <pb n="55"/> a like malady, say that our Lord did
               not assume any of our natures either of the body or the soul, but that He was a
               phantasm that struck the eyes of men like the form of the visions which the prophets
               saw and the apparition seen by <persName>Abraham</persName> of three men of whom none had a corporeal
               nature but who were only in appearance men who performed human acts, walked, talked,
               were washed, ate and drank. They say that in this same way our Lord did not assume
               any body but that He was only in appearance a man who performed and felt everything
               according to the requirements of men, while the one who was seen had no human nature
               but was only seen in appearance to be so, and that in reality He felt nothing but
               only the onlookers believed that He was feeling.</p>
            <p>The partisans of <persName>Arius</persName> and <persName>Eunomius</persName>, however, say that He assumed a body but not a
               soul, and that the nature of the Godhead took the place of the soul. They lowered the
               Divine nature of the Only Begotten to the extent that from the greatness of its
               nature it moved and performed the acts of the soul and imprisoned itself in the body
               and did everything for its sustenance. Lo, if the Godhead had replaced the soul He
               would not have been hungry or thirsty, nor would He have tired or been in need of
               food. All these things befall the body because of its weakness, as the soul is not
               able to satisfy its wants, but does for it only those things that belong to 
               itself<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n118"/> according to the nature given to it by God. The soul is in need of a body which
               is perfect in everything that deals with its sustenance, and if something is missing
               in it, not only this same soul is unable to help it but will itself be overcome by
               the weakness of the body, and will be compelled to leave it against its own will.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, the Godhead was performing the acts of the soul, it would also by
               necessity have performed the acts of the body. Only in this way could be right the
               opinion of the misleading heretics who deny that He assumed a body and was only seen
               in the same way as the angels (were seen in the Old Testament), and was a man in
               appearance only while He did not possess any qualities of human nature. Indeed the
               Godhead was able to accomplish everything so that the eyes which were seeing believed
               that they were seeing a real man,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n119"/> in the same way as the angels were, by the will
               of God, seen by <persName>Abraham</persName>. <pb n="56"/> </p>
            <p>If, however, Divine nature was sufficient for all these things, human nature which
               was in need of the grace of salvation from God should not have been assumed, as
               according to the opinion of the heretics this same Godhead would have satisfied the
               requirements of human nature, and in this case it would have been superfluous to
               assume a body at all as the Godhead was able to perform all its acts. This, however,
               was not the will of God, who indeed wished to put on and raise the fallen man who is
               composed of a body and of an immortal and rational soul, so that "as by one man sin
               entered the world, and death by sin, so also the free gift and the grace of God by
               the righteousness of one man might abound unto many."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n120"/> As death was by man so also
               the resurrection from the dead (will be) by man, because "as we all die in <persName>Adam</persName>, even
               so in Christ shall all be made alive,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n121"/> as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> testifies. Therefore
               it was necessary that He should assume not only the body but also the immortal and
               rational soul; and not only the death of the body had to cease but also that of the
               soul, which is sin. Since according to the sentence of the blessed (<persName>Paul</persName>) sin entered
               the world through man, and death entered through sin, it was necessary that sin which
               was the cause of death should have first been abolished, and then the abolition of
               death would have followed by itself. If sin were not abolished we would have by
               necessity remained in mortality, and we would have sinned in our mutability; and when
               we sin, we are under punishment, and consequently the power of death will by
               necessity remain.</p>
            <p>It was, therefore, necessary that sin should have first been abolished, as after its
               abolition there would be no entry for death. It is indeed clear that the strength of
               the sin<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n122"/> has its origin in the will of the soul. In the case of <persName>Adam</persName> also it was
               his soul which first accepted the advice of error and not his body, because it was
               not his body that <persName>Satan</persName> persuaded to yield to him, to forsake God and to believe that
               his Helper was a deceiver, in his desire for higher things; and in following the
               advice of <persName>Satan</persName> he transgressed the commandment of God and chose for himself those
               things which were contrary to the commandment of God. It was not his body that had to
               know these things but his soul which, on the promise of higher things, yielded and
               accepted the advice of the deceiver and lost the good things that it possessed. <pb n="57"/> </p>
            <p>It was, therefore, necessary that Christ should assume not only the body but also the
               soul. The enemy of the soul had to be removed first and then for the sake of it that
               of the body, because if death is from sin and the same death is the corruption of the
               body, sin would have first to be abolished and the abolition of death would follow by
               itself.</p>
            <p>It would be possible to save the body from death and corruption if we first made the
               soul immutable and delivered it from the passions of sin, so that by acquiring
               immutability we would also obtain deliverance from sin. The abolition of death would
               then be effected by the abolition of sin, and after the abolition of death it would
               be possible that our body should remain without dissolution and corruption. If the
               soul had only sinned in those things that befall it from the passions of the body, it
               would perhaps have been sufficient for our Lord to have assumed only the body in
               order to deliver (the soul) from sin. Many, however, and of different kinds are the
               iniquities and sins that are born of the soul. The first (sin) through which it shows
               its association with <persName>Satan</persName> is that of pride, about which the Apostle said: <quote>Lest
               being lifted up in pride he should fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n123"/> In
               this sentence the Apostle has shown that any one who falls into pride becomes the
               associate of the Devil in condemnation. The one, therefore, who possesses the
               uncorporeal Devil in his evil thought, feels passion in his soul; and consequently it
               is clearly evident that the soul was greatly in need to be delivered from sins and be
               saved also from the passions of the body which overcome it by the power that the
               latter adequately possesses.</p>
            <p>The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> bears witness to our words when he counts the evils to which men
               were drawn, to which they degraded themselves and from which Christ came into the
               world to deliver them; he says thus: <quote>Wherefore God gave them over to a reprobate
               mind to do that thing which is not convenient, being filled with all unrighteousness,
               wickedness, covetousness, fornication, maliciousness, envy, murder, debate, deceit,
               malignity; and are disobedient to their parents, implacable and unmerciful.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n124"/>
               These (evils) are clear and evident and in no need of a comment, and the majority of
               them are not born of the passions of the body but exclusively of the will of the
               soul. Indeed wickedness, maliciousness, envy, debate, deceit and malignity, together
               with pride, boasting, invention of evil things, disobedience to parents, <pb n="58"/>
               non-understanding, covenant-breaking, and unmercifulness—all these are clearly from
               the soul.</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that our Lord assumed the soul so that it should be
               first delivered from sin and be transferred to immutability by the grace of God
               through which it overcomes also the passions of the body. When sin is abolished from
               every place and has no more entry into the soul which has become immutable, every
               kind of condemnation will rightly be abolished and death also will perish. The body
               will thus remain immune from death because it has received participation in
               immortality. The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> confirms this in saying: <quote>There is therefore now no
               condemnation to them who are in Christ <persName>Jesus</persName>, who walk not after the flesh, for the
               law of life in Christ <persName>Jesus</persName> hath made thee free from the law of sin and death.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n125"/></p>
            <p>He said that all the sentence of death,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n126"/> together with all condemnation, has been
               removed to those who believed in Christ, because they became alien to the way of
               mortality and received the Spirit and immortality, and with it they assumed
               immutability and became completely free from sin and mortality. It is, therefore,
               great madness not to believe that Christ assumed the soul; and he would even be
               madder who would say that He did not assume human mind, because such a one would
               imply that He either did not assume the soul or that He did assume the soul not of
               man but an irrational one akin to that of animals and beasts.</p>
            <p>Human soul differs only from that of animals in the fact that the latter has no
               distinct person<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n127"/> of the soul except in the (material) composition of the
               animal,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n128"/> and so it has no separate existence, and is not believed to survive after
               the death of the animal. This is the reason why what is called the soul of the
               animal, which is said to reside in its blood,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n129"/> perishes when the blood is shed; and
               it is the soul that was believed to reside in the person and in the movements of the
               animal <pb n="59"/> before its death. The soul of men, however, is not like this, but it
               resides in its own person and is much higher than the body, as the body is mortal and
               acquires its life from the soul and dies and perishes whenever the soul happens to
               leave it. As to the soul, when it goes out it remains and does not perish but lasts
               forever in its own person because it is immortal and is incapable of receiving any
               injury<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n130"/> in its nature from men. When (<persName>Christ</persName>) said: <quote>Fear not them which kill the
               body but are not able to kill the soul,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n131"/> He clearly showed that the body is
               capable of death because it is mortal, but that the soul will remain immortal because
               it cannot be injured by men in its nature.</p>
            <p>The difference between the soul of men and the soul of animals is such that the
               latter is irrational and has no person,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n132"/> while the former is immortal and is
               rightly believed to be also rational. Who is, therefore, so mad and devoid of human
               understanding as to assert that human soul is without knowledge and without reason,
               unless he wishes to be a teacher of a novel theory not found previously in the world
               to the effect that there exists an immortal nature which lives in an imperishable
               life but which is itself irrational? Such a thing is indeed impossible, because
               anything that is immortal in its nature and dwells in an imperishable life is also
               truly rational and endowed with reason.</p>
            <p>Because of all this our blessed Fathers warned us and said: He was incarnate and
               became a man, so that we should believe that the one who was assumed and in whom God
               the Word dwelt was a complete man, perfect in everything that belongs to human
               nature, and composed of a mortal body and a rational soul, because it is for man and
               for his salvation that He came down from heaven.</p>
            <p>They rightly said that He assumed a man who resembles<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n133"/> those from whom He was
               assumed, because the man whom He assumed resembles <persName>Adam</persName> who introduced sin into the
               world, so that He might abolish sin by one who was of the same nature. Indeed, He put
               on a man resembling <persName>Adam</persName> who after having sinned received the punishment of death, so
               that He might eradicate sin from us and abolish death by similar means. When He said:
               <quote>The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n134"/> He showed that such
               was the <pb n="60"/> reason for His resurrection from the dead, because <persName>Satan</persName> was holding the
               reins of the power of death on account of the sin that was cleaving to us, as <persName>Paul</persName>
               said,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n135"/> and was always working<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n136"/> for death.</p>
            <p>And because when we were subjected to sin<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n137"/> we had no hope of deliverance, the
               grace of God kept that man whom God put on for us free from sin, but <persName>Satan</persName> came with
               his deceitfulness and brought death upon Him as upon (any other) man, when he roused
               all the Jews against Him; and since He was not touched by sin which would subject Him
               to death, Christ our Lord received also upon Himself the death which with wickedness
               the tyrannical <persName>Satan</persName> brought upon Him. He showed to God that there was no sin in Him
               and that it was through injustice that He was enduring the trial of death. And He
               effected<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n138"/> the abolition of condemnation with ease, and He rose from the dead by
               the power of God and became worthy of a new and ineffable life which He generalised
               to all the human kind.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why our Lord said here: <quote>The prince of this world cometh, and hath
               nothing in me.</quote> In another passage He said: <quote>Now is the judgment of this world: now
               shall the prince of this world be condemned and cast out, and I when I am lifted up
               from the earth will draw all (men) unto me.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n139"/> In the first passage He shows that
               <persName>Satan</persName> had not one just cause for bringing death upon Him, and in the second that He
               had summoned the Rebel to a kind of judgment<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n140"/> where he had condemned him and cast
               him out of his iniquitous power, and that after obtaining these good things He would
               make all men partakers of His glory.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers said that He became incarnate so that you might understand that
               He assumed a complete man, who was a man not only in appearance but a man in a true
               human nature, and that you might believe that He assumed not only the body but the
               whole man who is composed of a body and of an immortal and rational soul. It is such
               a man that He assumed for our salvation and it is through Him that He effected
               salvation for our life, because He was justified and became blameless by the power of
               the Holy Spirit, as the blessed <pb n="61"/> <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>He was justified in the Spirit,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141"/>
                  and again: <quote>Who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n142"/>
               If He suffered death according to the law of men, because He had no sin He rose from
               the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit and became worthy of a new life in which the
               wishes of the soul are immutable, and He made the body immortal and incorruptible.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n143"/>
               In this He made us all participants in His promises, and as an earnest of His
               promises He gave us the first-fruits of the Spirit<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n144"/> so that we might possess a
               faith without doubts concerning future things; and <quote>He established us with you in
               Christ and sealed us and gave the earnest of His spirit in our hearts.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n145"/></p>
            <p>We also expect to be immortal and incorruptible at the resurrection from the dead
               when there will be no entry for sin into us. The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> bears witness to this
               in saying: <quote>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
               immortality; and when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
               mortal immortality, there shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, '
               Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
               victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n146"/> He means
               that when we have risen from the dead immortal and incorruptible and our nature has
               received immutability, we shall be unable to sin, and when we have been freed from
               sin we shall not need the law. Indeed what is the need of the law for a nature which
               is freed from sin and which has no inclination towards evil.</p>
            <p>Well did the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> say after these: <quote>Who gave us the victory through our Lord
               <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n147"/> This shows that it is God who was for us the source of all good
               things, and it is He who gave us the victory over all adversaries, either death or
               sin or any other evil born of them: He who for us put on the man our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> and
               transferred Him through His resurrection from the dead to a new life, and placed Him
               at His right hand, and gave us by His grace <pb n="62"/> communion with Him,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n148"/> when, in
               truth, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>our vile body shall be changed and be fashioned
               like unto His glory.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n149"/></p>
            <p>Because the things said by our blessed Fathers concerning the humanity of our Lord
               are many let us put an end here to our teaching of to-day, and let us praise the
               Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit now, always, and for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Here ends the fifth chapter. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="6">
            <head>Chapter VI</head>
            <p>In what we have already said we have explained to your love that which was said by
               our blessed Fathers concerning the humanity of our Lord in the profession of faith,
               which they wrote and handed down to us according to the teaching of the Books. We
               were obliged to use many words so that you might thoroughly understand all the
               meaning of their sentences, and if it were possible we would have said more in order
               to confirm the truth and to refute the deceitful words of the heretics, but the
               measure of what we said was considered by us to be sufficient to all those who
               possess goodwill in religion, because to those who have an unwilling mind, even a
               long discourse will be of no avail, while to those who possess a good will a short
               discourse will suffice for the demonstration of the truth, when (this discourse) is
               drawn from the testimony of Holy Writ. Let us then embark to-day, by the assistance
               of the grace of God, on the continuation of that which we said previously.</p>
            <p>After having said: Who for us children of men and for our salvation came down from
               heaven and was incarnate and became a man (our blessed Fathers) added: And was born of
               the Virgin <persName>Mary</persName> and crucified in the days of <persName>Pontius Pilate</persName>. They might have said
               many things that happened in the meantime such as He was wrapped in swaddling
               clothes, was laid in a manger, was under the law,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n150"/> was baptised and made manifest
               the works of the Gospel and many more things. If they had wished it they would have
               narrated all that the Sacred Books have taught us about Him and that <pb n="63"/> which was
               accomplished by Him for our salvation, as He fulfilled thoroughly the law of nature
               for us, because He was going to reform our nature, and He further observed the law of
               <persName>Moses</persName> so that He might pay our debt to the Lawgiver; and He was baptised so that He
               might give an emblem to the grace of our baptism; and He showed effectively in
               Himself the Economy of the Gospel to all men. After all these He went to crucifixion
               and death so that He might destroy the last enemy, which is death, and make manifest
               the new and immortal life.</p>
            <p>Our Fathers, however, took trouble to say all these things in short terms so that the
               hearers might learn them with ease, and so that we might also learn thoroughly every
               one of them from the Sacred Books. They wrote and arranged the Creed in short terms,
               and this is the reason why they said: Who was born of the Virgin <persName>Mary</persName> and was
               crucified in the days of <persName>Pontius Pilate</persName>. They only said the beginning and the end of
               the Economy that took place on our behalf, as the beginning of all grace is His birth
               of <persName>Mary</persName>, and its end is crucifixion. They called crucifixion the Passion, and all
               those things which took place in it. They included all of them in one word because
               from the Cross arose death and from death immortal life, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said
               also<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n151"/>: <quote>The preaching of the Cross is 
               to them that do not believe<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n152"/> foolishness,
               but unto us which are saved<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n153"/> 
               it is the power of God.</quote> He also said: "Though He was
               crucified through weakness yet He liveth by the power of 
               God."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n154"/> He showed here
               that the word of the Cross is the power of God to those who are saved because it is
               with His hand that He destroyed death and made new life manifest.</p>
            <p>In their profession of faith our blessed Fathers wrote, therefore, in short terms, at
               the beginning and at the end, all those things that were done in the interval, in
               order to extend their knowledge to all those willing to learn the truth. It is
               obvious that they do not teach that the Divine nature of the Only Begotten was born
               of a woman, as if it had its beginning in her, because they did not say that the one
               who was born of His Father before all the worlds and who is eternally from Him and
               with Him had His beginning from <persName>Mary</persName>, but they followed the Sacred Books which speak
               differently of natures <pb n="64"/> while referring (them) to one prosopon on account of the
               close union that took place between them, so that they might not be believed that
               they were separating the perfect union between the one who was assumed and the one
               who assumed. If this union were destroyed the one who was assumed would not be seen
               more than a mere man like ourselves. The Sacred Books refer the two words<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n155"/> as if
               to one Son, so that they might show in the same faith both the glory of the Only
               Begotten and the honour of the man whom He assumed.</p>
            <p>Indeed, after the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> had said: <quote>Of whom Christ (came),</quote> he added:
               <quote>according to the flesh,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n156"/> in order to separate the natures and to show that he is
               speaking of Christ who is from the Jews according to the flesh and that he is naming
               neither the nature of the Godhead of the Only Begotten, nor God the Word who was from
               the beginning with God and who is eternally in the bosom of His Father, but the form
               of the man which He assumed. And so that by this word and this addition to the effect
               that the human nature of Christ was taken <quote>from the Jews</quote> the glory of Christ might
               not be brought low, or that He might be believed that since He is man by nature and
               is born of children of men, He has nothing more, he added the sentence which follows:
               <quote>He is God over all</quote> in order to show the glory of Christ, which is from God the Word
               who assumed Him and united Him to Himself, as He is the cause of all and Lord over
               all. And because of the close union that this man has with God the Son, He is
               honoured and worshipped by all the creation.</p>
            <p>While the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> might have said: <quote>In whom is God over all</quote> he did not do so,
               but said: <quote>He is God over all,</quote> because of the close union between the two natures.
               He did not believe that He who was born of the Jews according to the flesh is God
               over all by nature, nor did he profess that the human nature is the cause of all and
               is Lord of all by nature, but he professed that the form of man which He assumed was
               Christ in the flesh, and Him who assumed that form he called God over all; he,
               however, mentioned these two things together in order to show the distinction found
               between the natures. Nobody believes that He who is from the Jews according to the
               flesh is God by nature, nor that God who is above <pb n="65"/> all is from the Jews by
               nature;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n157"/> he said the two things together in order to show the close union that took
               place between the one who was assumed and the one who assumed, and in order that
               together with the difference in natures the honour and the glory that came to the man
               who was assumed from his union with God who assumed him, might be known to all.</p>
            <p>He wrote something similar to this to the Philippians in saying: <quote>Who, being in the
               form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no
               reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of
               men and was found in the fashion of a man.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n158"/> Here also he clearly made a
               distinction between the natures and between Him who is in the form of God and Him who
               is in the form of a servant, between Him who assumed and Him who was assumed, and (he
               showed) also that He who assumed became in the fashion of a man in Him who was
               assumed. He who was assumed was truly in the fashion of a man, in whom was found the
               one who assumed Him; and He who assumed, while not a man, became in His incorporeal
               and immaterial nature in the form of a servant, which by nature was corporeal and
               material; and He was a man<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n159"/> according to the law of human body. He thus hid
               Himself at the time in which. He was in the world and conducted Himself with the
               children of men in such a way that all those who beheld Him in a human way and did
               not understand anything more, believed Him to be a mere man.</p>
            <p>In saying this he made a clear distinction between the natures of the one who is in
               the form of God and the one who is in the form of a servant, of the one who assumed
               and the one who was assumed. And he taught us also about the human nature in which
               our Lord was, as he said congruous things concerning the form of the servant which He
               assumed: <quote>He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
               Cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above
               every name: that at the name of <persName>Jesus</persName> every knee should bow of things in heaven and
               things in earth and things under the earth, and that every <pb n="66"/> tongue should confess
               that <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ is Lord to the glory of God His Father.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n160"/></p>
            <p>It is not Divine nature that received death, but it is clear that it was that man who
               was assumed as a temple to God the Word, (a temple) which was dissolved and then
               raised by the one who had assumed it. And after the Crucifixion it was not Divine
               nature that was raised but the temple which was assumed, which rose from the dead,
               ascended to heaven and sat at the right hand of God;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n161"/> nor is it to Divine
               nature—the cause of everything—that it was given that every one should worship it and
               every knee should bow, but worship was granted to the form of a servant which did not
               in its nature possess (the right to be worshipped). While all these things are
               clearly and obviously said of human nature he referred them successively to Divine
               nature so that his sentence might be strengthened and be acceptable to hearers.
               Indeed, since it is above human nature that it should be worshipped by all, it is
               with justice that all this has been said as of one, so that the belief in a close
               union between the natures might be strengthened, because he clearly showed that the
               one who was assumed did not receive all this great honour except from the Divine
               nature which assumed Him and dwelt in Him.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers wrote in the Creed something that is in harmony with this. They
               first taught us about the nature of the Godhead of the Only Begotten, that He is from
               the Father before all the worlds, that He is born of the nature of the Father and not
               made, and that He is a true God and consubstantial with God because He is born of His
               Father. After having taught us these things concerning the divinity of the Only
               Begotten they proceeded to teach us concerning the Economy of His humanity and said:
               Who for us children of men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was
               incarnate and became a man like us in order to effect salvation for all the human
               race. And they taught all those things that happened to the human nature: things
               through which God wished His Economy to be accomplished on our behalf. And He who was
               assumed for our salvation bore upon Himself all things affecting mankind, and became
               worthy of perfection and a source of benefits for us through our communion with Him. <pb n="67"/> </p>
            <p>They said the above things as of one in conformity with the teaching of the Books;
               not that human acts were affecting God in His nature, but they referred these human
               acts to Him because of the close union, so that the high things that happened to Him
               after the Passion—things that transcend human nature—might be believed, and so that
               all might accept them when learning that it was Divine nature which put on man and
               that by its union with Him He received all this honour and glory.</p>
            <p>Many things, as we have said, happened to Him according to human law; things which we
               may learn from the Gospel. He was wrapped in swaddling clothes after He was born and
               laid in a manger;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n162"/> He was 
               circumcised after the custom of the law and was brought
               to the temple according to the order of <persName>Moses</persName>; He was shown before the Lord and
               endured all things dealing<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n163"/> with 
               His increase in stature, wisdom and favour, while
               He was subject unto His parents;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n164"/> 
               He practised in a right way all (things dealing
               with) the justification of the law, and then received baptism, from which He gave the
               New Testament as in a symbol; He endured the temptation of <persName>Satan</persName> and bore upon
               Himself the toil of journeys and the offering of prayers with great devotion; and, to
               shorten my speech, He performed all the work of the Gospel with much labour and
               sweating, showed much patience with His enemies, and finally drew nigh unto death by
               crucifixion, through which He abolished death by His resurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers omitted all these and said: And was born of <persName>Mary</persName> and crucified in
               the days of <persName>Pontius Pilate</persName>, because the beginning of His Economy for us is one thing
               and its end is another, and they included between both headings, one after another,
               all those things that the Book of the Gospel taught us. He was born of the Virgin
               <persName>Mary</persName> as a man, according to the law of human nature,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n165"/> 
               and was made of a woman.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n166"/>
               Indeed the Apostle said thus: <quote>God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under
               the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption
               of sons.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n167"/> In saying that He was made of a woman He showed that He entered into
               the world from a woman according to <pb n="68"/> the law of the children of men, and the fact
               that <quote>He was under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might
               receive the adoption of sons,</quote> happened so that He might pay our debt to the Lawgiver
               and procure life for us.</p>
            <p>Since He became one of us in nature it is with justice that He paid the debt of His
               human kinship; on account of His nature which was identical with ours He was bound to
               do this, and He did it. We were delivered from the yoke of bondage<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n168"/> because of the
               freedom which He gave us in His grace. The fact that He was not born of a man but was
               only fashioned by the Holy Spirit in the womb of His mother, is beyond the nature of
               the children of men, and the (Apostle said) that He was made of a woman in order to
               show us that He was fashioned from the nature of a woman and was born according to
               the law of nature; and this does not cause any injury to nature, because <persName>Eve</persName> also was
               made of <persName>Adam</persName>, and her birth is different from that of all men since she received her
               existence from a rib only, without marital intercourse. She had an identical nature
               with <persName>Adam</persName> because she received the beginning of her existence from him.</p>
            <p>In this way we should also think about Christ our Lord. It was a novel thing to have
               been fashioned from a woman without marital intercourse, by the power of the Holy
               Spirit, but He is associated with the human nature by the fact that He is from the
               nature of <persName>Mary</persName>, and it is for this that He is said also to be the seed of <persName>David</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n169"/>
               and <persName>Abraham</persName>, as in His Nature He is related to them. This is the reason why the
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: "For unto the angels hath He not put in subjection the world to
               come whereof we speak, but unto the one concerning whom the Book testifies, saying,
               'What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the Son of Man that thou visitest
               him'?"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n170"/> And again: <quote>He took not from the nature of angels but from the seed of
               <persName>Abraham</persName>.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n171"/> His words show that our Lord did not take a body from the angels, nor
               did He make the angels the head and renovator of the future creation which we are
               expecting, but the man whom He assumed from the seed of <persName>Abraham</persName> and through whom He
               performed all this ineffable Economy and whom He first raised from the dead and
               transferred to immortal and unchangeable life, Him He made the head and renovator of
               all the <pb n="69"/> creation, so that He was with justice set over the government of the new
               creation.</p>
            <p>As a man He was born of a woman according to the law of nature, and although this
               happened to Him in a novel way, in the sense that He alone, to the exclusion of the
               rest of mankind, was fashioned in the womb by the Holy Spirit without any marital
               intercourse, yet all that which He did for us He did according to the law of our
               nature, so that He grew little by little, reached full age and performed also
               carefully the requirements of the law. And because He paid our debt to the law and
               received victory from the Giver of the law on account of His having put into practice
               all the requirements of the law, He drew, with His own hand, to all His human race
               that blessing which the law had promised to all those who keep it.</p>
            <p>He was also baptised so that He might perform the Economy of the Gospel according to
               order, and in this (Economy) He died and abolished death. It was easy and not
               difficult for God to have made Him at once immortal, incorruptible and immutable as
               He became after His resurrection, but because it was not He alone whom He wished to
               make immortal and immutable, but us also who are partakers of His nature, He rightly,
               and on account of this association, did not so make the firstfruits of us all<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n172"/> in
               order that, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said, <quote>He might have the pre-eminence in all 
               things.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n173"/> In this way, because of the communion that we have with Him in this world, we
               will, with justice, be partakers with Him of the future good things. And as after He
               was born of a woman He increased little by little according to the law of humanity,
               and grew up fully,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n174"/> and was under the law and acted according to it, so also in the
               life of the Gospel He became an example as man to man.</p>
            <p>Because it was necessary that we who were born later should receive faith concerning
               the above future good things and that we should believe that our Saviour, our head
               and the cause of all of them for us, was Christ our Lord, it was imperative that He
               should also arrange as much as possible our mode of life in this world according to
               the hope of the future. It is with justice, therefore, that in this also He became
               our model.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n175"/> He was baptised so that He might give a symbol to our own baptism. In
               it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n176"/> He was freed from all the <pb n="70"/> obligations of the law. He performed also all
               the Economy of the Gospel: He chose disciples to Himself, established the teaching of
               a new law and a new doctrine, promulgated ways of acting congruous to His teaching
               and different from the teaching of the (old) law, and taught that the ways of acting
               of us who believe should be in harmony with His new teaching.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n177"/></p>
            <p>We also when we are baptised show (in ourselves) the symbol of the world<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n178"/> to come;
               we die with Him in baptism, and we rise symbolically with Him, and we endeavour to
               live according to His law in the hope of the future good things which we expect to
               share with Him at the resurrection from the dead. If Christ our Lord had immediately
               after His rising from the dead, raised also all men who had previously died, and had
               bestowed upon them new life fully and immediately, we should have been in no need of
               doing anything; as, however, He actually performed only on Himself the renewal which
               is to come and through which He rose from the dead and His body became immortal and
               His soul immutable, it became necessary that this decrepit and mortal world should
               last further in order that mankind might believe in Him and receive the hope of
               communion (with Him) and future life.</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that He paid the debt of the law, received baptism,
               and showed the new Economy of the Gospel, which is the symbol of the world to come,
               so that we also, who believed in Christ and became worthy of baptism, through which
               we received the symbol of the world to come, should live according to His
               commandments. This is the reason why the blessed Paul said: <quote>God be thanked, that ye
               were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine
               which was delivered you.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n179"/> In this he shows that through baptism we have received
               the teaching of the new Economy which is the symbol of the world to come, and as much
               as possible we strive to live according to it, while remote from all sin, and so not
               according to law. Indeed we are baptised as men who die with Him and will rise
               symbolically with Him, because <quote>so many of us as were baptised into <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ were
               baptised into His death and were buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as
               <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ was raised up from the dead in the glory of His Father, even so we
               should walk in newness of life.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n180"/> <pb n="71"/> </p>
            <p>After having received the grace of baptism we become strangers to all the observances
               of the law and we are as in another life: <quote>You are become dead to the law by the body
               of <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n181"/> He (<persName>Paul</persName>) said this because you have attained new life in the
               baptismal birth and have become part of the body of Christ our Lord; and we hope to
               have communion with Him now that we are freed from the life of this world and dead to
               the world and to the law, because the law has power in this world and we become
               strangers to all this world according to the symbol of baptism.</p>
            <p>When Christ our Lord performed all these things for us He drew nigh unto death, which
               He received by crucifixion, not a secret death, but a death that was conspicuous and
               witnessed by all because our Lord's resurrection was going to be proclaimed by the
               blessed Apostles, while the miracles wrought wonderfully by the Holy Spirit were
               sufficient for the corroboration of their testimony. His death had to be seen by all,
               as His resurrection meant the abolition of death. Indeed, He loosed the pains of
               death<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n182"/> completely by his 
               resurrection from the dead, ascended unto heaven and sat
               at the right hand<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n183"/> of God, and is 
               for us a true surety<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n184"/> by our participation in
               His resurrection. <quote>You were saved by the grace of Him who 
               raised us with Him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n185"/> and
               placed us at the right hand in heaven in order that He might show to the future
               worlds the greatness of the wealth and the sweetness of His mercy which was shed on
               us abundantly through our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n186"/></p>
            <p>And in order that we may believe in the good things which He promised to us, in spite
               of their greatness and in spite of the fact that they transcend us, He gave us the
               earnest of the future things, the firstfruits of the Holy Spirit,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n187"/> as the blessed
               <persName>Peter</persName> said: <quote>He was exalted by the right hand of God, and He confirmed the promise of
               the Holy Ghost which He had received, and shed forth this upon us abundantly, as you
               now see and hear.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n188"/> He calls <quote>the promise of the Holy Ghost</quote> the grace which was
               given for the confirmation of the future good things by the Holy Ghost. Indeed, these
               future things are confirmed in us by the power of the Holy Ghost. As the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>
               said: <quote>It is sown a natural body and it will rise a <pb n="72"/> spiritual body.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189"/> And in
               order that we may possess these future good things in a firm faith<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n190"/> without doubt,
               He gave us even in this world<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n191"/> the firstfruits of the Spirit which we received as
               the earnest, of which the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>In whom ye believed, and ye were sealed
               with that Holy Spirit (of promise) which is the earnest of our inheritance.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n192"/> And
               the Economy of the grace of Christ our Lord, for which we receive baptism, is like
               unto this.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers did well, therefore, to hand to us our faith by going to the
               firstfruits of the faith, and including in them all the necessary things in saying:
               And was born of the Virgin <persName>Mary</persName> and crucified in the days of <persName>Pontius Pilate</persName>. I
               believe, however, that my speech has exceeded the limits as the words (which express)
               the Economy of the grace of Christ have only been delivered to us (in short terms) as
               given above. In order, therefore, that you may not receive a teaching which is not
               perfect and that we may not trouble you with many words, let us, by the permission of
               God, leave off here the things which will follow what has been said, and be satisfied
               with what has already been spoken to-day, and let us praise the Father, the Son and
               the Holy Spirit now, always, and for ever and ever.—Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the sixth chapter. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="7">
            <head>Chapter VII</head>
            <p>Let us proceed now to deal with the grace of the Economy of the humanity of our Lord
               and Saviour <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ, and see what our blessed Fathers have handed down to us
               about it in the creed. This is the third day I am discoursing on this subject to your
               love, as I am anxious that you should learn it little by little and keep my words in
               your memory. Let us, therefore, begin to-day also to speak to you concerning things
               that fit the sequence of those already said.</p>
            <p>Immediately they began the words which deal with the Economy (of our Lord) our
               blessed Fathers first showed for whom was all this Economy accomplished, and said:
               Who for us children of men, to which they added: And for our salvation in order that
               the purpose of the Economy might be known. To this they added also: Came down from
               heaven, in order that they might make us understand the <pb n="73"/> boundless humility that
               was involved in His coming down to us, as if they were repeating the sentence of the
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName>: <quote>Though He was rich yet for your sakes He became poor,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n193"/> and humbled
               Himself to our wretchedness from the height of His glory and from His mighty
               greatness. And in order to show us how He came down they said: And became a man. He
               did not humble Himself here by an ordinary act of Providence nor by the gift of the
               assistance of (Divine) power that He had in the same way as He performed many other
               things, but He assumed and put on our nature in which He was,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n194"/> and in which He
               dwelt so that He might perfect it with sufferings and unite it to Him. In this they
               (our blessed Fathers) showed us the gift of His grace which they saw in the human
               race, and through which He assumed a man from us, was in Him and dwelt in Him, and
               they taught us that He endured and bore all according to human nature so that we
               might understand that He was not a man in appearance only, but that He was a real man
               who suffered all the human [passions] according to human nature.</p>
            <p>And in order not to lengthen their speech they omitted all the things which He
               gradually performed and which we may learn with accuracy from the reading of the
               Gospel, and they rightly made use of condensed words and said: And was born of the
               Virgin <persName>Mary</persName> and was crucified in the days of <persName>Pontius Pilate</persName>, and in this way they
               included all the Economy in its beginning and its end. We remember that we told your
               love that it is the habit of the Books to include all the Economy of Christ in the
               mention of the crucifixion, because death came to Him by crucifixion, and He
               abolished death by death and made manifest the new, immortal and immutable life.</p>
            <p>In this way our blessed Fathers included also all the Economy in these words, but
               were aware that especial attention had to be paid to the words said of the Passion or
               of the things that happened in the Passion, as they transcend all human intellect. In
               order that no doubt concerning the reality of the Passion might enter the mind of the
               hearers on account of the sublimity of this same Passion, and in order that they
               might not think that it took place in appearance only, they stressed their words so
               that they should be believed in the sense that He died in reality and so as to show
               that human death and all <pb n="74"/> passions were abolished by the resurrection of <persName>Jesus</persName>
               Christ. Indeed, if Christ endured death by crucifixion in order to make manifest His
               death to all and with His death His resurrection also by which death was abolished,
               it is with justice that our blessed Fathers warned us first on the subject of His
               death and then taught us concerning His resurrection.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why, after having said, And was crucified in the days of <persName>Pontius
               Pilate</persName>, they added: And was buried, in order to teach us that He did not die only in
               appearance and in an unreal way but that He actually died a natural death so that
               after His death His body was also buried according to the law of human nature. In
               this they followed also the teaching of the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>, who, when speaking to the
               Corinthians of the resurrection of the dead because of which he made mention of the
               resurrection of Christ our Lord—so that he might confirm the general resurrection
               from the resurrection of Christ— first taught about His death in saying that Christ
               died a real death, since His death once established the words concerning the
               preaching of His resurrection will be readily accepted. He said in effect: <quote>I
               delivered unto you first of all that which I also received that Christ died for our
               sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n195"/> He did not make use of
               the additional sentence<quote> and was buried</quote> to no purpose, but he made use of it to show
               that He truly died according to the law of human nature and that He duly endured
               death according to a mortal nature.</p>
            <p>In this same way, after our blessed Fathers had said, And was crucified in the days
               of <persName>Pontius Pilate</persName>, in order to show that He had died they added the sentence: And was
               buried, so as to demonstrate, according to the preaching of the Apostle, that He had
               truly died.</p>
            <p>Further, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>, after having said that He was buried and that He had
               truly died, added: <quote>He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n196"/> —and
               it was in this way that he was able to teach concerning the resurrection of Christ
               after His death and to fix the true belief in His death in the souls of the
               hearers—so also our blessed Fathers, after having said, And was buried, added: And
               rose the third day according to the Scriptures. They made <pb n="75"/> an accurate use of the
               words of the Scriptures in delivering to us the belief in the resurrection. The
               question involved in the resurrection is not an unimportant one because to those who
               do not believe it implies the danger of death and of falling away from all benefits,
               but on those who believe this same resurrection bestows confidence, and puts the seal
               on all the wonderful things accomplished in the Economy of Christ. Indeed this
               resurrection is the end of all the Economy of Christ and the principal object of all
               the reforms wrought by Him, as it is through it that death was abolished, corruption
               destroyed, passions extinguished, mutability removed, the inordinate emotions of sin
               consumed, the power of <persName>Satan</persName> overthrown, the urge of demons brought to nought and the
               affliction resulting from the law wiped out. An immortal and immutable life reigns by
               which all the above evils are abolished and destroyed, and it was through them that
               the demons entered to fight against us.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>"If the dead rise not, then is not
               Christ raised, and if Christ be not raised then our preaching is vain and your faith
               is also vain."</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n197"/> If it is not possible that the dead should rise it is evident that
               Christ also did not rise, because in His body He was of the same nature and received
               death according to the law of nature. If we believe that Christ rose it is clear and
               obvious that resurrection is a true fact, as that which is impossible would not have
               happened, even to Him, but since it happened to Him it is clear and evident that it
               is possible.</p>
            <p>We ought not, therefore, to deny resurrection as an impossible thing, but it is
               imperative for us to believe in it, because it did happen once and had its beginning
               in Christ our Lord. He who denies the general resurrection denies also the
               resurrection of Christ, because in His flesh He was part of human nature, and he who
               denies this shows that <quote>our preaching is vain and your faith is also vain.</quote> Because
               resurrection is the principal benefit of all the Economy of Christ in the flesh—since
               by it all evil things vanish and an entry is effected for all good things—He who
               denies this same resurrection makes our preaching and your faith vain. If death is
               not abolished the dominion of evil things is still standing and we do not look yet
               for good things. It is indeed plain that if the resurrection did not take place 
               death <pb n="76"/> would still be holding dominion, from which it could not have been overthrown,
               and because of this same death sin would also be in the ascendant and all evil things
               would be surrounding us, because he (<persName>Paul</persName>) said: <quote>If the dead rise not, then is not
               Christ raised, and if Christ be not raised then your faith is vain and you are yet in
               your sins.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n198"/> In this he shows that death was abolished through resurrection, and
               sin through death, as after the resurrection we become immortal and immutable, and if
               the resurrection does not take place faith is vain and death holds sway together with
               sin, and you also are still in your sins and have no hope of good things which we
               announced as coming to you through the resurrection.</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that in accordance with the words of the Apostle our
               blessed Fathers first mentioned the principal benefit of the Economy of Christ in
               saying: And rose from the dead, and then added the sentence: And ascended into
               heaven. It was necessary that after having known that He rose from the dead we should
               also know where He is after His resurrection. As the Sacred Book, after saying that
               God made <persName>Adam</persName>, added how, from what, and also in which locality He placed him to lead
               his earthly life, so also in the case of Christ our Lord who was assumed from us and
               was according to our nature, because after (our blessed Fathers) said that He rose
               from the dead they rightly added that He ascended into heaven so that we should learn
               that He moved into an immortal nature and ascended into heaven, as it was necessary
               for Him to be high above all. All the evangelists narrated to us His resurrection
               from the dead and with it they ended their respective Gospels, because they knew that
               it was sufficient for us to learn that He rose from the dead, moved to an immortal
               and immutable life and gave us the hope of participating with Him in the future good
               things. The blessed <persName>Luke</persName>, however, who is also the writer of a Gospel, added that He
               ascended into heaven<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199"/> so that we should know where He is after His resurrection.
               It is also known that he taught us this at the beginning of his teaching when he
               wrote the Acts of the Apostles,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200"/> where he further added the rest of the facts, one
               after another, as it fitted the sequence of the narration.</p>
            <p>As it is not only in His resurrection that Christ became our <pb n="77"/> firstfruits<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n201"/> but
               also in His ascension into heaven—in both of which He made us partakers of His
               grace—it is right that we should be instructed in both of them, because we do not
               expect only to rise from the dead but also to ascend into heaven, where we will be
               with Christ our Lord. In this same way the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said also that <quote>our Lord
               Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel
               and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we which are
               alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet our Lord
               in the air, and so shall we ever be with our Lord.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n202"/> In another passage he said
               also: <quote>For our conversation is in heaven from whence we look for the Saviour our Lord
               <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ who shall change our vile body that it may resemble His glorious 
               body,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n203"/> in order to show us that we shall be transferred to heaven from whence Christ our
               Lord will come and change us at the resurrection from the dead and make us like the
               form of His body and take us up to heaven so that we may ever be with Him. And again
               he said: <quote>For we know if this our earthly house were dissolved, we have a building of
               God and an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n204"/> in order to teach
               us that at the resurrection we will become immortal and dwell in heaven. And a little
               further on he said: <quote>While we are in the body, we are absent from our Lord, for we
               walk by faith and not by sight; we are confident and willing to be absent from the
               body and to be present with Christ,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n205"/> and showed that as long as we are in this
               mortal body we are as it were absent and remote from our Lord, as we are not actually
               enjoying yet the future good things since we have only received them by faith, but in
               spite of their being so we have great confidence in possessing them,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n206"/> and we are
               looking with great eagerness to the time when we will divest ourselves of this mortal
               body and cast it away from us and become immortal and immutable at the resurrection
               from the dead, and then we will be with our Lord like men who for a long time and for
               the duration of this world were absent and expecting to be present with Him.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why he said: <quote><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> which is above is <pb n="78"/> free, which is the
               mother of us all.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n207"/> He called <quote><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> which is above</quote> the abode which is in
               heaven and in which we, reborn at the resurrection, shall become immortal and
               immutable, when we shall truly enjoy perfect freedom and happiness, and when nothing
               will constrain us and no pain will affect us, but we will be in ineffable pleasures
               and in a happiness that will have no end; and we are expecting to enjoy these
               pleasures in which Christ our Lord became our firstfruits,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n208"/> (Christ) whom God the
               Word put on, and who through the close union that He had with Him became worthy of
               all this glory and gave to us also the hope of communion with Him.</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that the Sacred Book taught us that not only He rose
               from the dead but ascended also into heaven, so that we too should preach that which
               is implied by our blessed Fathers who, after having said, He rose the third day,
               added: And ascended into heaven. And they further added to their words: And sat at
               the right hand of God, in order to show first the great honour that came to the man
               who was assumed, from His union with God the Word who had put Him on, and secondly in
               order that we might understand the nature of the good things in which we shall dwell
               if we have truly communion with Him. Indeed, after the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> had said, <quote>You
               were dead in your trespasses and your sins and He quickened you with Christ,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n209"/> he
               added: <quote>Ye are saved.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n210"/> And He hath raised you up and made you sit together in
               heaven in <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n211"/> in order to show us the sublimity of the communion that
               we shall have with Him.</p>
            <p>After our Fathers wrote down this they added with justice: And He shall come again to
               judge the living and the dead, in order to inform us concerning His second coming in
               which we shall receive communion with Him while truly looking for Him coming from
               heaven to fashion us, according to the saying of the Apostle, like unto His glorious
               body.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n212"/> They added after His coming the sentence: To judge the dead and the living,
               so that with the mention of the good things done to us they should also implant fear
               into us and make us ready for the gift of the glory of all this Economy. They said,
              <quote> of the dead and the living,</quote> not that the dead shall be judged—what kind of judgment
               can there be to the dead who do not feel?—but <pb n="79"/> that at the time of His coming He
               will raise all of us born of <persName>Adam</persName>, that is all the children of men who had died, and
               will transform them into an immortal nature.</p>
            <p>Those men who will be overtaken by the general resurrection while still alive He will
               only transform, and from being mortal He will make immortal. This is the reason why
               they said, <quote>the living and the dead.</quote> Those who will be alive at that time they
               called <quote>the living," and those who had already died and passed away they called "the
               dead,</quote> in order to show us that all the children of men shall be judged and none
               shall escape scrutiny, and that when they have been judged they shall receive a
               judgment commensurate with the nature of their actions in a way that some of them
               will be rewarded and some others punished.</p>
            <p>The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said also in the Epistle to the Corinthians: <quote>We shall not all
               sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye, at
               the last trump, the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n213"/>
               By these words he shows that all of us shall not die but that all of us shall be
               changed; the dead shall rise incorruptible and immortal, and the living shall be
               changed into an immortal nature. Both acts will be accomplished in the twinkling of
               an eye. He said the sentence, <quote>we shall be changed</quote> of those who shall then be alive
               because when he wrote it he himself was alive, and thus he personified the
               living.</p>
            <p>He wrote something similar to this to the Thessalonians: <quote>We which are alive and
               remain shall not prevent them which are asleep, for the Lord Himself shall descend
               from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of
               God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and then we which are alive and remain
               shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and
               so shall we ever be with our Lord.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n214"/> He says that all these things will happen
               with the swiftness of the twinkling of an eye and that those who are alive will not
               prevent those who are dead when these go out to meet our Lord, and he shows that the
               latter will rise and the former will be changed, and both will be caught up together
               to meet our Lord.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers said these things to warn us, to inspire us with fear and to
               induce us to prepare for the future account (that we <pb n="80"/> shall give of ourselves).
               They rightly ascribed the sentence: To judge the living and the dead to the prosopon
               of the man who was assumed on our behalf so that they should show us the honour that
               came to the temple<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n215"/> of God the Word, that is to say to the man who was assumed for
               our salvation, and so that they should implant fear into us when teaching us by their
               words concerning the future judgment, which will be all the harder for us if we have
               a bad and inordinate will. It would be against our duty to minimise that man who was
               assumed on our behalf; who possesses such a great honour; who will judge the living
               and the dead because He was freed from all sin and was, on account of the honour that
               came to Him, in a position to be immune from death—as He said: <quote>I have power to lay
               my life down, and I have power to take it up again,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n216"/> in order to show that He was
               the Lord and had power to die and not to die—who received the death that came His
               way, and in the confidence that He had (with God) was able to conquer it; who granted
               immunity from death to all the human race; who was from us and from our human nature
               and was immune from death because of the greatness of His excellence and was always
               without stain by the power of the Holy Spirit, but nevertheless received upon Himself
               death and passion—an ignominious death by crucifixion—so that He should grant us to
               delight in the future pleasures, (it would indeed, I say, be against our duty to
               minimise that man) who endured all these things for us and not to remain steadfast in
               His love and not follow His commandments and value His love and affection more highly
               than anything else. We ought to show forth such feelings because of the ineffable
               benefits that through Him will accrue to us.</p>
            <p>Examine the strength of their statement from the fact that in speaking of His
               humanity, His Passion and His resurrection they affirmed that the very same prosopon
               to whom all this happened shall sit in judgment. In order, however, that no one might
               be led to believe that a mere man will be the judge of all the creation they added
               the word Again, so that they should refer (the act of judging) as by a sign to the
               Godhead of the Only Begotten who was in Him and from whom He received all that
               honour. If they did not wish to imply this it would have been sufficient to say: He
               shall come to judge the living <pb n="81"/> and the dead, but with the addition of again they
               referred to His Godhead. He who shall come openly is in truth the man who has been
               assumed from us, and it is He who shall come from heaven, and He of whom it may
               rightly be said that He moves from place to place, as it is written: <quote>This same <persName>Jesus</persName>
               which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen
               Him go into heaven.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n217"/> This was to demonstrate to them that it would be the very
               man who was seen by them, and was with them, and was now being separated from them,
               who would be coming and be seen by all men. To this man the word again is not
               fitting. Indeed, it is not He who came but it is the Godhead that came down from
               heaven, not that it moved from place to place, but by its condescension and its
               Providence for us which it manifested<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n218"/> in the man who was assumed on our behalf.
               The word again will refer in the next world to the man whom (the Godhead) assumed on
               our behalf. The man who was assumed on our behalf went now first into heaven and will
               come again first from heaven, but because they (our blessed Fathers) were referring
               in their words to the Divine nature they counted His coming twice, first when He came
               down through that man, and secondly when He will come again through the same man who
               has been assumed, because of the ineffable union that that man had with God.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>, after saying, "We look for the glorious
               appearing of the great God," added: "and the Saviour <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n219"/> He shows that
               we are looking for the Divine nature, which is higher than everything, to come and
               appear to all men, and because this Divine nature cannot be seen with material eyes,
               it will make its appearance to men according to the power of the onlookers. And he
               showed us the way in which we expect the Divine nature to appear by adding: <quote>and our
               Saviour <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ.</quote> He refers here to that corporeal man and shows clearly that it
               is in the coming and the vision of that man that the Divine nature will make its
               appearance. It is in this man by whom it had formerly saved us that it will make its
               appearance in order to grant these ineffable benefits.</p>
            <p>It is with justice, therefore, that our blessed Fathers added the word again in order
               to show us the Divine nature from which the <pb n="82"/> great honour of judging was given to
               that visible (man). It is that (Divine nature) that will judge all the world
               according to the sentence of the Apostle who said that it will judge all the earth
               through the man <persName>Jesus</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n220"/> It is clear that the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> shows us that it is God
               who will judge all the earth through that man who was assumed on our behalf and who
               rose again from the dead for the confirmation of our faith.</p>
            <p>Let what has been spoken suffice for the teaching of to-day, and let us praise God
               the Father, and the Only Begotten Son and the Holy Spirit, now, always and for ever
               and ever.</p>
            <p>Here ends the seventh chapter.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="8">
            <head>Chapter VIII</head>
            <p>In the last days we spoke gradually and sufficiently to your love of the doctrine
               concerning Christ, according to the teaching of our blessed Fathers. It behoves you
               now to remember the things spoken to you with so much care. They gave us a two-fold
               teaching concerning Christ our Lord according to the meaning of the Books, that He is
               not God alone nor man alone, but He is truly both by nature, that is to say God and
               man: God the Word who assumed, and man who was assumed. It is the one who was in the
               form of God that took upon Him the form of a servant,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n221"/> and it is not the form of a
               servant that took upon it the form of God. The one who is in the form of God is God
               by nature, who assumed the form of a servant, while the one who is in the form of a
               servant is the one who is man by nature and who was assumed for our salvation.</p>
            <p>The one who assumed is not the same as the one who was assumed nor is the one who was
               assumed the same as the one who assumed, but the one who assumed is God while the one
               who was assumed is a man. The one who assumed is by nature that which God the Father
               is by nature, as He is God with God, and He is that which the one with whom He was,
               is, while the one who was assumed is by nature that which <persName>David</persName> and <persName>Abraham</persName>, whose
               son and from whose seed He is, are by nature. This is the reason why He is both Lord
               and Son of <persName>David</persName>: Son of <persName>David</persName> because of His nature, and Lord because of the honour
               that came to Him. And He is high above <persName>David</persName> His father because of the nature that
               assumed Him. <pb n="83"/> </p>
            <p>This is the reason why when our Lord asked the Pharisees:<quote> Whose son was the Christ?</quote>
               and they answered: <quote>The son of <persName>David</persName>,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n222"/> He did not disapprove of the answer given.
               It is the same evangelist <persName>Matthew</persName>, in whose account is the fact that the Pharisees
               were asked this question by our Lord, who wrote also at the beginning of his Gospel:
               "The beginning of the Gospel of <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ the son of <persName>David</persName>, the son of 
               <persName>Abraham</persName>."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n223"/> He would not have 
               taught this at the beginning of his Gospel had he known that
               our Lord did not approve of it; indeed he who took so much trouble to write
               faithfully his Gospel according to the orders of Christ would not have dared to put
               down in writing a statement that was detrimental to Christ. It is indeed evident that
               our Lord did not disapprove of that which was said to the effect that Christ was the
               son of <persName>David</persName>, in the sense that it was not well and rightly said, the reason being
               that all the Pharisees and the Jews were expecting Christ to come as a simple man
               from the seed of <persName>David</persName>. In this they were in harmony with the words of the prophets,
               and were not aware that the one who assumed the other who is from the seed of <persName>David</persName>,
               was the Only Begotton of God, who dwelt in Him and through Him performed all the
               Economy of our salvation, and united Him to Himself and made Him higher than all the
               creation.</p>
            <p>It is because the Pharisees were not aware of all this that our Lord asked them:
             <quote>Whose son was the Christ?</quote>; and after they answered what they knew to the effect
               that He was the son of <persName>David</persName>, He said to them: <quote>How then doth <persName>David</persName> in spirit call
               Him Lord, saying: <quote>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand till I make
               Thine enemies Thy footstool?</quote> If <persName>David</persName> then call Him Lord, how is He his son?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n224"/> In
               these words He gave them, by a hint only and not openly, the doctrine concerning the
               Godhead. At that time they transcended the intelligence of the Jews so much so that
               even the blessed Disciples were not aware of their meaning before the crucifixion.
               <quote>If ye had known me ye should have known my Father also.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n225"/> And again: <quote>Have I been
               so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, <persName>Philip</persName>?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n226"/> And again: <quote>"These
               things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I shall no more
               speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall <pb n="84"/> shew you plainly of the Father."</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n227"/> And
               again: <quote>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n228"/> And again: <quote>I have yet many
               things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; howbeit when the Spirit of truth
               is come, He will guide you into all truth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n229"/></p>
            <p>One finds in the Book of the Gospel many passages which demonstrate that the Apostles
               were not aware of the Divinity of the Only Begotten before the Crucifixion, nor were
               they aware that God the Word was the Son of the Father and a true Son of God, whom we
               understand to be consubstantial with His Father. He knew that it was not yet time to
               promulgate openly this doctrine of His Godhead, but in His question He only gave a
               hint that they would not possess a complete knowledge about Christ as long as they
               believed that He was only a man and did not understand the Divine nature which was in
               Him and because of which the one who was from the seed of <persName>David</persName> became worthy of the
               honour of being Lord. <persName>David</persName>, from whose seed He was by nature, would not have called
               him His Lord if he did not believe that the one who was of the same nature as himself
               was something higher and better than the nature of men, and one who by His union with
               the Lord was elevated to such a great honour that He was believed to be Lord. He is,
               therefore, of the same nature as <persName>David</persName> because He is of his seed, but we understand
               Him to be also Lord because of the union that He had with the Divine nature which is
               the cause and the Lord of all.</p>
            <p>We ought, therefore, to know the natures of both, the one who assumed and the one who
               was assumed, and realise that the former is God and the latter is the form of a
               servant, and that it is God who dwells and man is His temple which He built and
               constituted as His dwelling. This is the reason why He said: <quote>Destroy this temple and
               in three days I will raise it up,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n230"/> which the evangelist interpreted and said:
               <quote>For He spake of the temple of His body.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n231"/> He called the man who was assumed His
               temple while showing that He Himself was dwelling in that temple, and through His
               dwelling He clearly showed us His power when He delivered it (His dwelling) to the
               destruction of death, according to His desire, and then raised it by the greatness of
               His might; and so that it might die He allowed it to suffer according to its nature
               while He, as Lord, impeded it from seeing <pb n="85"/> corruption<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n232"/> and from being delivered
               to dissolution. He allowed it to die because He wished it, and after its death, He
               raised it up according to His will.</p>
            <p>He would not have said, "Destroy this temple" had He not known that He had the power
               (to say so), and since He is Lord He implied two things in the sentence <quote>Destroy this
               temple</quote>: although it is in its nature to be destroyed yet I have it in My power that
               this should happen or not. I will allow it to be destroyed according to its nature,
               and if I do not wish it I have the power to impede it from being destroyed. <quote>Destroy
               this temple, </quote>because it is impossible that I myself should be destroyed, as My
               nature is undestroyable, but I will allow this (temple) to be destroyed because such
               a thing is inherent in its nature; I would not have allowed this to happen to it had
               I not intended to do a higher thing to it; I am allowing this (to happen) to it
               because I am prepared to do another thing:</p>
            <p>What is the meaning of the sentence <quote>"and in three days I will raise it up"</quote>? (It
               means) that when it has been destroyed I will build it up again and will raise it up
               at the resurrection from the dead in a state higher and better than the first; it
               will not be then mortal and destroyable in its nature as it is now, but immortal,
               indissoluble, impassible, and immutable; it is in this way that I will raise it up to
               a much higher state than that in which it is at present by nature; I will allow it to
               be destroyed in order that I may do something higher to it. Destroy, therefore, this
               temple; fulfil your wish; make use of your artifice; I will allow you to do what you
               wish so that after you have done it you should feel my power which is higher than
               all, as it is by it that I will raise it up from the dead and make it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n233"/> into
               something higher than it is now. You will then realise that you would not even have
               been in a position to destroy it if I had not willed it, and that it would not have
               died if I had not permitted it; since I will it, however, it will be good to it:
               <quote>destroy, therefore, this temple and m three days I will raise it up.</quote></p>
            <p>In these words He showed sufficiently the difference between Him and the one who was
               destroyable, because the latter was the temple and the former its dweller; the latter
               His dwelling as a temple, and the former its dweller as a God; not a temple for a
               short time only <pb n="86"/> and not one in which God the Word sometimes dwelt and sometimes
               not, but a temple from which it will never be separated, as it possesses an ineffable
               union with the one who is dwelling in it. He made Him perfect through His sufferings,
               as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n234"/> and He received these sufferings according to His nature
               while He was in need of the One who was to deliver him from passion, the One who
               changed His nature and made Him impassible and crowned Him with sufferings. As to
               Himself He dwelt in Him, and He is by nature impassible, and has the power to make
               Him impassible also although (by nature) passible. In this way He perfected through
               sufferings and made immortal and immutable in everything the form of a servant<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n235"/>
               which was assumed as His temple, that is to say the man who was assumed for our
               salvation.</p>
            <p>The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>For unto the angels hath He not put in subjection the world
               to come whereof we speak, but unto the one about whom the Book testifies, <quote>What is
               man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him? Thou
               madest him a little lower than the angels, Thou crownedst him with glory and honour,
               and didst set him over the works of Thy hands and Thou hast put all things in
               subjection under his feet.</quote></quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n236"/> After having shown that He did not take on Him the
               nature of angels but of man,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n237"/> he explained to us who was this man and said: <quote>We see
               <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of His
               death crowned with glory and honour </quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n238"/> in order to show that this man <persName>Jesus</persName>, who
               was assumed for our salvation, became a little lower than the angels because He
               tasted death, and that honour and glory are also placed on His head because He rose
               from the dead and through His union with God became higher than all creation.</p>
            <p>And in order to teach us why He suffered and became <quote>a little lower</quote> he said: <quote>Apart
               from God He tasted death for every man.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n239"/> <pb n="87"/> In this he shows that Divine nature
               willed that He should taste death for the benefit of every man, and also that the
               Godhead was separated from the one who was suffering in the trial of death, because
               it was impossible for Him to taste the trial of death if (the Godhead) were not
               cautiously remote from Him,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n240"/> but also near enough to do the needful and necessary
               things for the nature that was assumed by it. It was necessary for the one through
               whom and for whom everything was (done) to perfect with sufferings the source<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n241"/> of
               the life of the many children whom he<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n242"/> 
               brought to His<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n243"/> glory. He<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n244"/> Himself
               was not tried with the trial of death but He was near to him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n245"/> and doing to him the
               things that were congruous to His nature as the Maker who is the cause of everything,
               i.e. He brought him to perfection through sufferings and made him for ever immortal,
               impassible, incorruptible, and immutable for the salvation of the multitudes who
               would be receiving communion with him.</p>
            <p>In this way the Sacred Books teach us the difference between the two natures, and so
               it is indispensable for us to ascertain who is the one who assumed and the one who
               was assumed. The one who assumed is the Divine nature that does<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n246"/> everything for
               us, and the other is the human nature which was assumed on behalf of all of us by the
               One who is the cause of everything, and is united to it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n247"/> in an ineffable union
               which will never be separated. This is the reason why on account of our association
               with it the gift which we are expecting to receive will also remain truly with us.
               The Sacred Books also teach us this union, not only when they impart to us the
               knowledge of each nature but also when they affirm that what is due to one is also
               due to the other, so that we should understand the wonderfulness and the sublimity of
               the union that took place (between <pb n="88"/> them). As such is the statement: <quote>Of whom as
               concerning the flesh Christ (came), who is God over all.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n248"/> It is not the one who
               is of the Jews in the flesh who is by nature God over all, nor the one who by nature
               is God over all is also by nature from the Jews, but in his sentence the Apostle
               showed us the two natures. In saying, <quote>of whom is Christ concerning the flesh</quote> he
               alluded to His humanity, and in saying, <quote>who is God over all</quote> he taught us concerning
               the nature of His divinity; and he referred his teaching to one only by saying, <quote>of
               whom Christ concerning the flesh, who is God over all.</quote></p>
            <p>As such also are the words uttered by our Lord in the Gospel: <quote>If ye shall see the
               Son of man ascend up where He was before.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n249"/> Lo, it is known that the Son of man
               who was a man by His nature was not in heaven before, but ascended up because of the
               Divine nature which was in Him, and which was in heaven. When He said also of His
               body that it can give immortal life to those who eat it,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n250"/> because the words that He
               uttered were not believed by the hearers, He endeavoured to convince them from the
               fact that although His words were incredible at the present time they will be
               credible later, as if He were saying to them: When you see that I have become
               immortal and have ascended up to heaven you will believe that you will partake of the
               things that will happen to me because of your association with me in those things, as
               the Divine nature which dwells in me and which was before in heaven will grant
               immortality to this one<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n251"/> and will take Him up to heaven and will grant you also
               communion with Him. He (Christ) uttered these words as of one in order to demonstrate
               the close union that took place:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n252"/> If ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where He
               was before—If this were not as we said He was bound to say: If ye shall see the Son
               of man ascend up where the One who is in Him was,—you will understand the greatness
               of the Divine nature which is dwelling in Me and you will be astonished at the
               wonderfulness of the things that will happen to Me, and because of Me to you
               also.</p>
            <p>As such also is the meaning of the sentence: <quote>And no man hath ascended up to heaven,
               but He that came down from heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n253"/> He did not
               say that no man hath <pb n="89"/> ascended up to heaven, and I ascended up because of the
               Divine nature which dwells in Me and which is even now in heaven, but He referred His
               words jointly to one: <quote>no man hath ascended up to heaven but He that came down from
               heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven.</quote> He did not wish to say separately that no
               man ascended up to heaven but the Son of man who was dwelling in Him and who came
               down and was in heaven. He did not approve of this method of speaking and uttered His
               sentence in a way that it refers to one individual, and this in order to demonstrate
               and confirm the wonderful things done to the one<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n254"/> who was visible.</p>
            <p>Any time the Book wishes to speak of the things done to the human nature, it rightly
               refers them to the Divine nature because they are high above our nature; in this it
               shows the union (of the Divine nature) with that man in order to make credible the
               things done to Him: it shows also that it is through the wonderful Divine nature
               which was united to Him that He became worthy of all this honour and glory, and it
               assures us that these same things will in the future be done to us. Indeed that man
               would not have been the possessor of such great benefits if He had no union with God,
               nor would we be hoping for all the future good things if the Divine nature that put
               on the form of a servant had not wished to grant to Him all those good things and
               extended their delight to us.</p>
            <p>Because of all this let us learn the distinction between the natures and their union
               from the Holy Scripture and let us hold steadfast to this doctrine and understand the
               difference between these natures: that the one who assumed was God and the Only
               Begotten Son, while the one who was assumed was the form of a servant, which is man;
               that God assumed (man) for the benefit of our human race, and that (man) was assumed
               so that He<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n255"/> should remain in virtues and bestow on us the communion of His grace.
               We should also be mindful of that inseparable union through which that form of man
               can never and under no circumstances be separated from the Divine nature which put it
               on. The distinction between the natures does not annul the close union nor does the
               close union destroy the distinction between the natures, but the natures remain in
               their respective existence while separated, and the union remains intact, because the
               one who <pb n="90"/> was assumed is united in honour and glory with the one who assumed
               according to the will of the one who assumed Him.</p>
            <p>From the fact that we say two natures we are not constrained to say two Lords nor two
               sons; this would be extreme folly.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n256"/> All things that in one respect are two and in
               another respect one, their union through which they are one does not annul the
               distinction between the natures, and the distinction between the natures impedes them
               from being one. So in the sentence: <quote>I and my Father are one</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n257"/> the word <quote>one</quote> does
               not annul the fact of "I and my Father," who are two. In another passage He said
               about the husband and wife that "they are no more twain but one flesh."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n258"/> The fact
               that the husband and wife are one flesh does not impede them from being two. Indeed
               they will remain two because they are two, but they are one because they are also one
               and not two. In this same way here (in the Incarnation) they are two by nature and
               one by union: two by nature, because there is a great difference between the natures,
               and one by union because the adoration offered to the one who has been assumed is not
               differentiated from that to the one who assumed Him, as the former is the temple from
               which it is not possible for the one who dwells in it to depart.</p>
            <p>All things said of two take the qualification of two when one of them is not
               differentiated by the object through which it receives the number two; as such is the
               sentence of the Scripture in which mention is made of four beasts: a lion, a bear, a
               leopard and another more dreadful.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n259"/> The Book said <quote>four</quote> because each one of them
               is a beast in its nature. As such also is the sentence: <quote>The testimony of two men is
               true,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n260"/> because each one of them is by nature that which the other is. Likewise in
               the sentence: <quote>No man can serve two masters</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n261"/> because any man who serves <persName>mammon</persName>
               with the same care as he serves God has both as masters.</p>
            <p>Here<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n262"/> also if each of them was Son and Lord by nature it would be possible for us
               to say two Sons and two Lords, according to the number of the 
               persons,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n263"/> but one<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n264"/>
               being Son and Lord by nature and <pb n="91"/> the other<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n265"/> being neither Son nor Lord by
               nature, we believe that the latter received these (attributes) through His close
               union with the Only Begotten God the Word, and so we hold that there is one Son only;
               and we understand that the one who is truly Son and Lord is the one who possesses
               these (attributes) by nature, and we add in our thought the temple in which He dwells
               and in which He will always and inseparably remain on account of the inseparable
               union which He has with Him and because of which we believe that He is both Son and
               Lord.</p>
            <p>In any other passage in which the Book calls the one who was assumed <quote>Son,</quote> it will
               be seen that He is called Son because of the close union that He had with the one who
               assumed Him. When it says: <quote>Concerning His Son who was made of the seed of <persName>David</persName>
               according to the flesh,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n266"/> it is evident that it calls here Son the one who was
               made of the seed of <persName>David</persName> in the flesh and not God the Word but the form of the
               servant which was assumed. Indeed it is not God who became flesh nor was it God who
               was made of the seed of <persName>David</persName> but the man who was assumed for us, and it is Him that
               the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> clearly called Son.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n267"/> We understand Him to be Son and we call Him
               so; not for Himself<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n268"/> but because 
               of the union that He had with the true Son.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n269"/> It
               is in this sense that our Lord taught His disciples when He said: <quote>Go ye and teach
               all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
               Holy Ghost.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n270"/></p>
            <p>This teaching we uphold in this way: as we call the Father Divine nature, and the
               Holy Ghost Divine nature from God the Father,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n271"/> so we call the Son the Divine nature
               of the Only Begotten, as in the case of the Father and of the Spirit, but to our
               knowledge concerning the Godhead we add the man who was assumed and through whom we
               received our knowledge of the Divine nature of which is the one who assumed Him, who
               is God the Word, and also His Father <pb n="92"/> and of the Holy Ghost. It is written: <quote>The
               Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth these works</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n272"/> and of the Holy Spirit it is
               written that it descended like a dove and dwelled in Him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n273"/> Indeed as the Father
               cannot be separated from the Son nor the Son from the Father—<quote>I am in my Father and
               my Father is in me</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n274"/>—so also the Father cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit.
               The Scripture says: <quote>For what man knoweth the things of a man save the Spirit of man
               which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n275"/>
               in order to show us that the Holy Spirit is always and without separation with God
               the Father in the same way as our soul is never separated from us as long as we live
               and are human beings. He was, therefore, Son by necessity in that form of a servant
               which was assumed, and the Father was with the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>If He said concerning all men: <quote>He that loveth me keepeth my commandments, and I will
               love him and will manifest myself to him,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n276"/> and: <quote>I and my Father will come unto
               him and make our abode with him,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n277"/> why should you wonder if in the Lord Christ
               according to the flesh dwelleth the Father together with the Son and the Holy Spirit?
               Inasmuch as when we say ' Father, Son and Holy Spirit,' we name the Godhead<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n278"/> in
               which we ought to be initiated to religion and be baptised, so also when we say <quote>Son</quote>
               we refer to the Divine nature of the Only Begotten while rightly including also in
               our thought the man who was assumed on our behalf and in whom God the Word was made
               known and preached and is now in Him, while the Father and the Holy Spirit are not
               remote from Him, because Trinity is not separable, consisting as it does of one,
               incorporeal and uncircumscribed nature. We learned these things from the Sacred
               Books, and we ought to think and to believe accordingly.</p>
            <p>Since the measure of things said suffices let us add here to our discourse glory to
               God the Father, to the Only Begotten Son, and to the Holy Spirit, for ever and
               ever.—Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the eighth chapter. <pb n="93"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="9">
            <head>Chapter IX</head>
            <p>You have heard from what has been spoken to you how our blessed Fathers instructed us
               successively and according to the teaching of the Sacred Books concerning the Father
               and the Son without neglecting the Economy of our Lord and Saviour <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ. Let
               us now bring forth what is written after this. The question will deal now with the
               Holy Spirit, and our blessed Fathers who assembled from all parts in the town of
               <placeName>Nicea</placeName> for the sake of that wonderful Council wrote about Him simply and without
               amplification by saying: And in the Holy Spirit. They thought that this would be
               sufficient for the ears of that period. Those who after them handed to us a complete
               doctrine concerning the Holy Spirit were the Western Bishops who by themselves
               assembled in a Synod, as they were unable to come to the East on account of the
               persecution that the Arians inflicted on this country. And later, when Divine grace
               put an end to the persecution, the Eastern Bishops gladly accepted the doctrine
               handed down by (the Bishops of) that Western Synod, concurred in their decision, and
               by subscribing to what they had said, showed their adhesion to them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n279"/> If one looks
               deeply into the matter, however, one will find that they derived their reason for the
               complementary addition that they made later in their teaching concerning the Holy
               Spirit from the blessed Fathers who had assembled from the whole world in the first
               Council held in the town of <placeName>Nicea</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The reason why our blessed Fathers did not hand down to us in a complete form all
               things that were said later concerning the Holy Spirit is clear and evident, and it
               is that at that time had risen the unholy <persName>Arius</persName> who was the first to blaspheme
               against the Son of God, and assert wickedly that the Only Begotten Son of God, and
               God the Word, was created and made from nothing. Because of this our <pb n="94"/> blessed
               Fathers rightly assembled and held a wonderful Council. The time was propitious for
               their gathering because the God-loving and the blessed <persName>Constantine</persName> urged them to it
               in order to destroy the wickedness of the heretics and to confirm the faith of the
               Church. This is the reason why they made use in their doctrine concerning the Son of
               clear statements and copious words for the destruction of the heresy of <persName>Arius</persName> and the
               confirmation of the true faith of the Church of God. They did not do the same in the
               case of the Holy Spirit because at that time no question had yet been raised
               concerning Him by the heretics. They thought that for a complete belief in the true
               faith it would be sufficient to insert in their creed the name of the Spirit in its
               right place according to the teaching of our Lord, and to teach all men that in the
               Creed and in the profession of faith it ought to be pronounced with that of the
               Father and of the Son. It is not possible for any one to have faith<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n280"/> if he does
               not name, profess, and believe in, the Holy Spirit together with the Father and the
               Son.</p>
            <p>This is the meaning of their words in saying: And in the Holy Spirit. Men who did not
               include (in their words) any created being would not have inserted the Holy Spirit
               with so much care in their faith and in their creed side by side with the Father and
               the Son had they not wished to separate in this same creed all the created beings
               from the uncreated nature. It was thus necessary that the Spirit should be named and
               professed side by side with the Father and the Son, because He also is from the
               uncreated nature, existing from eternity, and cause of everything, to which adoration
               is due to the exclusion of all created beings. That this is so our profession of
               faith testifies; indeed faith is not professed in a created nature but in a Divine
               and uncreated nature; nor did our blessed Fathers discover and write a new doctrine
               from their own head but they clearly followed the teaching of our Lord who taught His
               disciples, saying: <quote>Go ye and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the
               Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n281"/></p>
            <p>It is clear and evident that He made His disciples the teachers of all the world and
               ordered them to convert all men from the error of polytheism to which they were
               formerly clinging—by ascribing the name of God to creatures and giving honour to
               natures which did not <pb n="95"/> deserve honour—and to teach them to offer true worship only
               to the Divine nature which is eternal, not made, and the cause of everything. He did
               not order them to convert all nations from the error of worshipping those who are not
               gods by nature in order to bring them to the discipleship of one who is not God by
               nature, but He did order them to preach, instead of those who were wrongly called
               gods, the nature which is not made, is eternal and the cause of everything, and to
               which is rightly due the name of Lord and God because it is Lord and God by nature.
               The knowledge of religion consists in this faith, and it is (this faith) that is the
               cause of all good things.</p>
            <p>It is in this name that we are baptised and expect that the communion of the
               ineffable Divine benefits will accrue to us through baptism. We would not have named
               at baptism a being that was not the cause of the benefits that we are expecting to
               possess. We name (Him) because we know that He has the power to grant us the heavenly
               and imperishable benefits in the hope of which we receive the gift of baptism. In the
               same way as (the Book) said: <quote>In the name of <persName>Jesus</persName> of <placeName>Nazareth</placeName> rise up and walk</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n282"/>
               and showed that it was Christ who was the cause of the cure of the lame man, in this
               same way where it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n283"/> ordered: <quote>Baptise in the name of the Father, and of the Son and
               of the Holy Ghost</quote> it clearly showed that these names which are pronounced at baptism
               are the cause of all the benefits which we are expecting to possess. It is not to no
               purpose that it says: <quote>in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy
               Ghost,</quote> but in order that from their names we may derive our hope of enjoying the
               future good things.</p>
            <p>As such also is the sentence uttered by the prophet: <quote>Beside Thee we know no other
               Lord. We are called by Thy name.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n284"/> (The prophet) shows here that they did not
               recognise nor did they name another Lord beside the one who is truly Lord. And again:
               <quote>Because of Thy name we shall tread down our enemies,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n285"/> and: <quote>In Thy name our horn
               shall be exalted,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n286"/> in order to show that they prevailed against their enemies
               through His name. In another passage he said: <quote>I will call on the name of the 
               Lord,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n287"/> that is to say, I have believed 
               that He is the Lord and also the cause of all <pb n="96"/>
               good things to me. (Our Lord) said here also: <quote>In the name of the Father, and of the
               Son, and of the Holy Ghost</quote> in order that His disciples might learn from Him that all
               the nations were looking for this name as the cause of all their good things, because
               the nature which is called <quote>Father, and Son and Holy Ghost,</quote> and in which we are
               baptised, is truly the Lord who is able to give us the heavenly good things which we
               are expecting and in the hope of which we draw nigh unto the grace of baptism.</p>
            <p>As He ordered us to name the Father in the act of our disciple-ship and our baptism,
               because He is the Divine nature which is eternal and cause of everything and because
               He is able to vouchsafe unto us the benefits involved in the promise of baptism; and
               as He ordered us to name the Son because He has an identical nature and is able to
               vouchsafe unto us the same benefits, it is likewise evident that He named the Holy
               Spirit side by side with the Father and the Son for this very reason, that is to say
               because He is of the same nature as that which is eternal and cause of everything, to
               which is truly due the name of Lord and God. If in this creed He had wished to refer
               to a nature which was created and to another which was uncreated, we must admit that
               He neglected to name myriads of other created natures, that is to say, everything! A
               man with a sound mind will not think of such a thing.</p>
            <p>It is clear that our Lord was handing down to us the doctrine of the Divine knowledge
               and teaching us the religious name which was congruous to the Divine nature in which
               we were to be baptised and which was able to vouchsafe unto us the future good
               things. We are thus ordered not to look for another name as the cause of the future
               good things except to that of the Divine nature which is eternal and cause of
               everything. It is, therefore, evident that He would not have named the Spirit side by
               side with the Father if they were not one Divine nature which was eternal and cause
               of everything, to which the name of Lord and God was truly due, and by the grace of
               which we shall also participate in the future good things.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers also meant this when they said: And in the Holy Spirit. They said
               this so that they might be understood by others that they were following the teaching
               of our Lord and so that they might intimate to every one that they also named the
               Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son according to our Lord's doctrine, <pb n="97"/> because
               He also is, like the Son, of the same Divine nature of the Father, and we ought to
               believe in Him and to worship Him as the cause of the future good things. They left
               their statement in the above simple sentence without any amplification because no
               question had yet been raised by the heretics against the Holy Spirit; and they
               thought that the addition <quote>Holy</quote> placed after the name of the Spirit, according to
               the teaching of our Lord, was sufficient as a perfect doctrine for those by whom
               truth is honoured.</p>
            <p>To men of good will the sentence used by our blessed Fathers according to the
               teaching of our Lord was indeed adequate, because they could not have taught us how
               to believe in things concerning a man in our profession of faith concerning God. They
               who taught clearly concerning the Son of God to the effect that we ought to believe
               in Him as consubstantial with God, would not have added in their profession of faith
               a word concerning the Holy Spirit had they not known that He also was of the same
               Divine nature of God the Father. The mere<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n288"/> mention of the name "Holy Spirit" was
               sufficient to demonstrate His nature as taught to us by the Divine Book, which indeed
               would not have called Him by this exclusive name if He was not of Divine nature.
               Actually there are many things referred to by the word <quote>spirit</quote> in the Holy
               Scripture: the angels are called by it: <quote>He made his angels a spirit,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n289"/> and also
               our soul: <quote>His spirit goeth out and he returneth to his earth,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n290"/> and likewise the
               winds: <quote>He causeth the spirits to blow and they cause waters to flow.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n291"/> Similarly
               all things which have a subtile nature in comparison with the visible objects, which
               our senses cannot accurately comprehend and which are not clearly defined, we call
               spirits.</p>
            <p>Although numerous are the things which in common parlance are called spirits, yet
               this word <quote>spirit</quote> refers in an exclusive way, as the Holy Scripture teaches us, to
               the Godhead,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n292"/> which is incorporeal and can never be circumscribed. Holy Writ bears
               witness to the fact that it is called and is truly a spirit. This is the reason why
               our Lord said to the Samaritan woman who had believed that God was worshipped in a
               special place, and was contending against the Jews and asking <pb n="98"/> whether the place
               which was fit for worship was <placeName>Mount Gerizim</placeName> or <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>: "God is a spirit, and they
               that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n293"/> What He showed here
               amounted to this: all of you are in great error in believing that God is more in this
               or in that place. God being incorporeal and uncircumscribed is not confined to a
               place, but is in all places equally. A worship of duty and of truth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n294"/> is good and
               obligatory when man worships while believing that God is incorporeal and
               uncircumscribed, and thinks in clear conscience that God is not confined nor
               circumscribed in a place.</p>
            <p>As there are many beings who bear the name of <quote>I am</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n295"/>—as all things created from
               nothing are so called because they <quote>are</quote>— when God was asked by the blessed <persName>Moses</persName>
               about His name He answered: <quote>I am that I am. This is my name for ever, and this is my
               memorial unto all generations.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n296"/> He did not mean to say that there is nothing else
               that is <quote>I am,</quote> but that this name <quote>I am</quote> belongs prominently to Him, not that He
               once was <quote>I am</quote> and once was not, but that He was <quote>I am</quote> eternally and always. In
               this same way there are many beings who bear the name of <quote>spirits,</quote> but the word
               <quote>Spirit</quote> refers pre-eminently and is due to Divine nature which is truly incorporeal
               and uncircumscribed. If, therefore, it were possible to contend that when the
               Scripture says <quote>Holy Spirit</quote> it says it in a general sense and throws ambiguity in
               the minds of the hearers, who in hearing this very name <quote>Holy Spirit</quote> mentioned might
               think and say: <quote>What is the precise meaning conveyed by the Scripture, since this
               name is applied to all the other beings who are called spirits?</quote>—the case would be
               similar with regard to the name <quote>I am</quote> which Holy Writ applies to God because we
               would not be able to understand to whom it is precisely ascribed, as there are many
               beings who are referred to by the word "I am"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n297"/> and it is not known whether man or
               another being is implied; this general term would, therefore, be in need of an
               addition through which the one who is called by it is distinguished. <pb n="99"/> We do not,
               however, understand God in this sense, either when we call Him <quote>I am</quote> or when we call
               Him <quote>Spirit,</quote> because if we call Him <quote>I am</quote> we understand that in truth He is "I am"
               alone, and if we call Him <quote>Spirit,</quote> He is in truth <quote>Spirit</quote> alone.</p>
            <p>It is imperative now that we should discuss also the Holy Spirit and see to what kind
               of <quote>Spirit</quote> (the Book) refers when it says, <quote>In the name of the Father, and of the
               Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</quote> There is no one who is so mad as to believe that this
               passage requires discussion, because it is known that the Divine Book is wont to
               refer by this name exclusively to one whom it everywhere names side by side with the
               Father and the Son, in the same way as it named Him when baptism was handed down to
               us. While all spirits have by general usage assumed one common name (of spirit)
               because they are subtile in their nature in comparison with the visible things, which
               are in no way grasped by any of our visible senses—this name <quote>spirit</quote> is rightly said
               with pre-eminence of the Divine nature as it is truly a spirit which is incorporeal
               and uncircumscribed. Thus we have understood Divine nature to be, and the Holy Spirit
               is called and professed by this name alone side by side with the Father and the Son
               because He possesses an identical nature with them.</p>
            <p>As when we hear the name of the Father, although there are many other fathers, we
               nevertheless understand it to refer truly to one mighty God who is eternal; and as,
               although many are called sons, we, nevertheless, think only of one Son, who did not
               become, neither is He, a Son through the process of transformation—like the sons whom
               we have with us and who are born through the transformation of the (human) seed and
               are afterwards called sons—but He is truly alone Son of a Father who is eternal, and
               He is eternally from Him and with Him—, in this same way when we hear [the name of]
               the Holy Spirit we do not think of one of those beings who are called spirits but of
               the one who is truly called alone by this name and is incorporeal, uncircumscribed
               and confessed side by side with the Father and the Son in one Divine nature.</p>
            <p>The addition <quote>Holy</quote> is characterised by the same implications as the name <quote>Spirit.</quote>
               Although there are many beings that are <quote>holy,</quote> as in the sentence, <quote>When He shall
               come in the glory of His Father and of His holy angels,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n298"/> and although there are
               also <pb n="100"/> many objects called by this name of holiness, such as "The tabernacle of
               the Most High is holy,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n299"/> these are called holy by common usage only as having
               derived their holiness from God. The one who is truly holy is Divine nature. It is
               indeed said: <quote>Thou art holy and Thy name is reverend</quote>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n300"/> and even the Seraphim when
               they glorify they say in their canticle which is congruous to this Divine nature as
               follows: <quote>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole heaven and earth are full
               of His glory.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n301"/></p>
            <p>The one who is truly holy is He whose nature is immutable and unchangeable and He who
               has not received holiness from another but alone can bestow holiness on all He
               pleases. In this way the Divine Book calls Holy Spirit the one who is alone
               confessed, at baptism and in the act of discipleship, side by side with the Father
               and the Son, because this name Holy Spirit is truly due only to Divine nature. This
               is the reason why when we hear this name Holy Spirit we do not ask who is meant by
               it, because we know that He is the one who is alone (holy) by nature and who is named
               with the Father and the Son as an act due to His nature, because the nature of the
               Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is one.</p>
            <p>From this it is easily understood by men of good will that our blessed Fathers taught
               us sufficiently concerning the nature of the Holy Spirit when they placed Him on the
               same level with the Father and the Son, because in this they clearly taught us
               something that is in harmony with the words which our Lord pronounced to His
               disciples and which ascribed to Him a name congruous to Divine nature. It was deemed
               sufficient by them simply to insert this name in the profession of faith which they
               taught, because by its exclusiveness it is capable of demonstrating the nature of the
               one who is named.</p>
            <p>This being the case it is only men of ill will who make show of insolence and call
               the Holy Spirit a servant or a creature, while some others amongst them although
               refraining from these words yet refuse to call Him God. It is with a sense of duty,
               therefore, that the Doctors of the Church,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n302"/> who assembled from all parts of the
               world and who were the heirs of the first blessed Fathers,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n303"/> proclaimed before all
               men the wish of their Fathers and in accurate deliberations made <pb n="101"/> manifest the
               truth of their faith and interpreted also their mind.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n304"/> They wrote to us words which
               warn the children of faith and destroy the error of the heretics. As their Fathers
               did in the profession of faith concerning the Son for the refutation of the
               ungodliness of <persName>Arius</persName>, so they did in their words concerning the Holy Spirit for the
               confutation of those who blasphemed against Him.</p>
            <p>They thought that it would be the height of folly to call creature and servant one
               who by the mention of His name frees us from death and corruption through baptism,
               and renews us according to the teaching of our Lord, because a creature is not able
               to free us nor is a servant able to renew us. It was considered by them to be folly
               to hesitate to call God one who is truly God, as it is clear that one who is neither
               a creature nor a servant is God. If He be a creature, He is also a servant, and no
               creature and no servant are truly God. To call creature or servant one by whose name
               we expect to be renewed and freed—since in calling Him by His name side by side with
               that of the Father and the Son we believe that He will grant us renewal and
               freedom—is a great error<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n305"/> and an outrageous blasphemy. Duty compels us, therefore,
               to call Him God because no other nature can create, renew and free except Divine
               nature, which is neither created nor made, but is the cause of everything, is able to
               renew its works according to its will and has the power to give us freedom as it
               wishes.</p>
            <p>Because of this and for it, it was right on the part of our blessed Fathers to
               proclaim in their creed that the Holy Spirit was Divine nature with the Father and
               the Son, and by the addition of short words to confirm the true doctrine of the
               Church which was to be made manifest to those who draw nigh unto the holy baptism:
               And in ONE Holy Spirit. What our Fathers wrote does not differ in meaning from: And
               in Holy Spirit. Although they made use of this word,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n306"/> well knowing that the Holy
               Spirit that was called by this name was one as the Divine Books had taught us, they
               nevertheless made its meaning clear by saying: And in one Holy Spirit, and thus
               brought themselves into harmony with the usage adopted by Holy Writ which in saying
               <quote>one</quote> Father and <quote>one</quote>Son says also <quote>one</quote> Holy Spirit. <pb n="102"/> </p>
            <p>This is the reason why the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said in one passage: <quote>By one Spirit we are
               all baptized into one body.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n307"/> And in another passage: <quote>One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
                  one body, one spirit, one God Father of all, who is above all and through all and in us all.</quote> 
               <ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n308"/> And again: <quote>There are diversities of gifts but the Spirit is
               one, and there are diversities of administration but the Lord is one, and there are
               diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n309"/> He
               clearly shows here that as there is one Lord, because He is the Lord and there is no
               other beside Him, and as there is one God and there is no other beside Him, so there
               is one Spirit and there is no other beside Him. The created beings are numerous and
               different in their nature, but there is only one immutable nature which is the cause
               of everything, and outside this nature there is no uncreated being who is the cause
               of the created beings, and He who is of that nature is truly uncreated and cause of
               everything.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why there is only one Father who is truly Father alone and Divine
               nature, and there is only one Son who is truly Son alone from the Divine nature of
               God, and there is only one Holy Spirit who is Holy Spirit alone and whom we have
               learnt from the sacred Books to call by this name, because He also is from that
               eternal nature and is God and cause of everything. He is also truly God and Lord
               alone because He created everything, and has power over everything, and is called and
               is truly Spirit because He is truly incorporeal and uncircumscribed, and to Him is
               due the attribute of holiness, as He is alone holy and immutable by nature, and as it
               is He who bestows holiness upon those He pleases and frees them from inclination
               towards evil.</p>
            <p>All the created beings are not holy by nature but are receivers of holiness from the
               one who is the cause of their being. It is with justice, therefore, that when the
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName> exhorted the Ephesians to unity and to be of one mind, made mention of
               this nature by which they were to be of one mind: <quote>Endeavour to keep the unity of the
               Spirit in the bond of peace,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n310"/> and as you were born of one Spirit in order to be
               one in your motherly bond<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n311"/> so you ought to be united and <pb n="103"/> joined one to
               another. In amplifying his sentence he said: <quote>one body and one Spirit even as ye are
               called in one hope of your calling,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n312"/> because as you were born of one spirit you
               have become one body of Christ who is the head:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n313"/> the man who was assumed so that
               through Him we might have relationship with Divine nature, as we are expecting to
               have communion with Him in the next world, because we believe that our vile body
               shall be changed and fashioned like unto His glorious body.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n314"/> We have been called to
               the hope of these (benefits), and we were born of baptism by the power of the Holy
               Spirit; and as a symbol and earnest of the future things we received the firstfruits
               of the Spirit,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n315"/> through whom we were reborn and by whom we obtained the gift of
               being one body of Christ.</p>
            <p>In expanding further his sentence the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>One Lord, one faith, one
               baptism, one body, one Spirit, and one God the Father who is above all and through
               all and in us all.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n316"/> One is the Spirit of whom you were born, in the same way as
               one is the Lord and one is God whom we believe to be our Lord and our Maker and whom
               by the grace of baptism we have been worthy to call Father. One faith and one
               baptism: because although we say Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we only profess one
               nature of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in which we are initiated
               to our faith and which we have agreed to name at baptism. It is evident that he would
               not have said one faith if he did not know that the names of the Father, of the Son,
               and of the Holy Spirit through whom disciple-ship is effected were one nature; nor
               would he have said one baptism had he not been aware that those names which are
               pronounced at baptism had only one power, one will and one act through which the
               grace of our second birth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n317"/> was accomplished.</p>
            <p>The addition of the word one has, therefore, taught us sufficiently and accurately
               the Divine nature of the Holy Spirit. He is one as the Father is one and as the Son
               is one, and we believe that the (nature) of each one of them is identical, because
               the Divine nature, which is uncreated, eternal, and cause of everything, is one. It
               is known that the created beings are numerous and possess various and <pb n="104"/> different
               natures according to the wish of their Maker, and are bound to be always dependent 
               on<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n318"/> that nature which is uncreated and the cause of everything.</p>
            <p>Things that have now been spoken will suffice us for to-day, and we will leave off
               the rest for another day if God wishes. Let us, therefore, put an end here to our
               discourse and praise God the Father, the Only Begotten Son, and the Holy Spirit, now,
               always, and for ever and ever. Amen. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the ninth chapter. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="10">
            <head>Chapter X</head>
            <p>I know that you remember what we spoke to your love concerning the Holy Spirit, when
               we showed the greatness of His glory from the fact that in the initiation<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n319"/> of
               baptism He is believed in side by side with the Father and the Son. We adduced
               another reason which is no less cogent than this from the fact that He is alone
               called exclusively Holy Spirit, a name which in the teaching of the Books is simply
               ascribed to Divine nature; and also from the fact that He is called one Spirit like
               one Son, one God and one Lord. To those who have goodwill in religion the words
               written in the sacred Books would have been sufficient; these have been written also
               in the teaching of our blessed Fathers, who, however, because there are no adequate
               words easily to convince an evil mind, added of necessity to their teaching a
               statement which they chose in order to warn the children of the faith and refute the
               error of the heretics. They inserted, therefore, in their doctrine words that
               resemble those said of the Son. In speaking of the Son it was sufficient for those
               who do not refuse to be convinced to state that the one who was called an Only
               Begotten Son was truly a Son consubstantial with His Father, but on account of the
               wicked men who are bent on perversion they added: Born of Him before all the worlds,
               and not made, true God of true God, consubstantial with His Father, and in this they
               made <pb n="105"/> clear to all the meaning of the name <quote>Only Begotten</quote> in order to confirm
               the faithful and rebuke the haters of truth.</p>
            <p>In this same way they inserted here also a word which gives us the true meaning of
               the name which is handed down to us by the Divine Books concerning the Spirit, who at
               the time of our initiation and baptism is confessed side by side with the Father and
               the Son. For people of goodwill in religion a word which would show that the Holy
               Spirit was of the Divine nature of God the Father would have been sufficient, but on
               account of people inclined to insolence<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n320"/> and steadfast in it and in blasphemy, our
               blessed Fathers were rightly advised, even after all this credible teaching, to
               corroborate the doctrine of faith by means of a short addition, for the benefit of
               all and especially for your benefit, you who are on the point of drawing nigh unto
               the gift of the Spirit. They, therefore, said: And in ONE Holy Spirit. They did not
               invent this expression but took it from the teaching of our Lord, who, speaking to
               all His disciples before His passion wished to instruct them on the kind of
               resurrection from the dead which He will grant to mankind, and said that He will
               bestow upon them the grace of the Holy Spirit from which is derived the happiness of
               the future good things, which are so wonderful and have such a permanent effect on
               those who are worthy to receive them.</p>
            <p>He rightly instructed us in His teaching on the greatness and glory of the Holy
               Spirit, and by this He showed us the greatness of the grace which was to be given to
               the faithful, so that we should firmly believe in the wonderful benefits which from
               it would be granted to us and would never be taken from us. He said thus: <quote>If ye love
               me, keep My commandments, and I will pray the Father, and He shall send you another
               Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n321"/> He showed them in these words:
               You should persevere in keeping My commandments, never to deviate from them in any
               way, and since you will not be receiving a casual and ordinary thing only, you will
               have to show great care and diligence: you will be receivers of no less a gift than
               the grace of the Holy Spirit, which will be always with you and bestow heavenly gifts
               upon you. And in corroboration of what had been said He added something that shows
               the honour due to the Holy Spirit, and said: <quote>The Spirit of 
               Truth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n322"/> Indeed, it is <pb n="106"/> the 
               nature of the Spirit to give everything in truth without any change, and
               because He is eternal, immutable and unchangeable in His nature He is able to bestow
               upon others the delight of heavenly gifts which will not perish nor suffer any
               change.</p>
            <p>(The Book) calls falsehood a perishable thing that is not permanent, and truth an
               imperishable thing that is permanent. Because the one who affirms a thing which does
               not exist lies, and the one who affirms a thing which exists tells the truth, it (the
               Book) calls falsehood a thing which does not last because it becomes like a thing
               which does not exist, while it calls truth a thing which lasts and exists
               permanently. This is the reason why the blessed <persName>David</persName> said: <quote>I said in my haste, All
               men are liars,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n323"/> that is to say because I became proud and thought highly of
               myself I suddenly fell into dire calamities and was in danger, as if I was nothing,
               and was about to perish, if Thy wonderful help had not assisted me; I was astonished
               at the great number of calamities that assailed me and understood that it was falsely
               that I had thought highly of myself; I found by experience that human things are
               nothing and that in truth they are all false: wealth, power, might, and all things
               which are considered by men to be great and wonderful. All these things, nay, even
               the fact of our existence are also false, because we make show of this fact of our
               existence to deceive those who see us, while eventually we are cut off by death and
               reminded that we are nothing, and all the great things that we are supposed to
               possess leave us at the end of our life.</p>
            <p>As (the Book) calls falsehood a thing that has no enduring effect so it calls truth a
               thing that is lasting and does not perish, as it is said, <quote>Mercy and truth will meet
               us</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n324"/> to show us that He (God) will truly grant us mercy. He is, therefore, called
               God of truth because He is truly able to give us all. It is said: <quote>Thou hast saved us
               O Lord God of truth,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n325"/> that is to say, Thou hast saved us from the calamities that
               are known to us because Thou alone art able to grant benefits that are lasting and
               imperishable to whomsoever Thou wishest. The blessed <persName>David</persName> said these things of God
               and called Him God of truth in order to show that He is truly able to grant
               everything.</p>
            <p>Our Lord also said similar things of the Holy Spirit in order to confirm the truth of
               the future good things that will be granted to us <pb n="107"/> in the next world by the same
               Holy Spirit. It is as if He had said: The Holy Spirit, the gift of whose grace you
               will receive, is one who gives heavenly and imperishable benefits to all He pleases,
               and because He is eternal in His nature and immutable and unchangeable, the things
               which He will give will also last for ever and will not change or perish. It is not
               possible that the one who grants benefits which are unchangeable and imperishable
               should not Himself be eternal and imperishable in His nature, and such a one is
               indeed Divine nature which is eternal. In created things there is nothing that can
               last by itself; the one who may be so constituted is so through another; indeed, how
               can a created being have by himself the attribute of permanency unless this be given
               to him by his Maker? The one, however, who is eternal, because immutable in His
               nature, is able to grant imperishable benefits to others as He pleases.</p>
            <p>In short, Christ our Lord gave us a great testimony about the nature of the Spirit,
               in saying, <quote>The Spirit of Truth.</quote> This expression cannot in any way fit the created
               beings because they are very far from being able to give any lasting thing to others,
               as they themselves are in need of their Maker to remain in the state in which they
               had once been created. And He fittingly added: <quote>Whom the world cannot receive because
               it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n326"/> There is no reason to wonder that the
               Holy Spirit is so in His nature and in His power, as in His nature He is higher than
               all creation and there is no created being that can see Him and receive Him in His
               nature or understand Him, if He Himself does not reveal His knowledge to mankind by
               His will. This is the reason why He added: <quote>But you know Him for He is with you and
               dwelleth in you,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n327"/> and you rightly receive His knowledge because you have received
               from Him the gift of grace, which will remain with you for ever for the confirmation
               of the pleasures of the future good things in which you will be immortal and
               immutable.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers inserted this expression concerning the Holy Spirit as they had
               received it from our Lord, and added another: Who proceeds from the Father. This is
               also found in the teaching of our Lord to His disciples: <quote>When the Spirit Paraclete
               is come, whom I will send unto you, even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from
               the Father, He will testify of me.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n328"/> Here also He <pb n="108"/> revealed in advance the
               gift of the grace of the Holy Spirit which was to be bestowed upon all the disciples
               after His ascension. In saying: <quote>When the Paraclete is come, whom I will send unto
               you</quote> He refers to the grace of the Spirit which He was about to bestow on them. He
               was not going to send unto them the Divine nature of the Spirit which was everywhere,
               but He said this of the gift of the grace which was poured upon them and in which He
               called also the Paraclete the <quote>Comforter,</quote> because He was able to impart unto them
               the knowledge which was required of them for comforting their souls in the numerous
               trials of this world.</p>
            <p>After having spoken of the gift of the grace of the Holy Spirit He began to speak of
               His nature and of the greatness of the honour due to Him, in order to show the
               character of the grace which they were going to receive, and said: <quote>The Spirit of
               Truth.</quote> This expression denotes the greatness of His nature and His power to grant
               imperishable benefits to all He pleases. Then He added the sentence that <quote>He proceeds
               from the Father</quote> to signify that He is always with God the Father and inseparable
               from Him. This has also been said by the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>: <quote>What man knoweth the things
               of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth
               no man but the Spirit who is from God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n329"/> He meant by this that as the spirit of
               man is not separated from him as long as he is and remains a man, so also the Holy
               Spirit is not separated from God the Father because He is from Him and from His
               nature, and is always known and confessed side by side with Him To this our Lord
               referred as by a hint when He said: <quote>He proceeds from the Father,</quote> because the Holy
               Spirit is a spring which is always with God and has never been separated from Him. He
               has not been created later but He is eternally in Him, and He is from the nature of
               God the Father, and eternal; and like a river with undiminishing flow, He bestows His
               gifts upon whom He pleases.</p>
            <p>In this way He said also in another passage: <quote>He that believeth on Me, as the
               Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n330"/> and the
               blessed evangelist interpreting this expression said: "This spake He of the Spirit,
               which they that believe on Him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet,
               because that <persName>Jesus</persName> was not yet glorified."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n331"/> He 
               explains here clearly that He was <pb n="109"/> speaking of the gift of the Spirit. 
               He did not speak of the person<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n332"/> or of the
               nature of the Holy Spirit that they were not yet, when he said that <persName>Jesus</persName> was not yet
               glorified, because He was eternally before all creation, but He said it of the gift
               of the Holy Spirit which after the ascension of our Lord into heaven was poured and
               seen on the blessed Apostles and on those who were with them. He said that the gift
               of the Holy Spirit will be poured on those who will believe in Him, like an
               undiminishing flow of water, because it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n333"/> will be given by God the Spirit, who thus
               makes manifest His work of giving eternal life to those who believe in Him.</p>
            <p>He who says that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father shows that He is eternally
               with God the Father and is not separated from Him, because He is always and eternally
               in Him. Indeed if gifts proceed from the Holy Spirit like a river, and if this Spirit
               proceeds from God the Father, it is clear that He is eternally from Him and with Him
               and He did not come into existence later. As when the Book says that <quote>a river
               proceeded from<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n334"/> <placeName>Eden</placeName> to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became
               into four heads,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n335"/> we rightly understand that the source which made these rivers
               to flow from <placeName>Eden</placeName> was not parted for the reason that it was from thence that it had
               to flow, so also when our Lord says in parable of the Holy Spirit that He proceeds
               from the Father, He gives us to understand that the Holy Spirit is not separated from
               Him, but He is eternally from Him, in Him and with Him, and like an undiminishing
               river He distributes gifts to all creatures according to the measure of the faith of
               His receivers, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>There are diversities of Gifts but the
               Spirit is one,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n336"/> and also <quote>the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man
               to profit withal.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n337"/></p>
            <p>In explaining this expression of our Lord our blessed Fathers said that He proceeds
               from the nature of the Father, that He proceeds from Him eternally, and that He was
               always in the Father and did not come into existence later. It is evident that he who
               is eternally from the Father and with Him, proceeds also from His nature, because it
               is impossible that anything should be with God which is not by nature from Him. <pb n="110"/> </p>
            <p>After this they added in their teaching concerning the Spirit: Giver of Life,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n338"/> an
               expression which aptly demonstrates that the Holy Spirit is God like the 
               expressions<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n339"/> discussed above. Our Lord said: <quote>The water that I shall give shall be in him a
               well of water springing up into everlasting life.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n340"/> He refers by His words to the
               gift of the Holy Spirit which gives everlasting life to those who are worthy of it.
               And again in another passage: <quote>He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said,
               out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n341"/> He calls living water the
               gift of the Holy Spirit because it can grant everlasting life. And the Apostle also
               said: <quote>The letter killeth but the Spirit giveth life</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n342"/> and showed us that He will
               make us immortal. And again in another passage: <quote>The first <persName>Adam</persName> was made a living
               soul and the second Adam a quickening Spirit.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n343"/> He shows by his words that Christ
               our Lord was changed in His body, at the resurrection from the dead, to immortality
               by the power of the Holy Spirit. He likewise said in another passage: <quote>He was
               declared to be the Son of God with power and by the Spirit of holiness, and rose up
               from the dead, <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ our Lord.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n344"/> And: <quote>If the Spirit of Him that raised up
               our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ from
               the dead shall also quicken your dead bodies because of His Spirit that dwelleth in
               you.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n345"/></p>
            <p>Our Lord also said when teaching us concerning His body: <quote>It is the Spirit that
               quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n346"/> in order to show that He also had
               immortality from the Holy Spirit and to demonstrate this point to others. Such an act
               belongs indeed to the nature that is eternal and cause of everything, because to Him
               who is able to create something from nothing belongs the act of giving life, that is
               to say, to make us immortal so that we should always live. Even among created beings
               those who have an immortal nature are considered higher in rank, and it is,
               therefore, clear and evident that he who is able to perform this act<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n347"/> is also able
               to perform other acts. God Himself shows that it is the prerogative of the Divine
               nature to <pb n="111"/> do this in saying: <quote>Know now that I am He and there is no God beside
               Me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n348"/> He shows that it is His
               exclusive prerogative to raise from the dead and to free from their pain those who
               are wounded.</p>
            <p>It is with the (above) words that our blessed Fathers warned us and taught us that we
               ought to believe that the Holy Spirit was from the Divine nature of God the Father.
               This is the reason why He is confessed and believed in side by side with the Father
               and the Son at the time of initiation and baptism. Each one of us is baptised in the
               name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, according to the doctrine
               of our Fathers, which is derived from the teaching of our Lord, so that it should be
               made clear and manifest to all that our blessed Fathers handed down to us the
               doctrine of the true faith by following the order of Christ. Even the words of the
               creed contain nothing but an explanation and interpretation of the words found in the
               teaching of our Lord. Indeed, He who ordered to baptise the Gentiles in the name of
               the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit showed us clearly that the Divine
               nature of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is one. It was not
               possible that He should induce the Gentiles—who were converted to the true faith by
               casting away from them the error of polytheism and rejecting those who were falsely
               called gods—to receive a teaching that drew them nigh unto the Father, the Son and
               the Holy Spirit, if He did not know the oneness of their Divine nature which exists
               eternally and which is the cause of everything; (nor would He have induced us) to
               secede from those who are not truly gods and to believe in one Divine nature which is
               Father, Son and Holy Spirit; to desist from calling creatures gods and to believe
               that the uncreated nature is one, which from nothing can make everything because it
               is truly Lord and God to whom this name and this honour are justly due.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why our Lord caused baptism to follow catechumenate<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n349"/> so that
               baptism should be the end of catechumenate. It was necessary for those who had
               rejected false gods and learnt that Divine nature was one, eternal and cause of
               everything, which is <pb n="112"/> Father, Son and Holy Spirit, to receive through these names
               the gift of baptism which is bestowed for the sake of a wonderful happiness and is
               the earnest of the future and ineffable benefits. Faith is professed at baptism by
               the mention of these names, because those who mention them<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n350"/> designate one Divine
               nature which is eternal, cause of everything, and able to create all things from
               nothing while always caring and providing for them. We also rightly expect to be
               renewed and to receive the freedom of truth through these names of Father, Son and
               Holy Spirit which are pronounced at baptism.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the profession of faith in baptism they (our blessed Fathers) added
               the profession of faith in: One Catholic Church. (It is as if the catechumen says): I
               shall be baptised in order to be a member of the great body of the Church, as the
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>One body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of
               your calling.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n351"/> He does not call Church the building made with hands, even if we
               suppose that it has been so called because of the congregation of the faithful who
               are in it, but he calls Church all the congregation of the faithful who worship God
               in the right way and those who after the coming of Christ believed in Him from all
               countries till the end of the world and the second coming of our Saviour from heaven,
               which we are expecting. When our Lord also said to His blessed disciples: <quote>Go ye and
               teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of
               the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you,</quote> He added:
              <quote> Lo, I am with you in all days even unto the end of the world.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n352"/> He said the words
               <quote>with you</quote> in the person of the Apostles to all who will believe in Him in every
               country, and who will be baptised according to this teaching till the end of the
               world.</p>
            <p>This congregation of the faithful and God-fearing men our Lord called also Church
               when He said: <quote>Thou art <persName>Peter</persName>, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the
               gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n353"/> He promised to assemble together all
               God-fearing men to this faith and to this creed, and their gathering will not perish
               nor be prevailed against, in their fight with the enemies. Upon this the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>
               said: <quote>To the intent that unto the principalities and powers in heaven might be known
               by the Church the depth of the wisdom <pb n="113"/> of God, which He purposed in Christ <persName>Jesus</persName>
               our Lord before the worlds.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n354"/> He shows here that in this manifold wisdom of God
               the invisible powers were astonished that He assembled together all men to the
               worship of God, and made them as one body of Christ at the second birth from the holy
               baptism, and prepared them to hope that they will participate with Him in the future
               good things of the next world. He calls this Church the body of Christ because it
               received communion with Him through the regeneration of baptism, symbolically in this
               world but truly and effectively in the next, when <quote>our vile body shall be changed,
               that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n355"/> As we are in this world
               like unto the body of <persName>Adam</persName> and we resemble him also in our body, so we shall be
               called the body of Christ our Lord, because when our vile body is changed we shall
               receive the glory of His body.</p>
            <p>The blessed <persName>Paul</persName> shows this in another passage: "I rejoice in my sufferings for you,
               and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His
               body's sake, which is His church, whereof I am made a minister."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n356"/> He clearly calls
               the Church the body of Christ, for the maintenance of which he became a minister, and
               because of this he endured and suffered much; and he shows also that all the faithful
               became one body through one power of the Holy Spirit because they were called to one
               future hope. This is the reason why in writing to the Corinthians he said: "You are
               the body of Christ our Lord."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n357"/> Our Lord also said by way of prayer in His words to
               His disciples: "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them which shall believe on
               Me through their word, that they all may be one as Thou Father art in Me, and I in
               Thee, that they also may be one in Us,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n358"/> i.e. I desire that not only these but all
               those who shall believe in me through them, be one in the change (which they will
               undergo for the possession) of the future benefits; as I have with Thee a close and
               ineffable union so let them also be one in their faith in Us, through the perfection
               of their change (for the possession) of those benefits, and be like unto My glory and
               possess union with Me, by means of which they will gradually move to the honour of
               relationship with the Divine nature.</p>
            <p>We symbolise this state in baptism, since we die with Christ in baptism and rise
               again according to the testimony of the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n359"/> <pb n="114"/> This is the reason why
               each one of us declares: <quote>I will believe and be baptised in the name of the Father,
               and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit through one holy Catholic Church.</quote> (The
               catachumen) shows by his words: I am not preparing for baptism for the sake of little
               things but for the sake of great and wonderful things and heavenly benefits, as I am
               expecting that through baptism I shall be made a member of the Church, which is the
               congregation of the faithful, who through baptism became worthy to be called the body
               of Christ our Lord and received an ineffable holiness and the hope of the future
               immortality and immutability. And it is one Church, which embraces all, on account of
               those who believe in all countries and expect to receive heavenly life, as the
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said: <quote>The heavenly Church in which are written the firstborn of 
               God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n360"/> He called them <quote>The firstborn</quote> because they will receive the wonderful adoption
               of sons<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n361"/> in a primary predestination, not like that of the Jews which was of a
               changing character, but an ineffable immortality and immutability in good, which is
               granted to those who are worthy of it. He called them also <quote>written in heaven,</quote>
               because it is there that they will dwell.</p>
            <p>They called the Church <quote>holy</quote> because of the holiness and the immutability which it
               will receive from the Holy Spirit, and <quote>Catholic</quote> in order to refer to all those who
               believed in all countries and at all times, and <quote>one</quote> because only those who believed
               in Christ will receive the future good things, and it is they who are <quote>one holy
               Church.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n362"/></p>
            <p>In order to show the utility that accrues from this profession of faith they (our
               blessed Fathers) said: For the remission of sins. In these words they did not mean a
               simple remission of sin but its complete abolition. Our Lord said also: <quote>This is My
               body which is broken on behalf of many for remission of sins,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363"/> 
               that is to say all <pb n="115"/> sins will be wiped off, because a true remission consists in the remission not
               of some sins but of all of them, as the blessed <persName>John</persName> said: <quote>Behold the lamb of God,
               which taketh away the sin of the world.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n364"/> This, however, will take place fully in
               the next world when after the resurrection we shall be immortal and immutable and
               when all the impulses of sins will cease. This is the reason why the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>
               also said: <quote>If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised, and if Christ be not
               raised your faith is vain and ye are yet in your sins.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n365"/> He shows in this that in
               the future resurrection from the dead we are expecting complete abolition of sin.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers, therefore, after having said, Remission of sins, added: For the
               resurrection of the flesh and life everlasting. They show here that we shall receive
               these when we shall have risen from the dead and received the happiness of the
               everlasting good things, and then after we have become truly immutable, the complete
               abolition of sin will take place, and we shall become one, holy and Catholic Church,
               as we shall receive an ineffable holiness and become immortal and immutable and be
               worthy to be always with Christ: <quote>When this corruptible shall have put on
               incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to
               pass the saying that is written, 'Death is swallowed up in victory. O grave, where is
               thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?' The sting of death is sin, and the
               strength of the sin is the law.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n366"/> Then will truly take place the abolition of all
               these: of death, sin and corruption, and with them the law also will be abolished
               because saints who have become immortal and incorruptible are in no need of the
               law.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Fathers did, therefore, well to give us first the profession of faith
               through which we receive our teaching according to the doctrine of our Lord, and
               understand that which we have to learn concerning the Father, the Son and the Holy
               Spirit, to the effect that the same Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one Divine
               nature, which is eternal and cause of everything, and that this nature is rightly and
               alone called Lord and God, whom we ought to confess, in whom we ought to believe and
               to whom worship is due from all created beings. After this, they taught us the
               profession of faith (which is to be made) at baptism in order to show that all this
               is in <pb n="116"/> accordance with the sequence of the teaching of our Lord who said: <quote>Go ye,
               teach and baptise in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy 
               Spirit.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n367"/> Thus they<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n368"/> 
               are taught and thus they perform the (sacrament of) baptism in the
               name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Those who are about to be baptised in the hope of ineffable benefits ought not to
               name another nature beside the one from which all benefits are bestowed on all
               created beings. This is the reason why they added to this the profession of faith
               concerning the future benefits in the hope of which we draw nigh unto the grace of
               baptism, as by necessity we have to know what kind of benefits are granted to this
               discipleship, and also that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are one Divine
               nature, and also that at the second birth from the holy baptism we receive the faith
               in the heavenly and imperishable benefits that the Divine nature, which is eternal
               and cause of everything, is able to bestow upon us.</p>
            <p>We have in many past days spoken to your love in a comprehensive way that embraces
               the explanation of all the creed. It behoves you now to remember carefully the words
               that have been spoken to you in order that by keeping without modification the creed
               of the religion of the fear of God you may truly receive the happiness of the future
               benefits, of which may God make us worthy by the grace of His Only Begotten, our Lord
               <persName>Jesus</persName> Christ, to whom and His Father, in conjunction with the Holy Spirit, be glory
               and honour, now, always and for ever and ever. Amen. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here ends the transcription of the ten chapters<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n369"/> on the exposition of the creed,
               written by the righteous and lover of Christ, <persName>Mar Theodor</persName>e, bishop and interpreter of

               θανάτου is rendered in the English Bible as follows: "That He by the grace of God
               should taste death for every man." In this translation Jesus tastes death by the
               grace of God. In the West Syrian or Monophysite Versions of the Bible we generally
               read: "Because He, God, by His grace tasted death for every man." ([Syriac]) In this
               translation it is God who tastes death. Against such an idea the East Syrian or
               Diophysite versions of the Bible read as above: "Apart from God He (Jesus) tasted
               death." In this rendering death is removed from God. The sentence played a great part
               in the Christological controveries of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries. The
               Vulgate reads: "Ut gratia Dei pro omnibus gustaret mortem." For a full discussion of
               this passage and the different readings of the ancient Greek MSS. concerning it see
               Moffatt in International Critical Commentary (Hebrews), pp. 25-28.</note>

               the guidance of Athanasius, in which the Deity of the Spirit was affirmed. See Migne,

               the Council of Constantinople in 381: "We acknowledge one baptism." This article was
               evidently lacking in the Nicene Creed. Below he refers to baptism but only in
               connection with the words pronounced by the baptizandus. There is, however, a
               reference above to the fact that after the "profession of faith in baptism they added
               the profession of faith in one Catholic Church." This sentence may possibly refer to
               the addition inserted by the Council of Constantinople.</note>
