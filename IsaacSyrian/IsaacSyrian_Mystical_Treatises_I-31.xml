            <head>The struggle or rather the danger of falling that excellent works incur</head>
            <p>It is not possible to vanquish the bad deliberations that accompany the bodily
               allurements; or rather it is hardly possible. They have been called by some a double
               weapon [directed] against us. There is no rest from them as long as there is satiety
               of bread, water and sleep, and access to the things that cause emotions by their
               accidental character. It is better to depart life than to bear shame in it. When we
               are anxious to fulfill our duties, the influence of the flesh will be extinguished
               from our limbs.</p>
            <p>It is not possible to have care for apperceptible things and to correct our personal
               affections [at the same time]. For without affectionate beseechings and constant
               bending [of the knees] it is not possible to draw [divine] compassion
               towards<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n145-2"/> when it has grown strong <pb n="146"/>us; and thus it is necessary
               to practise them constantly. Without painstaking in small things it is not possible
               to escape great evils.</p>
