            <p>On various intelligible forces of the mind in connection with the actions of
               revelations and spiritual visions</p>
            <p>Divine sight is a non-apperceptible mental revelation. Divine revelation is an
               emotion of the mind by spiritual understanding, concerning the divine being. It is
               not even a faculty of the nature of the angels to be stirred into emotion at will,
               without a revelation granted by [divine] grace. Emotion by revelations concerning
               God's activity is different from emotion by revelations concerning the nature of His
               being. The former is of a nature to have analogy with apperceptible things. The
               latter has absolutely no analogy with the intellect or anything. It is threefold
               purity as to its parts and its nature, as it is said. And it is impossible that one
               of the thousand righteous should be deemed worthy of this high apperception. Also
               speculation concerning the incarnation of our Lord and His revelation in the flesh is
               said to belong to divine speculation.</p>
            <pb n="110"/>
            <p>The true sight of the angels is emotion by spiritual understanding concerning their
               domain. But it is impossible for us <pb type="external" n="162"/>to see the nature of
               spiritual forces without the mind.</p>
            <p>When man is deemed worthy of seeing them in their nature and in their place and as
               they are in their spiritual creation, grace moves his mind by the revelation of
               spiritual insight concerning them. When the soul has been purified and is worthy of
               seeing its fellows, their sight is[#n110-1] perceived with these eyes. They are not
               objects and they cannot be seen as they are, without alteration, but by psychic sight
               which is true contemplation. This means: without deterioration of their nature by
               sight. This sight cannot be acquired by any man without the second purification of
               the mind[g].</p>
            <p>But the fact that the angels appear unto some men in images, is not due to true
               sight; but the angels minister unto the order of government by their mission. Or they
               show themselves for the consolation and encouragement of the simple, [in forms]
               perceptible by sight.</p>
            <p>Such visions even happen to those who are not pure. But the first kind happens to
               illuminated and initiated people, who, by the glorious course of solitude, have been
               elevated unto the rank of purity.</p>
