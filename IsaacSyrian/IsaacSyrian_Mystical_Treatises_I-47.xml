            <head>XLVII</head>
            <head>On the angelic emotions stirring in us by divine providence for the education of the
               soul in spiritual things</head>
            <p>The first emotion that befalls a man by divine grace and draws the soul towards life,
               strikes the heart [with thought] <pb type="external" n="336"/>concerning the
               transitory character of this<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n225-1"/> nature. This thought is naturally connected
               with contempt of the world. And then begin all the beautiful emotions which educate
               unto life. That divine power which accompanies man makes as it were a foundation in
               him, which desires to reveal life in him. As to this emotion which I mentioned, if a
               man does not extinguish it by clinging to the things of this world and to idle
               intercourse, and if he makes this emotion increase in his soul by perpetual
               concentration and by gazing at himself, he will bring himself near to that which no
               tongue is able to tell.</p>
            <p>This thought is greatly hated by <persName>Satan</persName> and he strives with all his power to eradicate
               it from man. And if he were able to give him the kingdom of the whole earth in order
               to efface by thought of it from his mind this deliberation, he would not do
               otherwise. For <persName>Satan</persName> knows that if this recollection remains with him, his mind will
               no longer stay in this world of error, and his means will not reach man.</p>
            <p>This sight is clad with fiery emotions and he that has caught it will no longer
               contemplate the world nor remain with the body.</p>
            <p>Verily, my beloved, if God should grant this veracious sight unto the children of man
               for a short time, the course of the world would stand still. It is a bond before
               which nature cannot stand upright. And he unto whom this intercourse with his soul is
               given — verily, it is a gift from God, stronger than all <pb type="external" n="337"
               />partial workings, which in this middle state are presented unto those who with an
               upright heart desire repentance. It is especially given to him of whom God knows that
               he is worthy of the real transition from this world unto profitable life, because He
               finds good will in him. It will increase and remain <pb n="226"/>with a man through
               his dwelling alone by himself. Let us ask this gift in prayer; and for the sake of
               this gift let us make long vigils. And as it is a gift without equal, let us keep
               watch with tears at the gate of our Lord, that He may give it us. Further we need not
               weary ourselves with the trouble of this world. This is the beginning of the impulse
               of life, which will fully bring about in a man the perfection of righteousness.</p>
            <p>On the second working upon man. When a man follows his discipline perfectly and when
               he has succeeded in rising above the degree of repentance, and when he is near to
               taste the contemplation of his service, when it is given him from above to taste the
               delight of spiritual knowledge, a second working, after the first, will take its
               origin here.</p>
            <p>In the first place man is assured concerning God's care for him and illuminated
               concerning His love of the creatures — rational creatures — and His manifold care for
               the things which regard them. Then there arises in him that sweetness of God and the
               flame of His love which burns in the heart and kindles all the affections of body and
               of soul. And this power he will perceive in all the species<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n230-1"/> of the creation
               and all things which he meets. From time to time he will become <pb type="external"
                  n="338"/>drunk by it as by wine; his limbs will relax, his mind will stand still
               and his heart will follow God as a captive. And so he will be, as I have said, like a
               man drunk by wine. And according as his inner senses are strengthened, so this sight
               will be strengthened and according as he is careful about discipline and watchfulness
               and applies himself to recitation and prayer, so the power of sight will be founded
               and bound in him.</p>
            <p>In truth, my brethren, he that reaches this from time to time, will not remember that
               he is clad with a body, nor will he know that he is in the world. This is the
               beginning of spiritual sight in a man, and this is the principle of all intellectual
               revelations. By this the intellect will be educated unto hidden things and become
               mature, and by this he will be gradually elevated unto other things which are higher
               than human nature. In short, by this will be conducted unto man all divine visions
               and spiritual revelations which the saints<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n230-1"/> litt.: natures <pb n="227"
               />receive in this world. Thus nature can become acquainted with the gift of
               revelations that happen in this life.</p>
            <p>This is the root of our apperception in our Creator. Blessed is he that has preserved
               this good seed when it fell in his soul, and has made it to increase, without
               destroying it by idle things and by the distraction of that which is transitory.</p>
