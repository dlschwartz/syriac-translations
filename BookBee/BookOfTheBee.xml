        <p>Trusting in the power of <persName>our Lord Jesus Christ</persName>, we begin to write this book of
            gleanings called <quote>The Bee,</quote> which was composed by the saint of God, <persName>Mâr Solomon</persName>,
            metropolitan of <placeName>Pĕrath-Maishân</placeName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1-1"/> that is <placeName>Bassorah</placeName> (<placeName>al-Baṣrah</placeName>), one of His
            companions. O Lord, in Thy mercy help me. Amen.</p>
        <div type="section">
            <head>First, the Apology</head>
            <p><quote>The children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the parents for the
                spiritual children,</quote> saith the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1-2"/> therefore we are bound to
                repay thee the debt of love, O beloved brother and staff of our old age, saint of
                God, <persName>Mâr Narses</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1-3"/> bishop of <placeName>Khônî-Shâbôr Bêth-Wâziḳ</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1-4"/> We remember
                thy solicitude for us, and thy zeal for our service, which thou didst fulfil with
                fervent love and Christ-like humility. And when we had loving meetings with each
                other from time to time, thou wert wont to ask questions and to make enquiries about
                the various things which God hath wrought in His dispensation in this material
                world, and also as to the things that He is about to do in the world of light. But
                since we were afflicted with the Mosaic defect of hesitancy of speech<pb
                    type="external" n="4"/>, we were unable to inform thee fully concerning the
                    profit<pb n="2"/>able matters about which, as was right, thou didst enquire; and
                for this reason we were prevented from profitable discourse upon the holy Books.
                Since, then, God has willed and ruled our separation from each other, and the sign
                of old age, which is the messenger of death, hath appeared in us, and we have grown
                old and come into years, it has seemed good to us, with the reed for a tongue and
                with ink for lips, to inform thee briefly concerning God’s dispensation in the two
                worlds. And, behold, we have gleaned and collected and gathered together chapters
                and sections relating to this whole universe from the garden of the divine Books and
                from the crumbs of the Fathers and the Doctors, having laid down as the foundation
                of our building the beginning of the creation of this world, and concluding with the
                consummation of the world to come. We have called this book the <quote>Book of the Bee,</quote>
                because we have gathered of the blossoms of the two Testaments and of the flowers of
                the holy Books, and have placed them therein for thy benefit. As the common bee with
                gauzy wings flies about, and flutters over and lights upon flowers of various
                colours, and upon blossoms of divers odours, selecting and gathering from all of
                them the materials which are useful for the construction of her handiwork; and
                having first of all collected the materials from the flowers, carries them upon her
                thighs, and bringing them to her dwelling, lays a foundation for her building with a
                base of wax; then gathering in her mouth some of the heavenly dew which is upon the
                blossoms of spring, brings it and blows it into these cells; and weaves the comb and
                honey for the use of men and her own nourishment: <pb type="external" n="5"/>in like
                manner have we, the infirm, hewn the stones of corporeal words from the rocks of the
                Scriptures which are in the Old Testament, and have laid them down as a foundation
                for the edifice of the spiritual law. And as the bee carries the waxen substance
                upon her thighs because of its insipidity and tastelessness, and brings the honey in
                her mouth because of its sweetness and value; so also have we laid down the
                corporeal law by way of substratum and foundation, and the spiritual law for a roof
                and ceiling to the edifice of the spiritual tower. And as the expert gardener and
                orchard-keeper goes round among the gardens, and seeking out the finest sorts of
                fruits takes from them slips and shoots, and plants them in his own field; so also
                have we gone into the garden of the divine Books, and have culled therefrom <pb
                    n="3"/>branches and shoots, and have planted them in the ground of this book for
                thy consolation and benefit. When thou, O brother, art recreating thyself among
                these plants, those which appear and which thou dost consider to be insipid and
                tasteless, leave for thy companions, for they may be more suitable to others (than
                to thee); but, upon those which are sweet, and which sweeten the palate of thy
                understanding, do thou feed and satisfy thy hunger. If, however, owing to their
                fewness, they do not fill thee, seek in succession for their roots, and from thence
                shall thy want be satisfied. Know also, O brother, that where there is true love,
                there is no fear;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3-1"/> and where there is freedom of speech, there is no dread;
                and we should not dare to be so rash as to <pb type="external" n="6"/>enter upon
                these subjects, which are beyond the capacity of our simple understanding, unless we
                relied upon thy immaculate love; because, in the words of one of the
                inspired,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3-2"/> <quote>When thou findest honey, eat (only) so much as is sufficient for
                thee, lest, when thou art sated, thou vomit it</quote>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3-3"/> that is to say, do not
                enquire (too closely) into the divine words.</p>

            <pb type="external" n="10"/>
            <p>It is well for us to take the materials for our discourse from the divine Scriptures,
                that we may not stray from the straight paths of the way of truth. The blessed
                <persName>David</persName> saith, <quote>Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations, before
                the mountains were conceived.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6-2"/> <persName>David</persName>, the harpist of the Spirit, makes
                known thereby, that although there was a beginning of the framing of <persName>Adam</persName> and the
                other creatures when they were made, yet in the mind of God it had no beginning;
                that it might not be thought that God has a new thought in respect of anything that
                is renewed day by day, or that the construction of Creation was newly planned in the
                mind of God: but everything that He has created and is about to create, even the
                marvellous construction of the world to come, has been planned from everlasting in
                the immutable mind of God. As the natural child in the womb of his mother knows not
                her who bears him, nor is conscious of his father, who, after God, is the cause of
                his formation; so also <persName>Adam</persName>, being in the mind of the Creator, knew Him not. And
                when he was created, and recognised himself as being created, he remained with this
                knowledge six hours only,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6-3"/> and there came over him a change, from knowledge to
                    <pb n="7"/>ignorance and from good to evil. Hence, when Divine Providence wished
                to create the world, the framing of <persName>Adam</persName> was first designed and conceived in the
                mind of God, and then that of the (other) creatures; as <persName>David</persName> saith, <quote>Before the
                mountains were conceived.</quote> Consequently, <persName>Adam</persName> is older than the (other) creatures
                in respect of his conception, and the (other) creatures are older than <persName>Adam</persName> in
                respect of their birth <pb type="external" n="11"/>and their being made. And whereas
                God created all creatures in silence and by a word, He brought forth <persName>Adam</persName> out of
                His thoughts, and formed him with His holy hands, and breathed the breath of life
                into him from His Spirit, and <persName>Adam</persName> became a living soul,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7-1"/> and God gave him
                the knowledge of the difference between good and evil. When he perceived his
                Creator, then was God formed and conceived within the mind of man; and man became a
                temple to God his maker, as it is written, <quote>Know ye not that ye are the temple of
                God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7-2"/> And again, <quote>I will dwell in
                them, and walk in them.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7-3"/></p>

            <p>When God in His mercy wished to make known all His power and His wisdom, in the
                beginning, on the evening of the first day, which is Sunday, He created seven

                hear a sound, He did well to create them in silence, that He might not make anything
                uselessly; but He willed, and heaven, earth, water, air, fire, and the angels and
                darkness, came into being from nothing.</p>

            <p>The earth was tôh wĕ-bôh,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7-6"/> that is to say, it was unarranged and unadorned, but
                plunged in the midst of the waters. The waters were <pb n="8"/>above it, and above
                the waters was air, and above the air was fire. The earth is by nature cold and dry.
                Dry land appeared on the third day, <pb type="external" n="12"/>when the trees and
                plants were created; and the waters were separated therefrom on the second day, when
                the firmament was made from them. Water is by nature cold and moist. As touching the
                <quote>Spirit which was brooding upon the face of the waters,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8-1"/> some men have
                ignorantly imagined it to have been the Holy Spirit,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8-2"/> while others have more
                correctly thought it to have been this air (of ours). Air is by nature hot and
                moist. Fire was operating in the upper ether, above the atmosphere; it possessed
                heat only, and was without luminosity until the fourth day, when the luminaries were
                created: we shall mention it in the chapter on the luminaries (chap. x). Fire is by
                nature hot and dry.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8-3"/></p>

            <p>Heaven is like a roof to the material world, and will serve as the floor of the new
                world. It is by nature shining and glorious, and is the dwelling-place of the
                invisible hosts. When God spread out this firmament, He brought up above it a third
                part of the waters, and above these is the heaven of light and of the luminaries.

            <head>Of the Angels<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9-2"/><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9-3"/></head>
            <p>The Angels consist of nine classes and three orders, upper, middle and lower. The <pb
                    type="external" n="13"/>upper order is composed of Cherubim, Seraphim, and
                Thrones: these are called <quote>priests</quote> (kumrê), and <quote>chief priests</quote> and <quote>bearers of
                God’s throne.</quote> The middle order is composed of Lords, Powers and Rulers:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9-4"/>
                these are called <quote>priests</quote> (kâhnê), because they receive revelations from those
                above them. The lower order consists of Principalities, Archangels and Angels: and
                these are the ministers who wait upon created things. The Cherubim are an
                intellectual motion<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9-5"/> which bears the throne of the holy Trinity, and is the
                chief of all motions; they are ever watchful of the classes of themselves and those
                beneath them. As concerning the epithet <quote>full of eyes,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9-6"/> which is applied to
                them, the eyes indicate the mystery of the revelations of the Trinity. Their head,
                and the foremost and highest among them, is <persName>Gabriel</persName>, who is the mediator between
                God and His creation. The Seraphim are a fiery motion, which warms those below it
                with the fire of the divine love. The six wings which each of them is said to
                possess<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9-7"/> indicate the revelations which they receive from the Creator and
                transmit to mankind. The Thrones are a fixed motion, which is not shaken by the
                trials which come upon it. The Lords are a motion which is entrusted with the
                government of the motions beneath it; and it is that which prevents the demons from
                injuring created things. The Powers are a mighty motion, the minister of the will of
                the Lord; and <pb n="10"/>it is that which gives victory to some rulers in battle
                and defeat to others. The Rulers are a motion which has power over the spiritual
                treasures, to distribute them to its companions according to the will of the
                Creator. This class of angels governs the luminaries, the sun, moon, and stars. <pb
                    type="external" n="14"/>The Principalities are a defined motion which possesses
                the direction of the upper ether, of rain, clouds, lightning, thunder, whirlwinds,
                tempests, winds, and other ethereal disturbances. The Archangels are a swift
                operative motion, into whose hands is entrusted the government of the wild beasts,
                cattle, winged fowl, reptiles, and everything that hath life, from the gnat to the
                elephant, except man. The Angels are a motion which has spiritual knowledge of
                everything that is on earth and in heaven. With each and every one of us is an angel
                of this group—called the guardian angel—who directs man from his conception until
                the general resurrection. The number of each one of these classes of angels is equal
                to the number of all mankind from <persName>Adam</persName> to the resurrection. Hence it is handed
                down that the number of people who are going to enter the world is equal to the
                number of all the heavenly hosts; but some say that the number is equal to that of
                one of the classes only, that they may fill the place of those of them who have
                fallen through transgressing the law; because the demons fell from three classes (of
                angels), from each class a third part. If then it is an acknowledged fact that there
                are three orders of angels, and in each order there are three classes, and in every
                class a number equivalent to that of all mankind, what is the total number of the
                angels? Some say that when the angels were created, and were arranged in six
                divisions—Cherubim, Seraphim, Thrones, Principalities, <pb type="external" n="15"
                />Archangels, and Angels—the three lower divisions reflected (saying), <quote>What is the
                reason that these are set above, and we below? for they have not previously done
                anything more than we, neither do we fall short of them.</quote> On account of this
                reflection as a cause, according to the custom of the (divine) government, Justice
                took from both sides, and established three other middle classes of angels—Lords,
                Powers, and Rulers—that the upper might not be (unduly) exalted, nor the lower think
                themselves wronged. As for the dwelling-place of the angels, some say that above the
                firmament there are waters, and above them another heaven in the form of infinite
                light, and that this is the home of the angels. Here <pb n="11"/>too is God without
                limit, and the angels, invisible to bodily eyes, surround the throne of His majesty,
                where they minister to <quote>the tabernacle not made with hands.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11-1"/> Others say
                that, from the beginning, when God created the angels, until the second day, in
                which the firmament was made, all the classes of angels dwelt in the upper heavens;
                but when the firmament was made, they all came down below it, with the exception of
                three classes—the Cherubim, Seraphim, and Thrones<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11-2"/>—who remained above it.
                These surrounded and supported the Shechinah of God from the beginning of the world
                until <persName>our Lord</persName> ascended unto heaven; and after the Ascension, behold, they
                surround and support the throne of the <persName>Christ</persName> God, who is over all, until the end
                of the world. <persName>The Expositor</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11-3"/> and his companions say: <quote>The tabernacle which
                <persName>Moses</persName> made is a type of <pb type="external" n="16"/>the whole world.</quote> The outer
                tabernacle is the likeness of this world, but the inner tabernacle is the similitude
                of the place that is<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11-4"/> above the firmament. And as the priests ministered in
                the outer tabernacle daily, while the high priest alone entered into the inner
                tabernacle once a year; so of all rational beings, angels and men, no one has
                entered (the place) above the firmament, save the High Priest of our confession,
                <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11-5"/> The fathers, when they have been deemed worthy at any time
                to see <persName>our Lord</persName> in a revelation, have seen Him in heaven, surrounded by the
                Cherubim and Seraphim. Hence some say that there are angels above the heavens. All
                these celestial hosts have revelations both of sight and of hearing; but the
                Cherubim have revelations by sight only, because there is no mediator between them
                and God. The angels have an intellect superior to that of the rest of rational
                beings; man has stronger desire, and the demons a greater degree of anger.</p>

                waters were gathered together <pb type="external" n="18"/>into the depths of the
                earth, and the mountains and hills had appeared, God placed the sand as a limit for
                the waters of the seas,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13-4"/> that they might not pass over and cover the earth.
                And God commanded the earth, to put forth herbage and grass and every green
                thing;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13-5"/> and the earth brought forth trees and herbs and plants of all kinds,
                complete and perfect in respect of flowers and fruit and seed, each according to its
                kind. Some say that before the transgression of the command, the earth brought forth
                neither thorns nor briars, and that even the rose had no thorns as it has now; but
                that after the transgression of the command, the earth put forth thorns and briars
                by reason of the curse which it had received. The reason why God created the trees

            <p>On the fourth day God made the luminaries—sun, moon, and stars—of three substances,
                air, light, and fire. He took aerial material and prepared vessels like lamps, and
                mixed fire with light, and filled them. And because in the nature of fire there was
                no light, nor heat in that of light, <pb type="external" n="19"/>the fire imparted
                heat to the light, and the light gave luminosity to the fire; and from these two
                were the luminaries—sun, moon, and stars—fabricated. Some say that the luminaries
                were made in the morning, that the sun was placed in the east, and the moon in the
                west; while others say that they were made in the evening, and that the sun was
                placed in the west, and the moon in the east; and therefore the Jews celebrate the
                fourteenth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14-3"/> in the evening. Others say that all the luminaries when they were
                created were placed in the east; the sun completed his course by day, while the moon
                waited until eventide, and then began her course. The path of the luminaries is
                beneath the firmament, and they are not fixed as men have foolishly stated, but the
                angels guide them. <persName>Mâr Isaac</persName> says, <quote>The sun performs his course from the east to

                all the creatures, and commanded him to give a name to each of them. God did not
                gather together unto <persName>Adam</persName> all cattle, nor (all) that swim in the sea, nor (all)
                the birds of the air, that he might give them names;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18-1"/> but he received
                dominion and power over them to make use of them as he pleased, and to give them
                names, as a master to his slaves. And when God had brought him into Paradise, He
                commanded him to till it and to guard it. Why did God say <quote>to till it and to guard
                it</quote>?—for Paradise needed no guarding, and was adorned with fruit of all kinds, and
                there was none to injure it—unless it were to exhort him to keep His commandments,
                and to till it that he might not become a lover of idleness. Because <persName>Adam</persName> had not
                seen his own formation, and was not acquainted with the power of his Maker, it was
                necessary that, when <persName>Eve</persName> was taken from him in his own likeness, he should
                perceive his Maker, and should acknowledge that He who made <persName>Eve</persName> also made him, and

            <head>Of Paradise<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19-5"/></head>
            <p>In the eastern part of the earth, on the mountain of <placeName>Eden</placeName>, beyond the ocean, God
                planted Paradise, and adorned it with fruit-bearing trees of all kinds, that it
                might be a dwelling-place for <persName>Adam</persName> and his progeny, if they should keep His
                commandments. He made to spring forth from it a great river, which was parted into
                four heads,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19-6"/> to water Paradise and the whole earth. The first river is
                <placeName>Pîshôn</placeName>, which compasseth the land of <placeName>Ḥavîlâ</placeName>, where there is gold and beryls and
                fair and precious <pb n="20"/>stones. The second river is <placeName>Gîḥôn</placeName>, that is, <placeName>the
                Nile</placeName> <pb type="external" n="23"/>of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. The third river is <placeName>Deḳlath</placeName> (<placeName>the
                Tigris</placeName>), which travels through the land of <placeName>Assyria</placeName> and <placeName>Bêth-Zabdai</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20-1"/> The
                fourth river is <placeName>Pĕrath</placeName> (<placeName>the Euphrates</placeName>), which flows through the middle of the
                earth. Some teachers say that Paradise surrounds the whole earth like a wall and a
                hedge beyond the ocean. Others say that it was placed upon the mount of <placeName>Eden</placeName>,
                higher than every other mountain in the world by fifteen cubits.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20-2"/> Others say
                that it was placed between heaven and earth, below the firmament and above this
                earth, and that God placed it there as a boundary for <persName>Adam</persName> between heaven and
                earth, so that, if he kept His commands, He might lift him up to heaven, but if he
                transgressed them, He might cast him down to this earth. And as the land of heaven
                is better and more excellent than the land of Paradise, so was the land of Paradise
                better and more glorious and more excellent (than our earth); its trees were more
                beautiful, its flowers more odoriferous, and its atmosphere more pure than ours,
                through superiority of species and not by nature. God made Paradise large enough to
                be the dwelling-place of <persName>Adam</persName> and of his posterity, provided that they kept the
                divine commandments. Now it is the dwelling-place of the souls of the righteous, and
                its keepers are <persName>Enoch</persName> and <persName>Elijah</persName>; <persName>Elijah</persName> the unwedded, and <persName>Enoch</persName> the married
                man: that the unwedded may not exalt themselves above the married, as if, forsooth,
                Paradise were suitable for the unwedded only. The souls of sinners are without
                Paradise, in a deep place called Eden. After the resurrection, the souls of the
                righteous and the sinners will put on their bodies. The righteous will enter into
                heaven, which will become the land of the righteous; while the sinners will remain
                upon earth. The tree of good and evil that was in Paradise did not by nature possess
                these properties of good and evil like rational beings, but only <pb type="external"
                    n="24"/>through the deed which was wrought by its means; like the <quote>well of
                contention,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20-3"/> and the <quote>heap <pb n="21"/>of witness,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21-1"/> which did not
                possess these properties naturally, but only through the deeds which were wrought by
                their means. <persName>Adam</persName> and <persName>Eve</persName> were not stripped of the glory with which they were
                clothed, nor did they die the death of sin, because they desired and ate of the
                fruit of the fig-tree—for the fruit of the fig-tree was not better than the fruit of
                any other tree—but because of the transgression of the law, in that they were
                presumptuous and wished to become gods. On account of this foolish and wicked and
                blasphemous intention, chastisement and penalty overtook them.—Concerning the tree
                of life which was planted in the middle of Paradise, some have said that Paradise is
                the mind, that the tree of good and evil is the knowledge of material things, and
                that the tree of life is the knowledge of divine things, which were not profitable
                to the simple understanding of <persName>Adam</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21-2"/> Others have said that the tree of
                life is the kingdom of heaven and the joy of the world to come; and others that the
                tree of life was a tree in very truth, which was set in the middle of Paradise, but
                no man has ever found out what its fruit or its flowers or its nature was

            <p>When God in His goodness had made <persName>Adam</persName>, He laid down a law for him, and commanded
                him not to eat of the tree of good and evil, which is the fig-tree. After <persName>Eve</persName> was
                created, <persName>Adam</persName> told her the story of the tree; and <persName>Satan</persName> heard it, and by his
                envy it became the occasion and cause of their being made to sin, <pb
                    type="external" n="25"/>and being expelled from Paradise, for it was by reason
                of him that <persName>Adam</persName> fell from the height <pb n="22"/>of his glory. Some say that
                <persName>Satan</persName> heard when God commanded <persName>Adam</persName> not to eat of that tree. Others say that God
                commanded <persName>Adam</persName> in his mind, mentally (and not by sense); others again say, by
                sense and openly. And <persName>Satan</persName> saw that the serpent was more subtle than all
                four-footed beasts;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22-1"/> and he played in him, as it were with pipes, in the
                hearing of <persName>Eve</persName>, like an instrument, and said to her, <quote>Ye shall not die, as God
                hath said to you, but ye shall be gods like God, knowers of good and evil.</quote> Then
                <persName>Eve</persName> saw that the appearance of the fig-tree was beautiful, and that its smell was
                delightful; and she desired to eat of it and to become a goddess. So she stretched
                out her hand, and plucked, and ate, and gave also to her husband, and he likewise
                did eat. And they were stripped of the fair glory and glorious light of purity
                wherewith they were clothed, when they saw not each other’s nakedness. And <pb
                    n="23"/>their eyes were opened, and they saw their nakedness; and they took
                leaves of the fig-tree, and covered their nakedness for shame, and hid themselves
                beneath thick trees. Then God called <persName>Adam</persName> and said to him, <quote>Where art thou,
                <persName>Adam</persName>?</quote>—not that He did not know where he was, but [He asked] in a chiding
                manner—and <persName>Adam</persName> said, <quote>Lord, I heard Thy voice, and I hid myself because I am
                naked.</quote> God said, <quote>Whence knowest thou that thou art naked? peradventure hast thou
                transgressed the law and command which I laid down for thee, and hast eaten of the
                tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?</quote> <persName>Adam</persName> said, <quote>The woman whom thou gavest
                to be with me, she gave to me, and I did eat.</quote> And God questioned <persName>Eve</persName> <pb
                    type="external" n="26"/>in like manner; and <persName>Eve</persName> said, <quote>The serpent beguiled
                me, and I did eat.</quote> And God cursed the serpent, saying, <quote>Cursed art thou above all
                beasts upon the earth.</quote> With the cursing of the serpent, who was the tool of
                <persName>Satan</persName>, <persName>Satan</persName>, who had instigated the serpent, was himself cursed; and
                immediately his legs were destroyed, and he crawled upon his belly, and instead of
                being an animal became a hissing reptile. And God set enmity between the serpent and
                man, saying, <quote>He shall smite the heel of man, but man shall crush his head, and the
                food of the serpent shall be dust.</quote> God said to <persName>Eve</persName>, <quote>In pain shalt thou bring
                forth children;</quote> and to <persName>Adam</persName> He said, <quote>Cursed is the ground for thy sake, and in
                toil and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread; for dust thou art, and unto
                dust shalt thou return.</quote> And the earth, by reason of the curse which it had
                received, straightway brought forth thorns and thistles. And God drove them out from

            <p>After God had expelled them from Paradise, like wicked servants driven forth from the
                inheritance of their master, and had cast them into exile, over the gate at the

                from approaching Paradise. Some say that the cherub was one of the heavenly hosts,
                of the class of the <pb n="24"/>Cherubim; and others say that he did not belong to
                the spiritual powers, but was a terrible form endowed with a body. So also the spear
                point and the sword were made of fire extended <pb type="external" n="27"/>like a
                sharp sword, which went and came round about Paradise to terrify <persName>Adam</persName> and his
                wife. And God made for them garments of skin to cover their shame. Some say that
                they clothed themselves with the skins of animals, which they stripped off; but this
                is not credible, for all the beasts were created in couples, and <persName>Adam</persName> and <persName>Eve</persName>
                had as yet no knives to kill and flay them; hence it is clear that he means the bark
                of trees.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24-1"/> Only the blessed <persName>Moses</persName> called the bark of trees <quote>skins,</quote> because
                it fills the place of skins to trees. In the land of <placeName>India</placeName> there are trees whose
                bark is used for the clothing of kings and nobles and the wealthy, on account of its
                beauty. After God had expelled <persName>Adam</persName> and his wife from Paradise, He withheld from
                them the fruits of trees, and the use of bread and flesh and wine, and the anointing
                with oil; but they cooked grain and vegetables and the herbs of the earth, and did
                eat sparingly. Moreover, the four-footed beasts and fowl and reptiles rebelled
                against them, and some of them became enemies and adversaries unto them. They
                remained thus until <persName>Noah</persName> went forth from the ark, and then God allowed them to eat

                of <persName>Cain</persName> was rejected. And <persName>Cain</persName> was angry with God, and envied his brother; and
                he persuaded his brother to come out into the plain, and slew him. Some say that he

            <head>Of the invention of the instruments for the working in iron<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29-2"/><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29-3"/></head>
            <p>Some say that <persName>Cainan</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29-4"/> and <persName>Tubal-cain</persName>, who were of the family of <persName>Cain</persName>,
                were the first who invented the three tools of the art of working in iron, the
                anvil, hammer and tongs. The art of working in iron is the mother and begetter of
                all arts; as the head is to the body, so is it to all other crafts. And as all the
                limbs of the body cease to perform their functions if the head is taken away from
                it, so also all other arts would cease if the art of working in iron were to come to
                an end. In the days of <persName>Jubal</persName> and <persName>Tubal-cain</persName>, the sons of <persName>Lamech</persName> the blind,
                <persName>Satan</persName> entered and dwelt in them, and they constructed all kinds of musical
                instruments, harps and pipes. Some say that spirits used to go into the reeds and
                disturb them, and that the sound from them was like the sound of singing and
                pipes;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29-5"/> and men constructed all kinds of musical instruments. Now this blind
                <persName>Lamech</persName> was a hunter, and could shoot <pb n="30"/>straight with a bow; his son used
                to take him by the hand, <pb type="external" n="31"/>and guide him to places where
                there was game, and when he heard the movement of an animal,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-1"/> he shot an
                arrow at it, and brought it down. One day, when shooting an arrow at an animal, he

            <p>When Noah was five hundred years old, he took a wife from the daughters of <persName>Seth</persName>;
                and there were born to him three sons, <persName>Shem</persName>, <persName>Ham</persName> and <persName>Japhet</persName>. And God saw
                <persName>Noah</persName>’s uprightness and integrity, while all men were corrupted and polluted by
                lasciviousness;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-5"/> and He determined to remove the human race from this broad
                earth, and made this known to the blessed <persName>Noah</persName>, and commanded him to make an ark
                for the saving of himself, his sons, and the rest of the animals. <persName>Noah</persName> constructed
                this ark during the space of one hundred years, and he made it in three
                stories,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-6"/> all with boards and projecting ledges. Each board <pb n="31"/>was a
                cubit long and a span broad. The length of the ark was three hundred cubits, its
                width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. <persName>Noah</persName> made it of box wood, though
                some say of teak wood; and he pitched it within and without. At the end of the six
                hundredth year, God commanded <persName>Noah</persName>, with his wife, his sons and his
                daughters-in-law—eight souls—to go into the ark,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31-1"/> and to take in with him
                seven couples of every clean animal and fowl, and one couple of every unclean
                animal, a male and a female. And he took bread and water in with him according to
                his need: not an abundant supply, lest they might be annoyed by the smell of the
                faeces, but they got food just sufficient to preserve their lives. God forewarned
                the blessed <persName>Noah</persName> of what he was about to do seven days beforehand, in case the
                people might remember their sins and offer the sacrifice of repentance. But those
                    <pb type="external" n="32"/>rebels mocked at him scoffingly, and thrust out
                their unclean lips at the sound of the saw and the adze. After seven days God
                commanded <persName>Noah</persName> to shut the door of the ark, and to plaster it over with
                bitumen.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31-2"/> And the fountains of the deeps were broken up from beneath, and a
                torrent of rain (fell) from above, for forty days and forty nights, without
                cessation, until the waters rose fifteen cubits above the highest mountains in the
                world. And the waters bore up the ark, which travelled over them from east to west
                and from north to south, and so inscribed the figure of the cross upon the world;
                and it passed over the ocean, and came to this broad earth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31-3"/> So the rain was
                stayed, and the winds blew, and the waters remained upon the earth without
                diminishing one hundred and fifty days, besides those forty days; which, from the
                time that <persName>Noah</persName> entered the ark and the flood began until the waters began to
                diminish, make in all one hundred and ninety days, which are six months <pb n="32"
                />and ten days—even until the twentieth day of the latter Teshrî. The waters began
                to diminish from the latter Teshrî to the tenth month, on the first day of which the
                tops of the mountains appeared, but until the time when the earth was dry, and the
                dove found rest for the sole of her foot, was one hundred days. The ark rested upon
                the top of <placeName>mount Ḳardô</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32-1"/> In the tenth month, which is Shĕbâṭ,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32-2"/>
                <persName>Noah</persName> opened the door of the ark, and sent a raven to bring him news of the earth.
                And it went and found dead bodies, and it alighted upon them and returned not. For
                this reason people have made a proverb <pb type="external" n="33"/>about <persName>Noah</persName>’s
                raven. Again he sent forth a dove, but it found not a place whereon to alight, and
                returned to the ark. After seven days he sent forth another dove, and it returned to
                him in the evening carrying an olive leaf in its bill; and <persName>Noah</persName> knew that the
                waters had subsided. <persName>Noah</persName> remained in the ark a full year, and he came forth from
                it and offered up an offering of clean animals; and God accepted his offering and
                promised him that He would never again bring a flood upon the face of the earth, nor
                again destroy beasts and men by a flood; and He gave him (as) a token the bow in the
                clouds, and from that day the bow has appeared in the clouds; and He commanded him
                to slay and eat the flesh of beasts and birds after he had poured out their blood.
                The number of people who came forth from the ark was eight souls, and they built the
                town of <placeName>Thĕmâmôn</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32-3"/> after the name of the eight souls, and it is to-day the
                seat of a bishopric in the province of <placeName>Ṣûbâ</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32-4"/> <persName>Noah</persName> planted a vineyard,
                and drank of its wine; and one day when he slumbered, and was sunk in the deep sleep
                of drunkenness, his nakedness was uncovered within his tent. When <persName>Ham</persName> his son saw
                him, he laughed at him and despised him, and told his brethren <persName>Shem</persName> and <pb n="33"
                /><persName>Japhet</persName>. But <persName>Shem</persName> and <persName>Japhet</persName> took a cloak upon their shoulders, and walked
                backwards with their faces turned away, and threw the cloak over their father and
                covered him, and then they looked upon him. When <persName>Noah</persName> awoke and knew what had been
                done to him by the two sets of his sons, he cursed <persName>Canaan</persName> the son of <persName>Ham</persName> and
                said, <quote>Thou shalt be a servant to thy brethren;</quote> but he blessed <persName>Shem</persName> and <persName>Japhet</persName>.
                The reason why he cursed <persName>Canaan</persName>, who was not as yet born nor had sinned, was
                because <persName>Ham</persName> had been saved with him in the ark from the waters <pb type="external"
                    n="34"/>of the flood, and had with his father received the divine blessing; and
                also because the arts of sin—I mean music and dancing and all other hateful
                things—were about to be revived by his posterity, for the art of music proceeded
                from the seed of <persName>Canaan</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33-1"/> After the flood a son was born to <persName>Noah</persName>, and he
                called his name <persName>Jônaṭôn</persName>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33-2"/> and he provided him with gifts and sent him to
                the fire of the sun, to the east. <persName>Noah</persName> lived after the flood three hundred and
                fifty years; the sum of his years was nine hundred and fifty years; and he saw
                eighteen generations and families before and after it. He died on the fourth day of
                the week, on the second of Nîsân, at the second hour of the day; his son <persName>Shem</persName>
                embalmed him, and his sons buried him, and mourned over him forty days.</p>

                <persName>Shâlâḥ</persName> was written down in the genealogies; but <persName>Mâlâḥ</persName> was not, because his

                was crucified. When they had laid the coffin down there, the earth was rent in the

                and blessed him and delivered to him the priesthood, and commanded him to dwell

            <p>When <persName>Reu</persName> was born in the days of <persName>Peleg</persName>, the sons of <persName>Noah</persName>, <persName>Shem</persName>, <persName>Ham</persName>, and

                <placeName>Shinar</placeName>. And they took counsel together, saying, <quote>Come, let us build for ourselves
                a high tower, the top of which shall be in the heavens, lest a flood come again upon
                us, and destroy us from off the face of the earth.</quote> And they began to make bricks
                and to build, until (the tower) was reared a great height from the ground. Then they
                determined to build seventy-two other towers around it, and to set up a chief over
                each tower to govern those who were under his authority. God saw the weariness of
                their oppression and the hardness of their toil, and in His mercy had compassion
                upon them; for the higher they went, the more severe became their labour, and their
                pain went on increasing, by reason of the violence of the winds and storms and the
                heat of the <pb n="42"/>luminaries and the necessity of carrying up everything they
                needed. And God said, <quote>Come, let us go down and divide the tongues there.</quote> The
                expression <quote>Come, let us,</quote> resembles <quote>Come, let us make man in our image and in our
                likeness,</quote> and refers to the persons of the adorable Trinity. While they were
                tormenting themselves with that vain labour, their language was suddenly confounded
                so as to become seventy-two languages, <pb type="external" n="41"/>and they
                understood not each other’s speech, and were scattered throughout the whole world,
                and built cities, every man with his fellow who spoke the same language. From <persName>Adam</persName>
                to the building of the tower, there was only one language, and that was Syriac. Some
                have said that it was Hebrew; but the Hebrews were not called by this name until

                his crossing they were called Hebrews. It was grievous to <persName>Peleg</persName> that the tongues
                were confounded (or, that God had confounded the tongues of mankind) in his days,
                and he died; and his sons <persName>Serug</persName> and <persName>Nahor</persName> buried him in the town of <placeName>Pâlgîn</placeName>,

                camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a very large train of
                servants. <pb type="external" n="43"/>This man was the greatest of all the children

                yet speaking, there came another and said to him, <quote>The Chaldeans divided themselves
                into three bands and fell upon the camels and carried them off, and slew the young

                heaven; and they sat with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none
                spake a word, for they saw that his blow was very sore. And when he held fast by his
                God, He blessed him, and gave him seven sons and three daughters; and there were not
                found in the whole land women more beautiful than <persName>Job</persName>’s daughters, and their names
                were <persName>Jemima</persName>, <persName>Keren-happuch</persName>, and <persName>Kezia</persName>. And God gave him fourteen <pb n="45"
                />thousand sheep, six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen; and Job lived one
                hundred and forty years after his temptation, and died in peace.</p>

            <p><persName>Jacob</persName> was seventy-seven years old when his father <persName>Isaac</persName> blessed him; and he stole
                the blessings and birthright from his brother <persName>Esau</persName>, and fled from before his
                brother to <placeName>Ḥarrân</placeName>. On the first night <persName>Jacob</persName> saw a ladder reaching from earth to
                heaven, with angels ascending and descending, and the Power of God upon the top
                thereof. And he woke and said, <pb type="external" n="45"/><quote>This is the house of the
                Lord.</quote> He took the stone that was under his head, and set it up for an altar; and he
                vowed a vow to God. Now the ladder was a type of <persName>Christ</persName>’s crucifixion; the angels
                that were ascending and descending were a type of the angels who announced the glad
                tidings to the shepherds on the day of <persName>our Saviour</persName>’s birth. The Power of God which
                was upon the top of the ladder was (a type of) the manifestation of God the Word in
                pure flesh of the formation of <persName>Adam</persName>. The place in which the vision appeared was a
                type of the church; the stone under his head, which he set up for an altar, was a
                type of the altar; and the oil which he poured out upon it was like the holy oil
                wherewith they anoint the altar.</p>
            <p>And <persName>Jacob</persName> went to <persName>Laban the Aramean</persName>, his mother’s brother, and served before him
                as a shepherd for fourteen years. And he took his two daughters to wife; <persName>Leah</persName> with
                her handmaid <persName>Zilpah</persName>, and <persName>Rachel</persName> with her handmaid <persName>Bilhah</persName>. Now he loved
                <persName>Rachel</persName> more than <persName>Leah</persName>, because she was the younger and was fair in aspect, while
                <persName>Leah</persName> had watery eyes. There were born to <persName>Jacob</persName> by <persName>Leah</persName> six sons: <persName>Rûbîl</persName>
                (<persName>Reuben</persName>), which is interpreted <quote>Great is God</quote> (now <persName>Jacob</persName> was eighty-four years

            <p>After <persName>Jacob</persName>’s sons had been born to him by <persName>Leah</persName>, then <persName>Joseph</persName> and <persName>Benjamin</persName>
                were born to him (by <persName>Rachel</persName>); and he loved <persName>Joseph</persName> more than all his children,
                because he was the child of (his) old age, and because of his beauty and purity, and
                his being left motherless. He made him a garment with long sleeves, and his brethren
                envied him. And he dreamed dreams twice, and their hatred increased, and they kept
                anger in their hearts against him. They sold him to the Midianites, who carried him
                to <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and sold him to <persName>Potiphar</persName>, the chief of the guards; and <persName>Potiphar</persName>
                delivered his house and servants into his hands; but because of the wantonness of
                <persName>Potiphar</persName>’s wife, he was bound and kept in prison for two years. When the chief
                cup-bearer and the chief baker dreamed dreams in one night, and Joseph interpreted
                them, his words actually came to pass. After <persName>Joseph</persName> had remained in bondage two
                years, Pharaoh the king of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> saw two dreams in one night; and he was troubled
                and disturbed, and the sorcerers and enchanters and wise men were unable to
                interpret his dreams. Then one of those who had been imprisoned with <persName>Joseph</persName>
                remembered (him), and they told Pharaoh; <pb n="47"/>and <persName>Joseph</persName> interpreted his
                dreams, and Pharaoh made him king over <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. And Joseph gathered together and
                collected the corn of the seven prosperous years, and saved it for the seven years
                of famine. When the household of <persName>Jacob</persName> lacked bread, <persName>Jacob</persName> sent his sons to
                <placeName>Egypt</placeName> to buy corn, <pb type="external" n="47"/>and they met <persName>Joseph</persName>, and he
                recognised them, but they did not know him. After he had tortured them twice by his
                harsh words, he at last revealed himself to them, and shewed himself to his
                brethren. And he sent and brought his father Jacob and all his family—seventy-five
                souls in number, and they came down and dwelt in the land of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> two hundred and
                thirty years. Concerning that which God spake to <persName>Abraham</persName>, <quote>Thy seed shall be a
                sojourner in a strange land four hundred and thirty years;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n47-1"/> they were under

                went forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. <persName>Jacob</persName> died in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and he commanded that he should be
                buried with his fathers; and they carried him and buried him by the side of his
                fathers in the land of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. After <persName>Joseph</persName> died, another king arose, who
                knew not <persName>Joseph</persName>, and he oppressed the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> with heavy labour in
                clay; at that time <persName>Moses</persName> was born in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. Since many have written the history
                of the blessed <persName>Joseph</persName> at great length, and the blessed <persName>Mâr Ephraim</persName> has written
                his history in twelve discourses, concerning everything which happened to him from
                his childhood to his death, as well as another discourse upon the carrying up of his

            <p>After <persName>Joseph</persName> was dead, and another king had arisen who knew not <pb type="external"
                    n="48"/>the Israelitish people, the people increased and became strong in
                <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. And Pharaoh was afraid of them, and laid a burden upon them, and oppressed
                them with hard work in clay, and demanded a <pb n="48"/>tale of bricks from them
                without giving them straw. At that time <persName>Moses</persName> the son of <persName>Amram</persName>, the son of
                <persName>Kohath</persName>, the son of <persName>Levi</persName>, was born. <persName>Levi</persName> was forty-six years old when he begat
                <persName>Kohath</persName>; <persName>Kohath</persName> was sixty-three years old when he begat <persName>Amram</persName>; and <persName>Amram</persName> was
                seventy years old when he begat <persName>Moses</persName>. When <persName>Moses</persName> was born, Pharaoh the king
                commanded to throw the new-born children of the Israelites into the river. <persName>Moses</persName>
                was beautiful in appearance, and he was called Pantîl<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48-1"/> and Amlâkyâ; and the
                Egyptians used to call him the Shakwîthâ<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48-2"/> of the daughter of Pharaoh. The
                name of <persName>Moses</persName>’ mother was <persName>Yokâbâr</persName> (<persName>Jochebed</persName>). When the command of the king
                went forth for the drowning of the infants, she made a little ark covered with
                pitch, and laid the child in it; and she carried it and placed it in a shallow part
                of the waters of <placeName>the river Nile</placeName> (that is <placeName>Gîḥôn</placeName>); and she sat down opposite (that
                is, at a distance), to see what would be the end of the child. And <persName>Shîpôr</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48-3"/>
                the daughter of Pharaoh, came to bathe in the river—some say that she was called
                <persName>Tharmĕsîs</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48-4"/>—and she saw the ark and commanded it to be fetched. When she
                opened it, and saw that the appearance of <pb n="49"/>the child was beautiful and
                his complexion comely, she said, <quote>Verily this child is one of the Hebrews'
                    children;</quote> and she took him, and reared him up as her son. She sought a Hebrew
                nurse, and the mother of the child <persName>Moses</persName> came, and became a nurse to him; and he
                was reared <pb type="external" n="49"/>in the house of Pharaoh until he was forty
                years old. One day he saw <persName>Pethkôm<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n49-1"/> the Egyptian</persName>, one of the servants of
                Pharaoh, quarrelling with an Israelite and reviling him. <persName>Moses</persName> looked this way and
                that way, and saw no man; and zeal entered into him, and he slew the Egyptian and
                buried him in the sand. Two days after, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling with one
                another. And he said to them, <quote>Ye are brethren; why quarrel ye with one another?</quote>
                And one of them thrust him away from him, saying, <quote>Dost thou peradventure seek to
                kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?</quote> Then <persName>Moses</persName> feared lest Pharaoh
                should perceive (this) and slay him; and he fled to <placeName>Midian</placeName>, and sat by the well
                there. Now <persName>Reuel the Midianite</persName> had seven daughters, who used to come to that well
                and water their father’s flocks; and the shepherds came and drove them away; and
                <persName>Moses</persName> arose and delivered them, and watered their flocks. When they went to their
                father, he said to them, <quote>Ye have come quickly to-day.</quote> They said to him, <quote>An
                Egyptian rescued us from the hands of the shepherds, and watered the flocks also.</quote>
                He said to them, <quote>Why did ye not bring him? Go quickly and call him hither to eat

            <p>When <persName>Adam</persName> and <persName>Eve</persName> went forth from Paradise, <persName>Adam</persName>, as if knowing that he was
                never to return to his place, cut off a branch from the tree of good and evil—which
                is the fig-tree—and took it with him and went forth; and it served him as a staff
                all the days of his life. After the death of <persName>Adam</persName>, his son <persName>Seth</persName> took it, for
                there were no weapons as yet at that time. This rod was passed on from hand to hand
                unto <persName>Noah</persName>, and from <persName>Noah</persName> to <persName>Shem</persName>; and it was handed down from <persName>Shem</persName> to
                <persName>Abraham</persName> as a blessed thing from the Paradise of God. With this rod <persName>Abraham</persName> broke
                the images and graven idols which his father made, and therefore God said to him,
                <quote>Get thee out of thy father’s house,</quote> etc. It was in his hand in every country as
                far as <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and from <placeName>Egypt</placeName> to <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. Afterwards <persName>Isaac</persName> took it, and (it
                was handed down) from <persName>Isaac</persName> to <persName>Jacob</persName>; with it he fed the flocks of <persName>Laban the
                Aramean</persName> in <placeName>Paddan Aram</placeName>. After <persName>Jacob</persName> <persName>Judah</persName> his fourth son took it; and this is
                the rod which <persName>Judah</persName> gave to <persName>Tamar</persName> his daughter-in-law, with his signet ring <pb
                    type="external" n="51"/>and his napkin, as the hire for what he had done. From
                him (it came) to <persName>Pharez</persName>. At that time there were wars everywhere, and an angel
                took the rod, and laid it in the <placeName>Cave of Treasures</placeName> in the <placeName>mount of Moab</placeName>, until
                <placeName>Midian</placeName> was built. There was in <placeName>Midian</placeName> a man, upright and righteous before God,
                whose name was <persName>Yathrô</persName> (<persName>Jethro</persName>). When he was feeding his flock on the mountain,
                he found the cave and took the rod by divine agency; and with it he fed his sheep
                until his old age. When he gave his daughter to <persName>Moses</persName>, he said to him, <quote>Go in, my
                son, take the rod, and go forth to thy flock.</quote> When <persName>Moses</persName> had set his foot upon
                the threshold of the door, an angel moved the rod, and it came out of its own free
                will towards <persName>Moses</persName>. And <persName>Moses</persName> took the rod, and it was with him until God spake
                with him on <placeName>mount Sinai</placeName>. When God said to him, <quote>Cast the rod upon the ground,</quote> he
                did so, and it became a great serpent; and the Lord said, <quote>Take it,</quote> and he did so,
                and it became a rod as at first. This is the rod which God gave him for a <pb n="51"
                />help and a deliverance, that it might be a wonder, and that with it he might
                deliver <placeName>Israel</placeName> from the oppression of the Egyptians. By the will of the living God
                this rod became a serpent in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. By it God spake to <persName>Moses</persName>; and it swallowed
                up the rod of <persName>Pôsdî the sorceress</persName> of the Egyptians. With it <persName>Moses</persName> smote the <placeName>sea
                of Sôph</placeName> in its length and breadth, and the depths congealed in the heart of the
                sea. It was in <persName>Moses</persName>’ hands in the wilderness of <placeName>Ashîmôn</placeName>, and with it he smote
                the stony rock, and the waters flowed forth. Then God gave serpents power over the

                angered Him at the waters of strife. And <persName>Moses</persName> prayed before the Lord, and God
                said to him, <quote>Make thee a brazen serpent, and lift it up with the rod, and let the
                children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> look upon it and be healed.</quote> <persName>Moses</persName> did as the Lord had
                commanded him, and he placed the brazen serpent in the sight of all the children of
                <placeName>Israel</placeName> in the wilderness; and they looked upon it and were healed. After all the
                children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> were dead, save <persName>Joshua the son of <persName>Num</persName></persName> and <persName>Caleb the son of
                <persName>Yôphannâ</persName></persName> (<persName>Jephunneh</persName>), they went into the promised land, and took the rod with
                them, on account of the wars with the Philistines and Amalekites. And <persName>Phineas</persName> hid
                the rod in the desert, in the dust at the gate of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, where it remained
                until <persName>our Lord Christ</persName> was born. And He, by the will of His divinity, shewed the
                rod to <persName>Joseph</persName> the husband of <persName>Mary</persName>, and it was in his hand when he fled to
                <placeName>Egypt</placeName> with <persName>our Lord</persName> and <persName>Mary</persName>, until he returned to <placeName>Nazareth</placeName>. From <persName>Joseph</persName>
                his son <persName>Jacob</persName>, who was surnamed the brother of <persName>our Lord</persName>, took it; and from
                <persName>Jacob</persName> <persName>Judas Iscariot</persName>, who was a thief, stole it. When the Jews crucified <persName>our
                Lord</persName>, they lacked wood for the arms of <persName>our Lord</persName>; and Judas in his wickedness gave

                (for a whole lamb), let him and his neighbour who is near him share it. Let the lamb
                be kept until the fourteenth day of this month, and let all the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>
                slay it at sunset, and let them sprinkle its blood upon the thresholds of their
                houses with the sign of the cross. This blood shall be to you a sign of deliverance,
                and I will see (it) and rejoice in you, and Death the destroyer shall no more have

                the blood upon the thresholds, and will not allow the destroyer to enter their
                houses.</quote> When it was midnight, the Lord slew the firstborn of the Egyptians, from
                the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting upon his throne down to the last. And Pharaoh sent
                to <persName>Moses</persName> and <persName>Aaron</persName>, saying, <quote>Depart from among my people, and go, serve the <pb

                Egyptians also urged the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to go forth from among them, through
                fear of death; and the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> asked chains of gold and silver and
                costly clothing of the Egyptians, and spoiled them; and the Lord gave them favour in
                the sight of the Egyptians. The children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> set out from <placeName>Raamses</placeName> to

                Pharaoh pursued after them to bring them back to his slavery. And they said to
                <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Why hast thou brought us out from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>? It was better for us to serve
                the Egyptians as slaves, and not to die here.</quote> <persName>Moses</persName> said, <quote>Fear not, but see the
                deliverance which God will work for you to-day.</quote> And the Lord said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Lift
                up thy rod and smite the sea, that the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> may pass over as upon
                dry land.</quote> And <persName>Moses</persName> smote the sea, and it was divided on this side and on that;
                and the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> passed through the depth of the sea as upon dry land.
                When Pharaoh and his hosts came in after them, <persName>Moses</persName> brought his rod back over the
                sea, and the waters returned to their place; and all the Egyptians were drowned. And
                <persName>Moses</persName> bade the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to sing praises with the song <quote>Then sang

            <p>The children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> marched through the wilderness three days, and came to the

                were unable to drink that water. And they lifted up their voice and murmured against
                <persName>Moses</persName>, saying, <quote>What shall we drink?</quote> <persName>Moses</persName> prayed before God, and took
                absinth-wood,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n54-1"/> which is bitter in its nature, and threw it into the water,
                and it was made sweet. There did the Lord teach them laws and judgments. <pb

                the second month, which is Îyâr, came to a place in which there were twelve wells
                and seventy <pb n="55"/>palm-trees.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55-1"/> <persName>Dâd-Îshôʿ</persName> says in his exposition of

                <persName>Moses</persName>, lived there. There was a well in that place, and over it was a bucket and
                brass chain; and devils dwelt there, because that place resembled Paradise. The
                blessed <persName>Mâḳârîs</persName> (<persName>Macarius</persName>) visited that spot, but was unable to live there
                because of the wickedness of those demons; but that they might not boast over the
                human race, as if forsooth no one was able to live there, God commanded two
                anchorites, whose names no man knoweth, and they dwelt there until they died. When
                the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> saw that wilderness, they murmured against <persName>Moses</persName>, saying,
                <quote>It were better for us to have died in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, being satisfied with bread, than to
                come forth into this arid desert for this people to perish by hunger.</quote> And God said
                to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Behold, I will bring manna down from heaven for you; a cloud shall
                shade you by day from the heat of the sun, and a pillar of fire shall give light
                before you by night.</quote> God said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Go up into this mountain, thou, and
                <persName>Aaron</persName> thy brother, and <persName>Nadab</persName>, and seventy chosen elders of the children of

                himself.</quote> And they did as the Lord commanded them, and <persName>Moses</persName> drew near by himself,
                and the rest of the elders remained below at the foot of the mountain; and God gave
                him commandments. And <persName>Moses</persName> made known to the people the words <pb type="external"
                    n="58"/>of the Lord; and all the people answered with one voice and said,
                <quote>Everything that the Lord commands us we will do.</quote> <persName>Moses</persName> took blood with a hyssop,
                and sprinkled it upon the people, saying to them, <quote>This is the blood of the
                covenant,</quote> and so forth. And God said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Say unto the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>
                that they set apart for Me gold and silver and brass and purple,</quote> and the rest of
                the things which are mentioned in the Tôrâh, <quote>and let them make a tabernacle for
                Me.</quote> God also shewed the construction thereof to <persName>Moses</persName>, saying, <quote>Let <persName>Aaron</persName> and
                his sons be priests to Me, and let them serve My altar and sanctuary.</quote> God wrote ten
                commandments<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55-3"/> on two tables of stone, and these are they. Thou shalt not make
                to thyself an image or a likeness; thou shalt not falsify thy oaths; keep <pb n="56"
                />the day of the Sabbath; honour thy father and thy mother; thou shalt not do
                murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear
                false witness; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s or brother’s house; thou shalt
                not covet the wife of thy kinsman or neighbour, nor his servants, nor his
                handmaidens. When the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> saw that <persName>Moses</persName> tarried on the mountain,
                they gathered together to <persName>Aaron</persName> and said to him, <quote>Arise, make us a god to go
                before us, for we know not what has become of thy brother <persName>Moses</persName>.</quote> <persName>Aaron</persName> said to
                them, <quote>Bring me the earrings that are in the ears of your wives and children.</quote> When
                they had brought them to him, he cast a calf from them, and said to the people,
                <quote>This is thy god, O <placeName>Israel</placeName>, who brought thee out of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>;</quote> and they built an
                altar, and the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> offered up sacrifice upon it. God said to
                <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Get thee down <pb type="external" n="59"/>to the people, for they have
                become corrupt.</quote> And <persName>Moses</persName> returned to the people, and in his hands were the two
                tablets of stone, upon which the ten commandments were written by the finger of God.
                When <persName>Moses</persName> saw that the people had erred, he was angry and smote the tablets upon
                the side of the mountain and brake them. And <persName>Moses</persName> brought the calf, and filed it
                with a file, and threw it into the fire, and cast its ashes into water; and he
                commanded the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to drink of that water. And <persName>Moses</persName> reproached
                <persName>Aaron</persName> for his deeds, but <persName>Aaron</persName> said, <quote>Thou knowest that the people is
                stiffnecked.</quote> Then <persName>Moses</persName> said to the children of <persName>Levi</persName>, <quote>The Lord commands you
                that each man should slay his brother and his neighbour of those who have wrought
                iniquity;</quote> and there were slain on that day three thousand men. And <persName>Moses</persName> went up
                to the mountain a second time, and there were with him two tables of stone instead
                of those which he brake. He remained on the mountain and fasted another forty days,
                praying and supplicating God to pardon the iniquity of the people. When he came down
                from the mountain with the other two tablets upon which the commandments were
                written, the skin of his face shone, and the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> were unable to
                look upon his countenance by reason of the radiance and light with which it was
                suffused; and they were afraid of him. When he came to the people, he covered his
                face with a napkin; and when he spake with God, he uncovered his face. And <persName>Moses</persName>
                said to <persName>Ḥur</persName>, the son of his father-in-law <persName>Reuel the Midianite</persName>, <quote>We will go to
                the land <pb n="57"/>which God promised to give us; come with us, and we will do
                thee good;</quote> but he would not, and returned to <placeName>Midian</placeName>. <pb type="external" n="60"
                />So the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> went along the road to prepare a dwelling-place for
                themselves; and they lifted up their voice with a cry; and God heard and was angry,
                and fire went round about them and burnt up the parts round about their camps. They
                said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Our soul languishes in this wilderness, and we remember the meats
                of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>; the fishes and the cucumbers and the melons and the onions and the leeks
                and the garlic; and now we have nought save this manna which is before us.</quote> Now the
                appearance of manna was like that of coriander seed, and they ground it, and made
                flat cakes of it; and its taste was like bread with oil in it. And the Lord heard
                the voice of the people weeping each one at the door of his tent, and it was
                grievous to Him. <persName>Moses</persName> prayed before the Lord and said, <quote>Why have I not found
                favour before Thee? and why hast Thou cast the weight of this people upon me? Did I
                beget them? Either slay me or let me find favour in Thy sight.</quote> God said to <persName>Moses</persName>,
                <quote>Choose from the elders of the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> seventy men, and gather them
                together to the tabernacle, and I will come down and speak with thee. And I will
                take of the spirit and power which is with thee and will lay it upon them, and they
                shall bear the burden of the people with thee, and thou shalt not bear it by thyself
                alone;</quote> and <persName>Moses</persName> told them. <persName>Moses</persName> gathered together seventy elders from the
                children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake with them; and he
                took of the spirit and power which was with <persName>Moses</persName> and laid it upon them, and they
                prophesied. But two elders of the seventy whose names were written down remained in
                the camp and did not come; the name of the one was <persName>Eldad</persName>, and that of the other
                <persName>Medad</persName>; and they also prophesied in the tabernacle. A young man came and told

                would not suffice for them; and if we collect for them (all) the fish that are in
                the sea, they would not satisfy them.</quote> And the Lord said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>The hand of
                the Lord shall bring (this) to pass, and behold, thou shalt see whether this happens
                or not.</quote> By the command of God a wind blew and brought out quails from the sea, and
                they were gathered around the camp of the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> about a day’s journey
                on all sides; and they were piled upon one another to the depth of two cubits. Each
                of the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> gathered about ten cors; and they spread them out before
                the doors of their tents. And the Lord was angry with them, and smote them with
                death, and many died; and that place was called <quote>the graves of lust.</quote></p>
            <p>They departed from thence to the place called <placeName>Ḥaṣerôth</placeName>. And <persName>Aaron</persName> and <persName>Miriam</persName>
                lifted up themselves against <persName>Moses</persName> because of the Cushite woman whom he had
                married, and they said, <quote>Has God spoken with <persName>Moses</persName> only? Behold, He hath spoken
                with us also.</quote> Now <persName>Moses</persName> was meeker than all men. And God heard the words of
                <persName>Miriam</persName> and <persName>Aaron</persName>, and came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of
                the tabernacle, <pb type="external" n="62"/>and called them, and they came forth to
                Him. The Lord said to them, <quote>Hear what I will say to you. I have revealed Myself to
                you in secret, and ye have prophesied in a dream. Not so with My servant <persName>Moses</persName>,
                who is trusted in everything, for with him I speak mouth to mouth.</quote> And the Lord was
                angry with them, and the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle; and <persName>Miriam</persName> was a
                leper, and was white as snow. <persName>Aaron</persName> saw that she was a leper, and said to <persName>Moses</persName>,
                <quote>I entreat thee not to look upon our sins which we have sinned against thee.</quote>
                <persName>Moses</persName> made supplication before God, saying, <quote>Heal her, O Lord, I entreat Thee.</quote>
                God said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>If her father had spat in her face, it would have been right
                for her to pass the night alone outside the camp for seven days, and then to come
                in.</quote> So <persName>Miriam</persName> stayed outside the camp for seven days, and then she was
                purified.</p>
            <pb n="59"/>
            <p>And God said to <persName>Moses</persName>, <quote>Send forth spies, from every tribe a man, and let them go
                and search out the land of promise.</quote> <persName>Moses</persName> chose twelve men, among whom were
                <persName>Joshua the son of <persName>Num</persName></persName> and <persName>Caleb</persName> the son of <persName>Jephunneh</persName>; and they went and
                searched out the land. And they returned, carrying with them of the fruit of the
                land grapes and figs and pomegranates. The spies came and said, <quote>We have not

            <p>The children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> gathered together unto <persName>Moses</persName> and <persName>Aaron</persName> and said to them,

                with his censer he separated the living from the dead, and the plague was stayed
                from them. The number of men whom the plague destroyed at that time of the children

                The children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> began to commit fornication with the daughters of <placeName>Moab</placeName>,
                and to bow down to their idols, and to eat of their sacrifices. The Lord was angry
                with them, and He commanded <persName>Moses</persName> to gather together the children of <pb n="63"
                /><placeName>Israel</placeName>, and to order every man to slay his fellow, and every one who should bow
                down to <persName>Baal Peôr</persName>, the idol of the Moabites. When they were all assembled at the

                sight of <persName>Moses</persName> and all the people; and God smote the people with a pestilence.
                Then <persName>Phinehas</persName> the son of <persName>Eleazar</persName> the priest, the son of <persName>Aaron</persName>, arose, and
                thrust them through with a spear, and lifted them up upon the top of it; and the
                plague was stayed from that hour. This zeal was accounted unto <persName>Phinehas</persName> as a

                generation, even for ever.</quote> The number of those who died at that time was
                twenty-four thousand men. God commanded <persName>Moses</persName> to number the people, and their
                number amounted to six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and eighty souls. And
                God commanded <persName>Moses</persName> to bless <persName>Joshua the son of <persName>Num</persName></persName>, and to lay his hand upon
                him, and to set him up before <persName>Eleazar</persName> the priest and before all the children of
                <placeName>Israel</placeName>; and God gave him wisdom and knowledge and prophecy and courage, and made
                him ruler of the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. God commanded the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> to
                destroy the Midianites. And (<persName>Moses</persName>) chose from each tribe a thousand men, and they
                went up against the Midianites and took them captive and spoiled them. And <persName>Moses</persName>
                told them to slay every man who had committed fornication with a Midianitish woman,
                and every Midianitish woman who had committed fornication with a son of <placeName>Israel</placeName>,
                except the virgins whom man had not known. God commanded <persName>Moses</persName> to set apart
                one-fiftieth part of the spoil for the sons of <persName>Levi</persName>, the ministers of the altar
                and the house of the Lord. The number of the flocks that were gathered together with
                the children <pb type="external" n="69"/>of <placeName>Israel</placeName> was six hundred and seventy
                thousand, and seventy-two thousand oxen, and thirty-two thousand virgins. And the
                Lord commanded them that when they should pass over <placeName>the Jordan</placeName> and come to the
                land of promise, they should set apart three villages for a place of flight and
                refuge, that whosoever committed a murder involuntarily might flee thither and dwell
                in them until the high priest <pb n="64"/>of that time died, when he might return to
                his family and the house of his fathers. God laid down for them laws and
                commandments, and these are they. A man shall not clothe himself in a woman’s
                garments, neither shall a woman clothe herself in those of a man.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n64-1"/> If one
                sees a bird’s nest, he shall drive away the mother, and then take the young

                habitation. And <persName>Dinah</persName> his wife conceived, and brought forth <persName>Mary</persName>; and from that
                day she was called <persName>Hannah</persName> (<persName>Anna</persName>) instead of <persName>Dinah</persName>, for the Lord had had
                compassion upon her. Now the name <quote><persName>Mary</persName></quote> (<persName>Maryam</persName> or <persName>Miriam</persName>) is interpreted
                <quote>lifted up,</quote> <quote>exalted;</quote> and they rejoiced in her exceedingly. And after six months
                her parents said to one another, <quote>We will not allow her to walk upon the
                ground;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n76-3"/> <pb n="77"/>and they carried her with sacrifices and offerings, and
                brought her to the temple of the Lord. And they sacrificed oxen and sheep to the
                Lord, and offered <persName>Mary</persName> to the high priest. He laid his hand upon her head, and
                blessed her, saying, <quote>Blessed shalt thou be among women.</quote> Two years after she was
                weaned, they brought her to the temple of the Lord, even as they had vowed to the
                Lord, and delivered her to the high priest. He laid his hand upon her head, and
                blessed her, and said to her <pb type="external" n="84"/>that she should give
                herself over to the aged women who were there. And she was brought up with the
                virgins in the temple of the Lord, and performed the service of the temple with
                joyful heart and godly fervour until she was twelve years old. Because she was
                beautiful in appearance, the priests and the high priest took counsel and prayed
                before God that He would reveal to them what they should do with her.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n77-1"/> And
                the angel of God appeared unto the high priest and said to him, <quote>Gather together the
                staves of the men who have been left widowers by their first wives, and are well
                known for piety, uprightness, and righteousness, and what God sheweth thee, do.</quote> And
                they brought many staves and laid them down in the temple; and they prayed before
                God that day and its night. The chief priest went into the temple and gave to each
                of them his staff, and when <persName>Joseph</persName> took his staff in his hand, there went forth
                from it a white dove, and hovered over the top of the rod, and sat upon it. The
                chief priest drew near to <persName>Joseph</persName> and kissed him on his head, and said to him, <quote>The
                blessed maiden has fallen to thy lot from the Lord; take her to thee until she
                arrives at the age for marriage, and (then) make a marriage feast after the manner
                and custom of men; for it is meet for thee (to do so) more than others, because ye
                are cousins.</quote> <persName>Joseph</persName> said to the chief priest, <quote>I am an old and feeble man, and
                this is a girl, and unfit for my aged condition; it is better to give her to one of
                her own age, because I cannot rely upon myself to watch her and guard her.</quote> The
                chief priest said to him, <quote>Take heed that thou dost not transgress <pb
                    type="external" n="85"/>the command of God, and bring a punishment upon thee.</quote>
                So <persName>Joseph</persName> took <persName>Mary</persName>, and went to his dwelling-place.</p>
            <p><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n77-2"/>Some days after the priests distributed various coloured silken <pb n="78"

                before the Lord, suddenly the <persName>archangel Gabriel</persName> appeared to her in the form of a

                when she saw (him), she was terrified at his words, and was thinking what this
                salutation was. The angel said to her, <quote>Fear not <persName>Mary</persName>, for thou hast found grace
                with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive <pb type="external" n="86"/>and bear a
                son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted, <quote>our God is with
                us</quote>. This (child) shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest.</quote>
                <persName>Mary</persName> said to the angel, <quote>Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me
                according to thy word.</quote> And the angel went away from her. In those days <persName>Mary</persName>
                arose, and went to <persName>Elizabeth</persName> her cousin, and she went in and saluted <persName>Elizabeth</persName>.
                And it came to pass that when <persName>Elizabeth</persName> heard <persName>Mary</persName>’s salutation, the babe leaped
                in her womb, and <persName>John</persName> in <persName>Elizabeth</persName>’s womb bowed down to <persName>our Lord</persName> in <persName>Mary</persName>’s
                womb, as a servant to his master. <persName>Mary</persName> remained with <persName>Elizabeth</persName> about three
                months, and then returned to her house. After the lapse of six months, <persName>Joseph</persName> saw
                that <persName>Mary</persName> had conceived, and he was troubled in his mind, and said, <quote>What answer
                shall I give to the high priest in respect of this trial which has befallen me?</quote> And
                because he relied upon the purity of his spouse, he fell into perplexity <pb n="79"
                />and doubt, and said to her, <quote>Whence hast thou this? and who has beguiled thee, O
                perfect dove? Wast thou not brought up with the pure virgins and venerable matrons
                in the temple of the Lord?</quote> And she wept, saying, <quote>As the Lord God liveth, I have
                never known man nor had connexion with any one;</quote> but she did not speak to him of the
                angel and the cause of her conception. Then <persName>Joseph</persName> meditated within himself and
                said, <quote>If I reveal this matter before men, I fear lest it may be from God; and if I
                keep it back and hide it, I fear the rebuke and penalty of the law.</quote> For the Jews
                did not approach their wives until they made <pb type="external" n="87"/>a feast to
                the high priest, and then they took them. And <persName>Joseph</persName> thought that he would put her
                away secretly; and while he was pondering these things in his heart, the angel of
                the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said, <quote><persName>Joseph</persName>, son of <persName>David</persName>, fear not
                to take <persName>Mary</persName> thy wife; for that which is born in her is of the Holy Spirit.</quote> He
                spake well when he said <quote>in her,</quote> and not <quote>of her.</quote></p>
            <p>And the priests heard of <persName>Mary</persName>’s conception, and they made an accusation against
                <persName>Joseph</persName>, as if deceit had been found in him. <persName>Joseph</persName> said, <quote>As the Lord liveth, I
                know not the cause of her conception;</quote> and <persName>Mary</persName> likewise swore this. There was a

                they made him drink <quote>the water of trial;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n79-1"/> if he were innocent, he was not
                hurt, but if he were guilty, his belly swelled, and his body became swollen, and the

                of the water of trial, and they were not hurt, the high priest commanded <persName>Joseph</persName> to

            <p>One year before the annunciation of <persName>our Lord</persName>, the emperor of the Romans sent to the

                one for the poll-tax, for the Jews were subject to the empire or the Romans; and
                every man was written down in his city. And <pb type="external" n="88"/><persName>Joseph</persName> the
                carpenter also went up that he might be written down in his city; and by reason of
                his exceeding great watchfulness for the blessed (<persName>Mary</persName>), he took her with him upon
                an ass. When they had gone about three miles, <persName>Joseph</persName> looked at her and saw that
                her hand was laid upon her belly, and that her face was contracted with pain; and he
                thought that she was troubled by the beast, and asked her about her trouble and
                pain. She said to him, <quote>Hasten and prepare a place for me to alight, for the pains
                of childbirth have taken hold upon me.</quote> When he had lifted her down from the animal,
                he went to fetch a midwife, and found a Hebrew woman whose name was

                the child wrapped in swaddling clothes and rags, and laid in a crib. And there were
                shepherds there keeping watch over their flocks, and behold the angel of God came to
                them, and the glory of the Lord shone upon them; and they feared with an exceeding
                great fear. The angel said to them, <quote>Fear not, for behold, I announce to you a great
                joy which shall be to all the world; for there is born to you this day a Redeemer,
                who is the <persName>Lord Jesus</persName>, in the city <pb type="external" n="89"/>of <persName>David</persName>: and

                earth peace and tranquillity and good hope to men.</quote> And the shepherds went and
                entered the cave, and they saw as the angel had said to them. The names of the

            <p>Some say that that star appeared to the Magi simultaneously with the birth of <persName>our
                Lord</persName>. As for <persName>Herod</persName>’s commanding that all children from two years old and
                downwards should be slain, it is not as if they required all that length of time for
                their journey, but they had some accidental delay either in their own country or on
                the road. Again, <persName>Herod</persName> did not command that the children should be slain
                immediately after his having met the Magi, but much time passed in the interval,
                because he was waiting to hear from them.</p>
            <p>The holy <persName>Mâr John Chrysostom</persName>, in his exposition of Matthew, says, <pb n="83"/><quote>The
                star appeared a long time before,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-1"/> for their journey was accomplished with
                great delay that they might come to the end of it on the day of <persName>our Lord</persName>’s birth.
                It was meet that He should be worshipped in swaddling bands, that the greatness of
                the wonder might be recognised; therefore the star appeared to them a long time
                before. For if the star had appeared to them in the east when He was born in
                <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, they would not have been able to see Him in swaddling bands. Marvel
                not, if <persName>Herod</persName> slew the children from two years and downwards, for wrath and fear
                urged him to increased watchfulness; therefore he added more time than was needful,
                that no one should be able to escape.</quote></p>
            <p>As touching the nature of that star, whether it was a star in its nature, or in
                appearance only, it is right to know that it was not of the other stars, but a
                secret power which appeared like a star; for all the other stars that are <pb
                    type="external" n="92"/>in the firmament, and the sun and moon, perform their
                course from east to west. This one, however, made its course from north to south,
                for <placeName>Palestine</placeName> lies thus, over against <placeName>Persia</placeName>. This star was not seen by them at
                night only, but also during the day, and at noon; and it was seen at the time when
                the sun is particularly strong, because it was not one of the stars.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-2"/> Now the
                moon is stronger in its light than all the stars, but it is immediately quenched and
                its light dissipated by one small ray of the sun. But this star overcame even the
                beams of the sun by the intensity of its light. Sometimes it <pb n="84"/>appeared,
                and sometimes it was hidden entirely. It guided the Magi as far as <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. When
                they drew near to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, it was hidden; and when they went forth from <persName>Herod</persName>,
                and began to journey along the road, it appeared and shewed itself. This was not an
                ordinary movement of the stars, but a rational power. Moreover, it had no fixed
                path, but when the Magi travelled, it travelled on also, and when they halted, it
                also halted; like the pillar of cloud which stopped and went forward when it was
                convenient for the camp of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. The star did not remain always up in the height
                of heaven, but sometimes it came down and sometimes it mounted up; and it also stood
                over the head of the Child, as the Evangelist tells us.</p>

                <persName>Artabân</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-2"/> and <persName>Hôrmîzdâd</persName> the son of <persName>Sîṭârûḳ</persName> (<persName>Sanṭarôḳ</persName>), <persName>Gûshnâsâph</persName>
                (<persName>Gushnasp</persName>) the son of <persName>Gûndaphar</persName>, and <persName>Arshakh</persName> the son of <persName>Mîhârôḳ</persName>; these four
                brought gold. <persName>Zarwândâd</persName> the son of <persName>Warzwâd</persName>, <persName>Îryâhô</persName> the son of <persName>Kesrô</persName>
                (<persName>Khosrau</persName>), <persName>Arṭaḥshisht</persName> the son of <persName>Ḥolîtî</persName>, <persName>Ashtônʿâbôdan the son of
                    <persName>Shîshrôn</persName></persName>; these four brought myrrh. <persName>Mêhâroḳ</persName> the son of <persName>Ḥûhâm</persName>, <persName>Aḥshîresh</persName> the
                son of <pb n="85"/><persName>Haṣbân</persName>, <persName>Ṣardâlâḥ</persName> the son of <persName>Baladân</persName>, <persName>Merôdâch</persName> the son of
                <persName>Beldarân</persName>; these four brought frankincense. Some say that the offerings which the
                Magi brought and offered to <persName>our Lord</persName> had been laid in <placeName>the Cave of Treasures</placeName> by
                <persName>Adam</persName>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85-1"/> and <persName>Adam</persName> commanded <persName>Seth</persName> to hand them down from one to another
                until <persName>our Lord</persName> rose, and they brought (them), and offered (them) to Him. But this
                is not received by the Church. When the Magi came to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, the whole city was
                moved; and <persName>Herod</persName> the king heard it and was moved. And he gathered together the
                chief priests and the scribes of the people, and enquired about the place in which
                <persName>Christ</persName> should be born; and they told him, in <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName> of <placeName>Judah</placeName>, <pb
                    type="external" n="94"/>for so it is written in the prophet.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85-2"/> Then
                <persName>Herod</persName> called the Magi, and flattered them, and commanded them to seek out the
                Child diligently, and when they had found Him to tell <persName>Herod</persName>, that he also might go
                and worship Him. When the Magi went forth from <persName>Herod</persName>, and journeyed along the
                road, the star rose again suddenly, and guided them until it came and stood over
                (the place) where the Child was. And when they entered the cave, and saw the Child
                with <persName>Mary</persName> His mother, they straightway fell down and worshipped Him, and opened
                their treasures, and offered unto Him offerings, gold and myrrh and frankincense.
                Gold for His kingship, and myrrh for His burial, and frankincense for His Godhead.
                And it was revealed to them in a dream that they should not return to <persName>Herod</persName>, and
                they went to their land by another way. Some say that the Magi took some of <persName>our
                Lord</persName>’s swaddling bands with them as a blessed thing.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85-3"/></p>

            <p>Then <persName>Longinus the sage</persName> wrote to <persName>Augustus Caesar</persName> and said to him, <quote>Magians, kings

                whose son he is, is not known to us.</quote> <persName>Augustus Caesar</persName> wrote to <persName>Longinus</persName>, saying,
                <quote>Thou hast acted wisely in that thou hast made known to us (these things) and hast
                not hidden (them) from us.</quote> He wrote also to <persName>Herod</persName>, and asked him to let him know
                the story of the Child. When <persName>Herod</persName> had made enquiries about the Child, and saw
                that he had been mocked by the Magi, he was wroth, and sent and slew all the
                children in <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName> and its borders, from two years old and downwards, according
                to the time which he had enquired of the Magi. The number of the children whom he
                slew was two thousand, but some say one thousand eight hundred. When <persName>John</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86-1"/>
                the son of <persName>Zechariah</persName> was sought for, his father took him and brought him before
                the altar; and he laid his hand upon him, and bestowed on him the priesthood, and
                then brought him out into the wilderness. When they could not find <persName>John</persName>, they slew
                <persName>Zechariah</persName> his father between the steps<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86-2"/> and the altar. They say that from
                the day when <persName>Zechariah</persName> was slain his blood bubbled up until <persName>Titus</persName> the son of
                <persName>Vespasian</persName> came and slew three hundred myriads of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and then the flow of

                him round, and laid him under a fig-tree; and he was saved from slaughter. Hence
                <persName>our Lord</persName> said to <persName>Nathaniel</persName>, <quote>Before Philip called thee, I saw thee, when thou

                When they reached the gate of the city called Hermopolis,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87-1"/> there were by the
                two buttresses of the gate two figures of brass, that had been made by the sages and

                entered <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, that is to say that city, these two figures cried out with a loud

                <placeName>Egypt</placeName> heard this, he was troubled and moved; for he feared lest his kingdom should

                that they were from the land of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, he was sorry for them, and came to the
                king and pledged himself for the Child. And he said to the king, <quote>O king, live for
                ever! If deceit be found in this Child, behold, I am before thee, do unto me
                according to thy will.</quote> This is the (cause) of the love between <persName>Lazarus</persName> and
                <persName>Christ</persName>. One day when <persName>Mary</persName> was washing the <pb n="88"/>swaddling bands of <persName>our

                some of it is thrown upon water, it sinks to the bottom; and if a drop of it is
                dropped upon the hollow of a man’s hand, it goes through to the other side. <persName>Our
                Lord</persName> remained two years in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, until <persName>Herod</persName> had died an evil death. He died
                in this manner. First of all he slew his wife and his daughter, and he killed one
                man of every family, saying, <quote>At the time of my death there shall be mourning and
                weeping and lamentation in the whole city.</quote> His bowels and his legs were swollen
                with running sores, and matter flowed from them, and he was consumed by worms. He
                had nine wives and thirteen children. And he commanded his sister <persName>Salome</persName> and her
                husband, saying, <quote>I know that the Jews will hold a great festival on the day of my
                death; when they are gathered together <pb type="external" n="98"/>with the weepers
                and mourners, slay them, and let them not live after my death.</quote> There was a knife in
                his hand, and he was eating an apple; and by reason of the severity of his pain, he
                drew the knife across his throat, and cut it with his own hand; and his belly burst
                open,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88-2"/> and he died and went to perdition. After the death of <persName>Herod</persName> who slew
                the children, his son <persName>Herod Archelaus</persName> reigned, who cut off the head of <persName>John</persName>. And
                the angel of the Lord appeared to <persName>Joseph</persName> in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and said to him, <quote>Arise, take

                gone up from the water, He saw that the heavens were rent, and the Spirit like a
                dove descended upon Him, and a voice from heaven said, <quote>This is My beloved Son, in
                whom I am well pleased.</quote> On this day the Trinity was revealed to men; by the Father
                who cried out, and by the Son who was baptised, and by the Holy Spirit which came

                <persName>Philip</persName>’s wife, he seized <persName>John</persName>, and cast him into the prison called

                came in and danced before the guests; and she was pleasing in the sight of <persName>Herod</persName>

                and said to her, <quote>What shall I ask of him?</quote> She said to her, <quote>The head of <persName>John the

                her daughter would be free from the reprover, and would have an opportunity to
                indulge their lust: for <persName>Herod</persName> committed adultery with the mother and with her
                daughter. Then she went in to the king’s presence and said to him, <quote>Give me now the

                forsooth, he was not delighted at the murder of the saint; but by reason of the
                force and compulsion of the oath he was obliged to cut off <persName>John</persName>’s head. If, O

                thy kingdom, that she might sit upon the throne beside thee and divide (it) with
                thee, wouldst thou have acceded to her, and not have falsified thy oath, O crafty
                one? And the king commanded an executioner, and he cut off the head of the blessed
                man, and he put it in a charger and brought and gave it to the damsel, and the
                damsel gave it to her mother. Then she went out to dance upon the ice, and it opened
                under her, and she sank into the water up to her neck; and no one was able to
                deliver her. And they brought the sword with which <persName>John</persName>’s head had been cut off,
                and cut off hers and carried it to <persName>Herodias</persName> her mother. When she saw her
                daughter’s head and that of the holy man, she became blind, and her right hand, with
                which she had taken up John’s head, dried up; and <pb n="91"/>her tongue dried up,
                because she had reviled him, and <persName>Satan</persName> entered into her, and she was bound with
                fetters. Some say that the daughter of Herodias was called <persName>Bôzîyâ</persName>, but others say
                that she also was called by her mother’s name <persName>Herodias</persName>. When <persName>John</persName> was slain, his

                <persName>Jesus</persName>. The two disciples whom <persName>John</persName> sent to <persName>our Lord</persName>, saying, <quote>Art thou He that

                the mighty deeds that He wrought<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91-4"/></head>
            <p>Two days after His baptism, He chose eight of the twelve disciples; and on the third
                day He changed the water into wine in the city of <placeName>Cana</placeName>. After He went forth from
                the wilderness, He completed the number of the twelve, according to the number of
                the tribes of the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> and according to the number of the months.
                After the twelve disciples, He chose seventy and two, according to the number of the
                seventy-two elders. When He went out to the desert after He had changed the water
                into wine, He fasted forty days and forty nights. <pb n="92"/>Some say that <persName>our
                Lord</persName> and the devil were waging war with one another for forty days; others say that
                the three contests took place in one day. After He had conquered the devil by the
                power of His Godhead, and had given us power to conquer him, He began to teach the
                nations. He wrought miracles, <pb type="external" n="103"/>healed the sick, cleansed
                the lepers, cast out devils, opened the eyes of the blind, made the lame walk, made
                cripples stand, gave hearing to the deaf, and speech of tongue to the dumb. He
                satisfied five thousand with five loaves, and there remained twelve basketfuls; and
                with seven loaves and two fishes He satisfied four thousand (men), besides women and
                children, and there remained seven basketfuls. And some writers say that <persName>our Lord</persName>
                satisfied forty thousand men and women and children with five loaves. He walked upon
                the water and the sea as upon dry land. He rebuked the sea when it was disturbed,
                and it ceased from its disturbance. He raised up four dead; the daughter of
                <persName>Jairus</persName>, the widow’s son, the servant of the centurion, and His friend <persName>Lazarus</persName>
                after (he had been dead) four days. He subjected Himself to the ancient law of
                <persName>Moses</persName>, that it might not be thought He was opposed to the divine commandments; and
                when the time came for Him to suffer, and to draw nigh to death that He might make
                us live by His death, and to slay sin in His flesh, and to fulfil the prophecies
                concerning Him, first of all He kept the Passover of the law; He dissolved the old
                covenant, and then He laid the foundation for the new law by His own Passover.</p>

            <p>When the time of the Passover came, He sent two of His disciples to a man with whom
                they were not acquainted, saying, <quote>When ye enter <pb type="external" n="104"/>the
                city, behold, there will meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him, and
                wheresoever he entereth, say ye to the master of the house, <quote>Our Master saith. Where
                is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?</quote> and behold,
                he will shew you a large upper chamber made ready and prepared; there make ye ready
                    <pb n="93"/>for us.</quote> And because at that time crowds of people were flocking
                thickly into <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> to keep the feast of the Passover, so that all the houses
                of the inhabitants of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> were filled with people by reason of the great
                crowd which was resorting thither, <persName>our Lord</persName>, by the power of His Godhead, worked
                upon the master of the house to make ready a large upper chamber without his being
                aware for whom he was preparing it, but he thought that perhaps some great man among
                the nobles and grandees of the Jews was about to come to him, and that it was right
                to keep a room for him furnished with all things (needful); because all those who
                came from other places to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> were received into their houses by the people
                of the city, and whatsoever they required for the use of the feast of the Passover
                they supplied. Hence the master of the house made ready that upper chamber with all
                things (needful), and permitted no man to enter therein, being restrained by the
                power of <persName>our Lord</persName>. Because a mystical thing was about to be done in it, it was not
                meet for Him to perform the hidden mystery when others were near. <pb

                They were not all made perfect, because they were not all pure, for <persName>Judas</persName>, the son

            <p>Three years and three months after His baptism, <persName>Judas Iscariot</persName> the son of <persName>Simon</persName>
                betrayed his Lord to death. He was called <persName>Iscariot</persName> (<persName>Sĕkhariôṭa</persName>) from the name of
                his town (<placeName>Sĕkhariôṭ</placeName>), and he had the sixth place among the disciples before he
                betrayed <persName>our Lord</persName>. <persName>Our Lord</persName> was crucified at the third hour of Friday, the ninth
                of Nisan. <persName>Caiaphas</persName>, who condemned <persName>our Lord</persName>, is <persName>Josephus</persName>. The name of
                <persName>Bar-Abbâ</persName> was <persName>Jesus</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n94-2"/> The name of the soldier who pierced <persName>our Lord</persName> with
                the spear, and spat in His face, and smote Him on His cheek, was <persName>Longinus</persName>; it was
                he who lay upon a sick bed for thirty-eight years, and <persName>our Lord</persName> healed him, and
                said to him, <quote>Behold, thou art healed; sin no more, lest something worse than the
                first befall thee.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n94-3"/> The watchers at the grave were five, and these are their
                names: <persName>Issachar</persName>, <persName>Gad</persName>, <persName>Matthias</persName>, <persName>Barnabas</persName> and <persName>Simon</persName>; but others say they
                were fifteen, three centurions and their Roman and Jewish soldiers. Some men have a
                tradition that the stone which was laid upon the grave of <persName>our Lord</persName> was the stone
                which poured out water for the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> in the wilderness. The grave in
                which <persName>our Redeemer</persName> was laid was prepared for <persName>Joshua the son of <persName>Num</persName></persName>, and was
                carefully guarded by the Divine will for the burial of <persName>our Lord</persName>. The purple which
                they put on <persName>our Lord</persName> mockingly, <pb type="external" n="107"/>was given in a
                present to the Maccabees by the emperors of the Greeks; and they handed it over to
                the priests for dressing the <pb n="95"/>temple.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95-1"/> The priests took it and
                brought it to <persName>Pilate</persName>, testifying and saying, <quote>See the purple which He prepared
                when He thought to become king.</quote> The garment which the soldiers divided into four
                parts indicates the passibility of His body. The robe without seam at the upper end
                which was not rent, is the mystery of the Godhead which cannot admit suffering. As
                touching the blood and water which came forth from His side,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95-2"/> <persName>John the son of <persName>Zebedee</persName></persName> was deemed worthy to see that vivifying flow from the life-giving
                fountain. <persName>Mâr John Chrysostom</persName> says: <quote>When His side was rent by the soldiers with
                the spear, there came forth immediately water and blood. The water is a type of
                baptism, and the blood is the mystery of His precious blood, for baptism was given
                first, and then the cup of redemption. But in the gospel it is written, <quote>There went
                forth blood and water</quote>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95-3"/></quote> As to the tree upon which <persName>our Redeemer</persName> was
                crucified, some have said that He was crucified upon those bars with which they
                carried the ark of the covenant; and others that it was upon the wood of the tree on
                which <persName>Abraham</persName> offered up the ram as an offering instead of <persName>Isaac</persName>. His hands were
                nailed upon the wood of the fig-tree of which <persName>Adam</persName> ate, and behold, we have
                mentioned its history with that of <persName>Moses</persName>’ rod. The thirty pieces of silver (zûzê)
                which <persName>Judas</persName> received, and for which he sold his Lord, were thirty pieces according
                to the weight of the sanctuary, and were equal to six hundred pieces according to
                the weight of our country[#95-4]. <pb type="external" n="108"/><persName>Terah</persName>[#95-5] made
                these pieces for <persName>Abraham</persName> his son; <persName>Abraham</persName> gave them to <persName>Isaac</persName>; <persName>Isaac</persName> bought a
                village with them; the owner of the village carried them to Pharaoh; Pharaoh sent
                them to <persName>Solomon</persName> the son of <pb n="96"/><persName>David</persName> for the building of his temple; and
                <persName>Solomon</persName> took them and placed them round about the door of the altar. When
                <persName>Nebuchadnezzar</persName> came and took captive the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, and went into
                <persName>Solomon</persName>’s temple and saw that these pieces were beautiful, he took them, and
                brought them to <placeName>Babylon</placeName> with the captives of the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>. There were
                some Persian youths there as hostages, and when <persName>Nebuchadnezzar</persName> came from
                <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, they sent to him everything that was meet for kings and rulers. And
                since gifts and presents had been sent by the Persians, he released their sons and
                gave them gifts and presents, among which were those pieces of silver about which we
                have spoken; and they carried them to their parents. When <persName>Christ</persName> was born and they
                saw the star, they arose and took those pieces of silver and gold and myrrh and
                frankincense, and set out on the journey; and they came to the neighbourhood of
                <placeName>Edessa</placeName>, and these kings fell asleep by the roadside. And they arose and left the
                pieces behind them, and did not remember them, but forgot that anything of theirs
                remained behind. And certain merchants came and found them, and took these pieces,
                and came to the neighbourhood of <placeName>Edessa</placeName>, and sat down by a well of water. On that
                very day an angel came to the shepherds, and gave them the garment without seam <pb
                    type="external" n="109"/>at the upper end, woven throughout. And he said to
                them, <quote>Take this garment, in which is the life of mankind.</quote> And the shepherds took
                the garment, and came to the well of water by the side of which were those
                merchants. They said to them, <quote>We have a garment without seam at the upper end; will
                ye buy it?</quote> The merchants said to them, <quote>Bring it here.</quote> When they saw the garment,
                they marvelled and said to the shepherds: <quote>We have thirty pieces of silver which are
                meet for kings; take them and give us this garment.</quote> When the merchants had taken
                the garment, and had gone into the city of <placeName>Edessa</placeName>, <persName>Abgar the king</persName> sent to them
                and said, <quote>Have ye anything meet for kings, that I may buy it from you?</quote> The
                merchants said to him, <quote>We have a garment without seam at the upper end.</quote> When the
                king saw the garment, he said to them, <quote>Whence have ye this garment?</quote> They said to
                him, <quote>We came to a well by the gate of thy city, and we saw it in the hands of some
                shepherds, and we bought it from them for thirty pieces of stamped silver, which
                were also meet for kings like thyself.</quote> The king sent for <pb n="97"/>the shepherds,
                and took the pieces from them, and sent them together with the garment to <persName>Christ</persName>
                for the good that He had done him in healing his sickness. When <persName>Christ</persName> saw the
                garment and the pieces, He kept the garment by Him, but He sent the pieces to the
                Jewish treasury. When <persName>Judas Iscariot</persName> came to the chief priests and said to them,
                <quote>What will ye give me that I may deliver Him to you?</quote> <pb type="external" n="110"
                />the priests arose and brought those pieces, and gave them to <persName>Judas Iscariot</persName>; and
                when he repented, he returned them to the Jews, and went and hanged himself. And the
                priests took them and bought with them a field for a burial-place for strangers.</p>

                <persName>Simon Peter</persName> did not recognise Him was because he had denied Him, and was ashamed
                to look upon Him; but <persName>John</persName>, because of his frank intimacy with <persName>our Lord</persName>,
                immediately that he saw Him, knew Him. Ninthly, when He was taken up to heaven from

            <head>Of the Ascension of <persName>our Lord</persName> to Heaven<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n100-7"/></head>
            <p>After <persName>our Redeemer</persName> had risen from the grave, and had gone about in the world forty
                days, He appeared to His disciples ten times, and ate and drank with them by the
                side of the <placeName>Sea of Tiberias</placeName>. At this point the heathen say to us, that if <persName>our
                Lord</persName> really ate and drank after His resurrection, there will certainly be eating
                and drinking after (our) resurrection; but if He did not really eat and drink, then
                all the actions of <persName>Christ</persName> are mere phantasms. To these we make answer, that this
                    <pb type="external" n="113"/>world is a world of need for food; therefore He ate
                and drank, that it might not be thought He was a phantom; and because many who have
                risen from the dead have eaten and drunk in (this) world until they departed and
                died, as, for example, the dead (child) whom <persName>Elisha</persName> raised, and the dead whom <persName>our
                Lord</persName> raised. <persName>Our Lord</persName> did not eat after His resurrection because He needed food,
                but only to make certain His humanity: for, behold,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n100-8"/> He once remained in the
                desert forty days <pb n="101"/>without food, and was not injured by hunger. Some say
                that after His resurrection <persName>our Lord</persName> ate food like unto that which the angels ate
                in the house of <persName>Abraham</persName>, and that the food was dissipated and consumed by the
                Divine Power, just as fire licks up oil without any of it entering into its
                substance. <persName>Our Lord</persName> remained upon the earth forty days, even as He had fasted
                forty days, and as <persName>Elijah</persName> fasted forty days, and as <persName>Moses</persName> fasted forty days at
                two several times, and as the rain continued for forty days during the flood, and as
                God admonished the Ninevites for forty days, and as the spies remained (absent) for
                forty days, and as the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> wandered about in the wilderness for
                forty years, and like the child whose fashioning in the womb is completed in forty
                days. After forty days, <persName>our Lord</persName> took up <pb type="external" n="114"/>His
                disciples to the <placeName>Mount of Olives</placeName>, and laid His hand upon them, and blessed them,
                and commanded them concerning the preaching and teaching of the nations. And it came
                to pass that while He was blessing them, He was separated from them, and went up to
                heaven; and they worshipped Him. And there appeared to them angels, encouraging them
                and saying, <quote>This <persName>Jesus</persName>, who has been taken up from you to heaven, is about to
                come again even as ye have seen Him go up to heaven.</quote> Then they returned to that
                upper chamber where they were, and stayed there ten days, until they received the
                Holy Spirit in the form of tongues of fire. <persName>Simon Peter</persName> said to his
                fellow-disciples, <quote>It is right for us to put some one in the place of <persName>Judas</persName> to
                complete the number of twelve;</quote> and they cast lots, and the lot fell upon
                <persName>Matthias</persName>, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n101-1"/></p>
            <p>As concerning the manner in which <persName>our Lord</persName> entered heaven without cleaving it, some
                say that He went in as He did through the closed doors; and as He came forth from
                the virgin womb, and <persName>Mary</persName>’s virginity returned to its former state; and like the
                sweat from the body; and as water is taken up by the roots of the olive and other
                trees, and reaches in the twinkling of an eye the leaves, flowers and fruits, as if
                through certain ducts, without holes or channels being pierced in them. Thus by an
                infinite and ineffable miracle <persName>our Lord</persName> entered into heaven without cleaving it.
                And if the bodies of us who are accustomed <pb type="external" n="115"/><pb n="102"
                />to drink water and wine pour out sweat without our flesh being rent or our skin
                pierced, how very much easier is it for the Divine Power to go in through closed
                doors and within the firmament of heaven without rending or cleaving it?</p>
            <p><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n102-1"/>As regards the upper chamber in which <persName>our Lord</persName> held His Passover, some say
                that it belonged to <persName>Lazarus</persName>, and others to <persName>Simon the Cyrenian</persName>, and others to
                <persName>Joseph the senator</persName>; but <persName>Joshua the son of <persName>Nun</persName></persName>, the Catholicus,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n102-2"/> says
                that it belonged to <persName>Nicodemus</persName>. The apostles remained in the upper chamber ten days
                after the Ascension, being constant in fasting and prayer, and expecting the Spirit,
                the Comforter, which <persName>our Lord Jesus Christ</persName> promised them.</p>

            <head>Of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles in the upper

            <p>Ten days after <persName>our Lord</persName>’s Ascension, when the holy apostles were assembled in the
                upper chamber waiting for the promise of <persName>our Lord</persName>, of a sudden, at the third hour
                of the holy Sunday of Pentecost, a mighty sound was heard, so that all men were
                terrified and marvelled at the mightiness of the sound; and the chamber was filled
                with an ineffably strong light. And there appeared over the head of each one of them
                (something) in the form of tongues of fire, and there breathed forth from thence a
                sweet odour which surpassed all aromas in this world. The eyes of their hearts were
                opened, and they began interpreting new things and uttering wonderful things in the
                languages of all nations. <pb type="external" n="116"/>When the Jews saw them, they
                thought within themselves that they had been drinking new wine and were drunk, and
                that their minds were depraved. On that day they participated in the mystery of the
                body and blood of <persName>our Lord</persName>, and sanctified the leavened bread of the sign of the
                cross (the eucharistic wafers) and the oil of baptism.</p>
            <p>Some men have a tradition that when <persName>our Lord</persName> broke His body for <pb n="103"/>His
                disciples in the upper chamber, <persName>John the son of <persName>Zebedee</persName></persName> hid a part of his
                portion until <persName>our Lord</persName> rose from the dead. And when <persName>our Lord</persName> appeared to His
                disciples and to <persName>Thomas</persName> with them, He said to <persName>Thomas</persName>, <quote>Hither with thy finger
                and lay it on My side, and be not unbelieving, but believing.</quote> <persName>Thomas</persName> put his
                finger near to <persName>our Lord</persName>’s side, and it rested upon the mark of the spear, and the
                disciples saw the blood from the marks of the spear and nails. And <persName>John</persName> took that
                piece of consecrated bread, and wiped up that blood with it; and the Easterns, <persName>Mâr
                Addai</persName> and <persName>Mâr Mari</persName>, took that piece, and with it they sanctified this unleavened
                bread which has been handed down among us.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n103-1"/> The other disciples did not take
                any of it, because they said, <quote>We will consecrate for ourselves whenever we wish.</quote>
                As for the oil of baptism, some say that it was part of the oil with which they
                anointed the kings; others say that it was part of the unguent wherewith they
                embalmed <persName>our Lord</persName>; and many agree with this (statement). Others again say that
                when <persName>John</persName> took that piece of consecrated bread of the Passover in his hand, it
                burst into flame and burnt in the palm of his hand, and the palm of his hand
                sweated, and he took that sweat and hid it for the sign of the cross of baptism.
                This account we have heard by ear from the mouth of a recluse and visitor
                (περιοδευτής), and we have not received it from Scripture. <pb type="external"

                He first preached in <placeName>Antioch</placeName>, and built there the first of all churches, which was
                in the house of <persName>Cassianus</persName>, whose son he restored to life. He remained there one
                year, and there the disciples were called Christians. From thence he went to <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
                where he remained for twenty-seven years; and in the three hundred and seventy-sixth

                built in it a church. Three of his disciples went with him: <persName>Ignatius</persName>, who was
                afterwards bishop of <placeName>Antioch</placeName>, and who was thrown to the beasts in <placeName>Rome</placeName>;

                where the slain were buried, he found <persName>Paul</persName>’s head, and took it upon the top of his
                staff, and laid it by his sheep-fold. At night he saw a fire blazing over it, and he
                went in (to the city) and informed the holy bishop <persName>Xystus</persName> (<persName>Sixtus</persName>) and the
                clergy of the church; and they all recognised that it was <persName>Paul</persName>’s head. <persName>Xystus</persName>
                said to them, <quote>Let us watch and pray the whole night, and let us bring out the body
                and lay the head at its feet; and if it joins again to its neck, it will be certain
                that it is <persName>Paul</persName>’s.</quote> And when they had done so, the whole body was restored, and
                the head was joined to its neck as if the vertebrae had never been severed; and
                those who saw it were amazed and glorified God. From his call to the end of his life
                was thirty-five years; he went about in every place for thirty-one years; for two
                years he was in prison at <placeName>Caesarea</placeName>, and for two years at <placeName>Rome</placeName>. He was martyred
                in the thirty-sixth year after the Passion of <persName>our Lord</persName>, and was laid with great

                one of the former generations. They are mad with drunkenness and anger and shameless

                may be polluted by the sons of pollution, and men may be subjected to the yoke of
                tribute; then shall men sell everything that they have and give it to them, but

                they spare the miserable; they will not relieve the afflicted; they will smite the

                who frame laws, and the little shall be esteemed as the great, and the despised as

                there is none who shall be able to change the persuasive force of their words. The

                north to south, and to <placeName>the wilderness of Yathrib</placeName>. In their latter days there shall
                be great tribulation, old men and old women hungering and thirsting, and tortured in

                priests and deacons in the sanctuary, and they will lie with their wives in the
                houses of God. They will make clothes for themselves and their wives out of the holy
                vestments, and they will spread them upon their horses, and work impurity upon them
                in their beds. They will bring their cattle into the churches and altars, and they
                will tie up their dogs by the shrines of the saints. In those days the spirit of the
                righteous and of them that are well versed in signs will be grieved. The feeble will
                deny the true faith, the holy Cross, and the life-giving mysteries; and without
                compulsion many will deny <persName>Christ</persName>, and become rebels and slanderers and boasters,
                denying the faith. With this chastisement shall the Christians be tried. For at that
                    <pb n="126"/>time the righteous, the humble, the peaceful and the gentle will
                not be sought after, but liars and slanderers and accusers and disturbers and the
                obscene and those who are destitute of mercy, and those who scoff at their parents
                and blaspheme the life-giving mysteries. And the true believers shall come into
                troubles <pb type="external" n="143"/>and persecutions until they despair of their
                lives. Honour shall be taken away from the priests, and the pastors shall become as
                the people. When the measure of their (i.e. the Ishmaelites’) victory is full,
                tribulation will increase, and chastisement will be doubled upon man and beast. And
                there shall be a great famine, and the dead bodies of men shall lie in the streets
                and squares without any one to bury them, and (just) reckoning shall vanish and
                disappear from the earth. And men shall sell their brass and their iron and their
                clothes, and shall give their sons and their daughters willingly to the heathen. A
                man shall lie down in the evening and rise in the morning, and shall find at his
                door two or three exactors and officers to carry off by force;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n126-1"/> and two or

                men are oppressed and beaten, and hunger and thirst, and are tormented by that
                bitter chastisement; while the tyrants shall live luxuriously and enjoy themselves,
                and eat and drink, and boast in the victory they have won, having destroyed nations
                and peoples, and shall adorn themselves like brides, saying, <quote>The Christians have
                neither a God nor a deliverer;</quote> then all of a sudden there shall be raised up
                against them pains like those of a woman in childbirth; and the king of the Greeks
                shall go forth against them in great wrath, and he shall rouse himself like a man
                who has shaken off his wine. He shall go forth against them from <placeName>the sea of the
                Cushites</placeName>, and shall cast the sword and destruction into <placeName>the wilderness of Yathrib</placeName>
                and into the dwelling-place <pb type="external" n="144"/>of their fathers. They
                shall carry off captive their wives and sons and daughters into the service of
                slavery, and fear of all those round about them shall fall upon them, and they shall
                all be delivered into the hand of the king of the Greeks, and shall be given over to
                the sword and to captivity and to slaughter, and their latter subjection shall be
                one hundred times more severe than their <pb n="127"/>(former) yoke. They shall be
                in sore tribulation from hunger and thirst and anxiety; they shall be slaves unto
                those who served them, and bitter shall their slavery be. Then shall the earth which
                has become desolate of its inhabitants find peace, and the remnant that is left
                shall return every man to his own land and to the inheritance of his fathers; and
                men shall increase like locusts upon the earth which was laid waste. <placeName>Egypt</placeName> shall
                be ravaged, <placeName>Arabia</placeName> shall be burnt with fire, the land of <placeName>Hebron</placeName> shall be laid
                waste, and the tongue of the sea shall be at peace. All the wrath and anger of the
                king of the Greeks shall have full course upon those who have denied <persName>Christ</persName>. And
                there shall be great peace on earth, the like of which has not been from the
                creation of the world until its end; for it is the last peace. And there shall be
                great joy on earth, and men shall dwell in peace and quiet; convents and churches
                shall be restored, cities shall be built, the priests shall be freed from taxes, and
                men shall rest from labour and anxiety of heart. They shall eat and drink; there
                shall be neither pain nor care; and they shall marry wives and beget children during
                that true peace. Then shall the gates of the north be opened, and the nations shall

            <head>Of Gôg and Mâgôg, who are imprisoned in the North<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n127-1"/></head>
            <p>When <persName>Alexander</persName> was king and had subdued countries and cities, and had arrived in
                the East, he saw on the confines of the East those men who are of the children of
                <persName>Japhet</persName>. They were more wicked and unclean than all (other) dwellers in the world;
                filthy peoples of hideous appearance, who ate mice and the creeping things of the
                earth and snakes and scorpions. They never buried the bodies of their dead, and they
                ate as dainties the children which women aborted and the after-birth. People
                ignorant of God, and unacquainted with the power of reason, but who lived in this
                world without understanding like ravening beasts. When <persName>Alexander</persName> saw their
                wickedness, he called God to his aid, and he gathered together and brought them and
                their wives and children, and <pb n="128"/>made them go in, and shut them up within
                the confines of the North. This is the gate of the world on the north, and there is
                no other entrance or exit from the confines of the world from the east to the north.
                And <persName>Alexander</persName> prayed to God with tears, and God heard his prayer and commanded
                those two lofty mountains which are called <quote>the children of the north,</quote> and they
                drew nigh to one another until there remained between them about twelve cubits. Then
                he built in front of them a strong building, and he made for it a door of brass, and
                anointed it within and without with oil of Thesnaḳṭîs,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n128-1"/> so that if they
                should bring<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n128-2"/> iron (implements) near it <pb type="external" n="146"/>to
                force it open, they would be unable to move it; and if they wished to melt it with
                fire, it would quench it; and it feared neither the operations of devils nor of
                sorcerers, and was not to be overcome (by them). Now there were twenty-two kingdoms
                imprisoned within the northern gate, and their names are these: Gôg, Mâgôg, Nâwâl,

                consummation, when men are eating and drinking and marrying wives, and women are
                given to husbands; when they are planting vineyards and building buildings, and
                there is neither wicked man nor <pb n="129"/>adversary, on account of the assured
                tranquillity and certain peace; suddenly the gates of the north shall be opened and
                the hosts of the nations that are imprisoned there shall go forth. The whole earth
                shall tremble before them, and men shall flee and take refuge in the mountains and
                in caves and in burial places and in clefts of the earth; and they shall die of
                hunger, and there will be none to bury them, by reason of the multitude of
                afflictions which they will make men suffer. They will eat the flesh of men and
                drink the blood of animals; they will devour the creeping things of the earth, and
                hunt for serpents and scorpions and reptiles that shoot out venom, and eat them.

                will go up and stand upon <placeName>Golgotha</placeName>, where <persName>our Lord</persName> was crucified; and he will
                set the royal crown upon the top of the holy Cross, upon which <persName>our Lord</persName> was <pb

                deliver over the kingdom to God the Father, The holy Cross will be taken up to
                heaven, and the royal crown with it; and the king will die immediately. The king who
                shall deliver over the kingdom to God will be descended from the seed of <persName>Kûshath</persName>
                the daughter of <persName>Pîl</persName>, the king of the Ethiopians; for <persName>Armelaus</persName> (<persName>Romulus</persName>) the

                mingled with that of the Greeks. From this seed shall a king arise who shall deliver
                the kingdom over to God, as the blessed <persName>David</persName> has said, <quote><placeName>Cush</placeName> will deliver the

                to nought, and God will withdraw His providential care from the earth. The heavens
                will be prevented from letting fall rain, and the earth from producing germs and
                plants; and the earth shall remain like iron through drought, and the heavens like
                brass. Then will the son of perdition appear, of the seed and of the tribe of <persName>Dan</persName>;
                and he will shew deluding phantasms, and lead astray the world, for the simple will
                see the lepers cleansed, the blind with their eyes opened, the paralytic walking,
                the devils cast out, the sun when he looks upon it becoming black, the moon when he
                commands it becoming changed, the trees putting forth fruit from their branches, and
                the earth making roots to grow. He will shew deluding phantasms (of this kind), but
                he will not be able to raise the dead. He will go into <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> and will sit upon
                a throne in the temple saying, <quote>I am the Christ;</quote> and he will be borne aloft by
                legions of devils like a king and a lawgiver, naming himself God, and saying, <quote>I am
                the fulfilment of the types and the parables.</quote> He will put an end to prayers and
                offerings, as if at his appearance prayers are to be abolished and men will not need
                sacrifices and offerings along with him. He becomes a man incarnate by a married
                woman of the tribe of <persName>Dan</persName>. When this son of destruction becomes a man, he will be
                made a dwelling-place for devils, and all Satanic workings will be perfected in him.
                There will be gathered together with him all the devils and all the hosts of the

            <p>The foundation of all good and precious things, of all the greatness of God’s gifts,
                of His true love, and of our arriving in His presence, is Death. Men die in five
                ways. Naturally; as <persName>David</persName> said, <quote>Unless his day come and he die,</quote> alluding to
                <persName>Saul</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n131-2"/> Voluntarily; as when <persName>Saul</persName> killed himself in the battle with the
                Philistines. By accident; such as a fall from a roof, and other fatal accidents. By
                violence, from devils and men and wild beasts and venomous reptiles. By (divine)
                chastisement; as the flood in the days of <persName>Noah</persName>, and the fire which fell upon the
                Sodomites, and other such like things. But (side by side) with all these kinds of
                fatalities runs the providence of God’s government, which cannot be comprehended by
                the creatures, restraining (them) where it is meet (to restrain), and letting (them)
                loose where it is fitting (to let loose). This government is not comprehended in
                this world, neither by angels nor by men; but in the world which is to come all
                rational beings will know it. When the soul goes forth from <pb type="external"
                    n="150"/>the body, as <persName>Abbâ Isaiah</persName> says, the angels go with it: then the hosts
                of darkness go forth to meet it, seeking to seize it and examine it, if there be
                anything of theirs in it. Then the angels do not fight with them, but those deeds
                which the soul has wrought protect it and guard it, that they come not near it. If
                its deeds be victorious, then the angels sing praises before it until it meets God
                with joy. In that hour the soul forgets every deed of this world. Consequently, no
                one who does not obtain remission (of sins) in this world can be free from the
                penalty of examination in that day. Not that there is torture or pleasure or
                recompense before the <pb n="132"/>resurrection; but the soul knows everything that
                it has done whether of good or evil.</p>
            <p>As to where the souls abide from the time they leave their bodies until the
                resurrection, some say that they are taken up to heaven, that is, to the region of
                spirit, where the celestial hosts dwell. Others say that they go to Paradise, that
                is, to the place which is abundantly supplied with the good things of the mystery of
                the revelations of God; and that the souls of sinners lie in darkness in the abyss
                of Eden outside Paradise. Others say that they are buried with their bodies; that is
                to say, as the two were buried in God at baptism, so also will they now dwell in Him
                until the day of the resurrection. Others say that they stand at the mouth of the
                graves and await their Redeemer; that is to say, they possess the knowledge of the
                resurrection of their bodies. Others say that they are as it were in a slumber, <pb
                    type="external" n="151"/>because of the shortness of the time; for they point
                out in regard to them that what seems to us a very long time is to them as a
                momentary nod (or wink) in its shortness.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n132-1"/> And just as he that is sunk in
                slumber departs from the life of this world, and yet does not arrive at absolute
                mortality, so also are they in an intermediate knowledge which is higher than that
                of this world, and yet attain not to that which is after the resurrection. Those who
                say that they are like an infant which has no knowledge, shew that they call even
                the knowledge of the truth ignorance in comparison with that knowledge of the truth
                which shall be bestowed upon them after the resurrection.</p>
            <p>That the souls of the righteous pray, and that their prayers assist those who take
                refuge with them, may be learned from many, especially from <persName>Mâr Theodore</persName> in his
                account of the blessed <persName>Thecla</persName>. Therefore it is right for those who have a holy man
                for a friend, to rejoice when he goes to <persName>our Lord</persName> in Paradise, because their
                friend has the power to help them by his prayers. Like the blind disciple of one of
                the saints mentioned in the Book of the Paradise, who, when his master was dying,
                wept bitterly and said, <quote>To whose care dost thou leave the poor blind man?</quote> And his
                master encouraged him, and said to him, <quote>I believe in God that, if I find mercy in
                His sight, at the end of a week thou wilt see;</quote> and <pb n="133"/>after some days he
                did see. The souls of the righteous also hold spiritual conversation with each
                other, according to the Divine permission and command which moves them to this by
                necessary causes. Neither those who have departed this life in the flesh are
                hindered from this (intercourse), <pb type="external" n="152"/>nor those who are
                still clad in their fleshly garments, if they live their life in them holily.</p>

                living sign of <persName>our Lord</persName>’s Cross, honoured and borne aloft in the hands of the
                <persName>Archangel Gabriel</persName>. Its light will overpower the light of the sun, to the reproach
                and putting to shame of the infidels and the crucifying Jews. As soon as the
                life-giving Cross appears before <persName>our Lord</persName>, as <persName>the Doctor</persName> saith, <quote>His victory
                comes before Him,</quote> etc., then a powerful light will fill the whole vaulted space
                between the heavens and the earth, the radiance and light whereof will be above all
                (other) lights; and suddenly will the mighty sound of the first trumpet of the
                Archangel be heard, concerning which <persName>our Lord</persName> said, <quote>At midnight there will be a
                cry, <quote>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet Him</quote>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n133-2"/></quote> At this
                trumpet the sun shall become dark, the moon shall not display its light, the stars
                shall drop from the heavens like leaves, and the powers of the heavens shall be
                moved. The earth shall totter and tremble, the mountains and hills shall melt, the
                sea shall be disturbed and shall cause terrible sounds to be heard. The rivers <pb
                    type="external" n="153"/>shall submerge the earth, the trees shall be uprooted,
                buildings shall fall, towns and villages shall be overturned, and high walls and
                strong towers shall be thrown down. The wild beasts and cattle and fowl and fish
                shall come to an end and perish; and everything shall be destroyed, except a few
                human beings who <pb n="134"/>shall remain alive, and whom the resurrection shall
                overtake, of whom <persName>Paul</persName> has said, <quote>We who are left shall not overtake them that
                sleep,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n134-1"/> meaning to say that those who are found alive at the time of the
                resurrection will not sleep the sleep of death; as the apostle says again, <quote>Behold I
                tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n134-2"/>
                As touching the heavens, some say that they will be rent, and that the waters which
                are above the firmament will descend, for it is not possible for the substance of
                water to pass through the substance of the firmament. Others say that as water
                passes through a tree or a piece of pottery, and sweat through the skin, so also
                will men enter into heaven and not be prevented, and (in like manner too) will the
                waters descend from above. Others say that the firmament will be rolled up like the
                curtain of a tent.</p>
            <p>The second trumpet is that at the sound of which the firmament will be opened, and
                <persName>our Lord</persName> will appear from heaven in splendour and great glory. He will come down
                with the glory of His divinity as far as two-thirds of the distance between the
                firmament and the earth, whither <persName>Paul</persName> ascended in the spirit of
                revelation.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n134-3"/> He will then make an end of the son of perdition, and destroy
                him body and soul, and He will hurl <persName>Satan</persName> and the devils into <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The third trumpet is the last, at which the dead will rise, <pb type="external"
                    n="154"/>and the living be changed, as the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> says, <quote>Swiftly, as in
                the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet when it sounds; and the dead shall rise
                without corruption, and we shall be changed.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n134-4"/> So swiftly and speedily will
                the resurrection of all men be wrought, according to the spiritual nature of the new
                world. For the swiftness of the resurrection will surpass the swiftness of
                understanding, and the spiritual hosts alone see and know in what manner it will
                take place, every man being suddenly found standing in his spirituality. Some men
                therefore have a tradition that the resurrection of the righteous and the just and
                the believers will precede that of other men, who are remote from the true faith;
                but according to the opinion of the truthful and of people generally, the
                resurrection of the <pb n="135"/>whole human race will take place quicker than
                lightning and than the twinkling of an eye; from the generation of <persName>Adam</persName> to the
                latest generation they shall rise at the last trumpet. And though, according to the
                opinion of <persName>the Expositor</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n135-1"/> many sounds will be heard on that night, each
                one of which is a sign of what will happen, yet, according to the consent of the
                greater part of the expositors and of Scripture, three distinct trumpets will sound
                by which the whole work of the resurrection will be completed and finished. <persName>Michael
                the expositor</persName> and exegete, however, says otherwise in the book of
                Questions,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n135-2"/> speaking as follows: <quote>The world will not pass away and be
                dissolved before the vivification of the dead, but the coming of <persName>our Lord</persName> will be
                seen first of all, who will come with the spiritual hosts; and immediately <persName>our
                Lord</persName>’s power will compel the earth to give up the parts of the bodies of men who
                have been slain and have become dust and ashes within it; and there will be a making
                ready and preparation of the souls to receive their bodies all together. If, before
                the vivification of the dead, <pb type="external" n="155"/>the world and all that is
                therein were to pass away, from whence pray would the dead rise? Those who say that
                the world will pass away before the vivification of the dead are fools and
                simpletons; for <persName>Christ</persName> will not make the world pass away before the vivification
                of the dead, but He will first of all raise the dead, and men will see with their
                eyes the passing away of the world, the uprooting of the elements, and the
                destruction of the heavens and the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars; and
                from here sorrow will begin to reign in the mind of the wicked, and endless joy in
                the mind of the righteous.</quote></p>

                resurrection<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n135-3"/></head>
            <p>All classes and conditions of men will rise from the dead in the state of the perfect
                form of <persName>Christ</persName>, about thirty-three years of age, even as <pb n="136"/><persName>our
                Redeemer</persName> rose from the grave. We shall rise with all our limbs perfect, and with
                the same constitutions, without addition or diminution. Some say that the hair and
                nails and prepuce will rise, and some say they will not; as if they were superfluous
                for the completion of the nature of man. Some say concerning the resurrection that a
                likeness only will rise, without parts and without the composition of the limbs of
                man; a mere similitude of hands and feet and hardness of bones. Others say that the
                whole man will be cast into one crystalline substance, and that all his parts will
                be mingled together; and they do not grant him an ordered arrangement of
                composition. Others say that the vessels <pb type="external" n="156"/>which are
                inside the belly, such as the bowels, liver, etc., will not rise; but they err and
                stray from the truth, and do not understand that if one of the parts of the body
                perish, it is not perfect. For <persName>Paul</persName> shewed plainly and laid down an example of the
                resurrection in the grain of wheat: just as that grows up entire with its glory,
                without any portion of it having perished, even so we; for the whole man shall rise
                with all his limbs and parts, and ordered in his composition as now, only having
                acquired purification from the humours. And this is not surprising, that if an
                earthen vessel acquires firmness and lightness when it goes into the fiery furnace,
                without any change taking place in its shape or form, but is lightened of its
                heaviness and density, whilst it preserves its shape uninjured; so also should the
                Holy Spirit burn us in the furnace of the resurrection and drive, forth from us all
                the foul material of the present (life), and clothe us with incorruptibility. <quote>It is
                sown an animal body; it rises a spiritual body.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n136-1"/> We shall neither see nor
                hear with all our bodily members, although some men have thought that the whole man
                will be sight and hearing; but we shall carry out action with these same usual
                limbs, if it happen to be necessary; although we shall not there need speech and
                conversation with one another, because each other’s secrets will be revealed to
                us.</p>
            <p>The things which certain stupid men invent, who indulge their fancy, and give bodily
                form to the punishment of sinners and the reward of the just and righteous, <pb
                    type="external" n="157"/>and say that there is at the resurrection a reckoning
                and a pair of scales, the Church does not receive; but each <pb n="137"/>one of us
                carries his light and his fire within him, and his heaviness and his lightness is
                found in his own nature. Just as stone and iron naturally possess the property of
                falling to the earth, and as the air naturally ascends upward on account of its
                rarity and its lightness; so also in the resurrection, he that is heavy and lying in
                sins, his sins will bring him down; and he that is free from the rust of sin, his
                purity will make him rise in the scale. And <persName>our Lord</persName> will ascend to heaven, and
                the angels (will go) before Him like ambassadors, and the just and the righteous
                will be upon His right hand and His left, and the children behind Him in the form of
                the life-giving Cross.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="59">
            <head>Of the happiness of the righteous and the torment of sinners, and in what state
                they are there<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n137-1"/></head>
            <p>It is right for us to know and explain how those suffer, who suffer in <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>. If
                they do suffer, how can we say that they are impassible? and if they do not suffer,
                then there is no torture for sinners; and if there be no torture for sinners in
                proportion to their sins, neither can there be happiness for the righteous as a
                reward for their labours. The suffering wherewith the Fathers say that sinners will
                suffer in <placeName>Gehenna</placeName> is not one that will pain the limbs, such as the blows of
                sticks, the mutilation of the flesh, and the breaking of the bones, but one that
                will afflict the soul, such as grief for the transgression of what is right,
                repentance for shameful deeds, and banishment from one to whom he is bound <pb
                    type="external" n="158"/>in love and for whom his affection is strong. For in
                the resurrection we shall not be without perception, like the sun which perceives
                not his splendour, nor the moon her brilliancy, nor the pearl its beauty; but by the
                power of reason we shall feel perfectly the delight of our happiness or the keen
                pain of our torture. So then by that which enables the righteous to perceive the
                pleasure of their happiness, by that selfsame thing will the wicked also perceive
                the suffering of their torment; (that is) by the power capable of receiving
                pleasure, which is the intelligence. Hence it is right for us to be certain that
                intelligence will not be taken <pb n="138"/>away from us, but it will receive the
                utmost purification and refinement. The glorious and good things of the world which
                is to come are not to be compared with those of this world; for if all the glorious
                and good things and delights of this world were given to us in the world which is to
                come, we should look upon them as hateful and abominable, and they would not be able
                to give us pleasure or to gladden us; and our nature by the blessedness of its
                immortality would be exalted above all their glory and desirability. And if all the
                torments and afflictions and troubles of this world were brought near to us in the
                world which is to come, the pain of them would make no impression upon our immortal
                and immutable nature. Hence the pleasure of that world is something beyond all
                comparison more glorious and excellent and exalted than those of this world; and the
                torment of yonder is likewise something beyond all comparison more severe and more
                bitter than any that is here.</p>
            <p>It is also right for us to explain the quality of the light of the righteous. The
                light of the righteous is not of a natural origin like this elemental light (of
                ours), but some of the light of <persName>our Lord</persName>—whose splendour surpasses ten thousand
                suns—is diffused and shed upon them. <pb type="external" n="159"/>Each saint shines
                in proportion to his purity, and holiness and refinement and sincerity, as the
                blessed <persName>Paul</persName> has said, <quote>One star surpassed another in glory, so also is the
                resurrection of the dead.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n138-1"/> And although all the saints will be happy in one
                kingdom, yet he who is near to the King or the Bridegroom will be separated from him
                whose place is at the end of the guest-chamber, even though his place be in the same
                chamber. So also with the sinners in <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>; their sentence will not be alike,
                for in proportion to the sin of each will be his torment. And as the light of the
                sun is not to be compared with the light of the moon, nor is the light of the moon
                like that of the stars, so also will the happiness of the righteous be, although the
                name and honour of righteousness be laid upon and spread over all of them. And as
                the light of <persName>our Lord</persName>’s humanity will pass over all our limbs without distinction,
                and take the place of dress and ornament for us, so also with all our members shall
                we perceive the suffering and torment of <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>. The festal garments which <persName>our
                Lord</persName> has prepared for His saints, the children <pb n="139"/>of light, are
                impassibility; and the filthy garments which hinder us from entering into the
                spiritual bridal-chamber are the passions. In the new world there will be no
                distinctive names for ranks and conditions of human beings; and as every name and
                surname attributed to God and the angels had its origin from this world, and names
                for human beings were assigned and distributed by the government of this world, in
                the world of spiritual and intellectual natures there will be <pb type="external"
                    n="160"/>neither names nor surnames among them, nor male nor female, nor slave
                nor free, nor child nor old man, nor Ethiopian nor Roman (Greek); but they will all
                rise in the one perfect form of a man thirty-three years of age, as <persName>our Lord</persName> rose
                from the dead. In the world to come there will be no companies or bands but two; the
                one of the angels and the righteous, who will mingle and form one Church, and the
                other of the devils and sinners in <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>.</p>

            <p>Some of the Fathers terrify us beyond our strength and throw us into despair; and
                their opinion is well adapted to the simple-minded and [trangressors](transgressors)

                opinions are suitable and adapted to the perfect and those of settled minds and the
                pious. In the <quote>Book of Memorials</quote> it is thus written: <quote>This world is the world of
                repentance, but the world which is to come is the world of retribution. As in this
                world repentance saves until the last breath, so in the world to come justice exacts
                to the uttermost farthing. And as it is impossible to see here strict justice
                unmingled with mercy, so it is impossible to find there strict justice mingled with
                mercy.</quote> <pb type="external" n="161"/><persName>Mâr Isaac</persName> says thus: <quote>Those who are to be
                scourged in <placeName>Gehenna</placeName> will be tortured with stripes of <pb n="140"/>love; they who
                feel that they have sinned against love will suffer harder and more severe pangs
                from love than the pain that springs from fear.</quote> Again he says: <quote>The recompense of
                sinners will be this: the resurrection itself will be their recompense instead of
                the recompense of justice; and at the last He will clothe those bodies which have
                trodden down His laws with the glory of perfection. This act of grace to us after we
                have sinned is greater than that which, when we were not, brought our nature into
                being.</quote> Again he says: <quote>In the world which is to come grace will be the judge and
                not justice.</quote> <persName>Mâr Theodore the Expositor</persName> says: <quote>Those who have here chosen fair
                things will receive in the world to come the pleasure of good things with praises;
                but the wicked who have turned aside to evil things all their life, when they are
                become ordered in their minds by penalties and the fear that springs from them, and
                choose good things, and learn how much they have sinned by having persevered in evil
                things and not in good things, and by means of these things receive the knowledge of
                the highest doctrine of the fear of God, and become instructed to lay hold of it
                with a good will, will be deemed worthy of the happiness of the Divine liberality.
                For He would never have said, <quote>Until thou payest the uttermost farthing,</quote> unless it
                had been possible for us to be freed from our sins through having atoned for them by

                and unending happiness is prepared for them. If it be then <pb n="141"/>that the
                rewards of good deeds are as great (in proportion to them) as the times of the
                immortality which are prepared for them are longer<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141-1"/> than the times of the
                limited contests which take place in this world, the torments for many and great
                sins must be very much less than the greatness of mercy. So then it is not for the
                good only that the grace of the resurrection from the dead is intended, but also for
                the wicked; for the grace of God greatly honours the good, but chastises the wicked
                sparingly.</quote></p>
            <p>Again he says: <quote>God pours out the wages of reward beyond the measure of the labours
                (wrought), and in the abundance of His goodness He lessens and diminishes the
                penalty of those <pb type="external" n="163"/>who are to be tormented, and in His
                mercy He shortens and reduces the length of the time. But even thus He does not
                punish the whole time according to (the length of) the time of folly, seeing that He
                requites them far less than they deserve, just as He does the good beyond the
                measure and period (of their deserts); for the reward is everlasting. It has not
                been revealed whether the goodness of God wishes to punish without ceasing the
                blameworthy<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141-2"/> who have been found guilty of evil deeds (or not), as we have
                already said before.</quote> * * * * * * * * *<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141-3"/> But if punishment is to be weighed
                out according to sin, not even so would punishment be endless. For as regards that
                which is said in the Gospel, <quote>These shall go away into everlasting punishment, but
                the righteous into life eternal;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141-4"/> this word <quote>eternal</quote> (lĕ-ʿâlam) is not
                definite: for if it be not so, how did <persName>Peter</persName> say to <persName>our Lord</persName>,'Thou shalt never
                wash my feet,’<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141-5"/> and yet He washed him? And of <placeName>Babylon</placeName> He said, <quote>No man
                shall dwell therein for ever and ever,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n141-6"/> and behold many generations dwell
                therein. In the <quote>Book of Memorials</quote> he says: <quote>I hold what the most celebrated of the
                holy Fathers say, that He cuts off a little from much. The penalty of <placeName>Gehenna</placeName> is a
                man’s mind; for the punishment <pb n="142"/>there is of two kinds, that of the body
                and that of the mind. That of the body is perhaps in proportion to the degree of
                sin, and He lessens and diminishes its duration; but that of the mind is for ever,
                and the judgment is for ever.</quote> But in the New Testament lĕ-ʿâlam is not without end.
                    <pb type="external" n="164"/>To Him be glory and dominion and praise and

On the sixth day, which is Friday, at the first hour, when silence reigned over all the ranks of the (heavenly) hosts, God said, <quote>Come, let us make man in our image after our likeness</quote>—hereby making known concerning the glorious Persons (of the Trinity). When the angels heard these words they were in fear and trembling, saying one to another, <quote>We shall see a great miracle to-day, the likeness of God our Maker</quote>. And they saw the right hand of God stretched out and extended over the whole world; and all created things were collected in the palm of His right hand. And they saw that He took a grain of dust from all the earth, a drop of water from the whole nature of water, a breath of wind from all the atmosphere above, and a little warmth from all the nature of fire. And the angels saw when these four feeble elements—that is, cold and heat and dryness and moisture—were laid in the palm of His right hand, and God formed Adam. For what reason did God make Adam out of these four elements, unless it were that through them everything in the world should be subject unto him? He took a grain of dust, that all natures which are of dust might be subject unto Adam; and a drop of water, that all those in the seas and rivers might be his; and a breath of air, that all kinds of birds of the air might be given unto him; and the heat of fire, that all the fiery beings and (heavenly) hosts might come to his aid. And God formed man with His holy hands, in His image and likeness. When the angels saw his glorious appearance, they trembled at the beauty of his appearance; for they saw the form of his face blazing with glorious beauty like the sphere of the sun, and the light of his eyes was like the sun, and the form of his body like the light of crystal. And when he stretched himself, and stood in the centre of the earth, he set his two feet on the spot where the cross of our Redeemer was placed: for Adam was created in %Jerusalem%, and there it was that he put on royal apparel, and the crown of glory was set upon his head; and there was he made king and priest and prophet, there did God set him upon the throne of His glory, and there He made him master over all creatures. And all beasts and cattle and fowl were gathered together, and they passed before Adam and he gave them names; and they bowed their heads to him, and all natures did homage to him and were subject unto him. And the angels and (heavenly) hosts heard the voice of God saying to him, <quote>Adam, behold I have made thee king and priest and prophet and lord and chief and governor of all things made and created; to thee shall they be subject, and thine shall they be: and I have given thee power over everything that I have created.</quote> And when the angels heard these words, they all blessed and worshipped him.</quote></note>

And Adam and Eve came down from that holy mountain to its skirts below; and there Adam knew Eve his wife. Some say that Adam knew Eve thirty years after they had gone forth from Paradise. And she conceived and bare Cain and Lĕbôdâ his sister with him; and again she conceived and bare Abel and Ḳĕlêmath his sister with him. When the youths had grown up, Adam said to Eve, <quote>Let Cain take to wife Ḳĕlêmath who was born with Abel, and let Abel take Lĕbôdâ who was born with Cain</quote>. But Cain said to Eve his mother, <quote>I will take to wife my own sister, and let Abel take his;</quote> for Lĕbôdâ was beautiful. When Adam heard these words, he was very grieved, and said, <quote>It is a transgression of the law that thou shouldst take to wife thy sister who was born with thee. But take ye of the fruit of the trees and the young of the flocks, and go ye up to the top of this holy mountain, and enter into the Cave of Treasures, and offer up your offerings there, and pray before God, and then be united unto your wives.</quote> And it came to pass that when Adam the first priest, and Cain and Abel his sons, were going up to the top of the mountain, Satan suggested to Cain to slay Abel his brother for the sake of Lĕbôdâ, and because his offering was rejected and not accepted before God, while that of Abel was accepted. And Cain increased his envy against Abel his brother; and when they came down to the plain, Cain stood up against Abel his brother and slew him by a wound from a flint stone.</quote> See Bezold, Die Schatzhöhle, p. 8; Brit.

For when Shem the son of Noah took him away from his parents, not a word was said how old he was when he went up from the east, nor in how many years his departure from this world took place; because he was the son of Mâlâkh, the son of Arphaxar, the son of Shem, and not the son of one of the patriarchs; for the Apostle has said that no one of his father’s family ministered at the altar, and the name of his father is not written down in the genealogies, because Matthew and Luke the Evangelists wrote down the names of the patriarchs only, and hence neither the name of his father nor that of his mother are known.

Now there was in it a certain man who was very rich, and he died about that time. His son made for him an image of gold, and set it up on his grave; and he put a youth to watch it. Then Satan went and dwelt in that image, and he used to speak to the young man in the form of his father. But thieves went in and stole everything which the young man possessed; and he went to his father’s grave weeping. And Satan spake with him, saying, <quote>Weep not before me, but go, bring thy little son, and sacrifice him to me as a sacrifice; and everything which thou hast lost shall be restored to thee immediately.</quote> So he straightway did as Satan commanded him; and he slew his son, and bathed in his blood. Then Satan went forth from the image immediately, and entered into the young man, and taught him magic, incantation, divinations, chaldeeism, destinies, haps, and fates. And behold, from that time men began to sacrifice their children to demons and to worship idols, for the demons went in and dwelt in all the images. In the one hundredth year of Nahor, when God saw that men sacrificed their children to devils, and bowed down to idols, He opened the storehouses of the wind.</quote> Bezold, Die Schatzhöhle, p. 32; Brit.

It then gives the following account of Gamaliel. Gamaliel was a friend of the crucifying Jews, but was afterwards baptised together with his son: he lived for twenty years after this. When they died, they were buried by the side of Nicodemus in Kĕphar Gamlâ, where Stephen was buried. Many years after (about A.D. 415), God revealed their place of burial to one of the saints (Lucian), and they sought for the remains of the bodies by digging, and found them; and there they built a church.
