                  wrote <damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">...</supplied></damage> about
                  interpretations. There after examining the question why the Lord came to baptism
                  when he was 30 years of age in the flesh I said at one time that it was in order
                  to show that the new birth begets men full-grown in reasonable age, for so also
                  the first man was created full-grown, and immediately as full-grown received a
                  commandment and a law, and was given permission to till and keep Paradise, and the
                  words which follow<note type="footnote" n="113" resp="#ebrooks">Mai, Class. Auct.,
                     X, 415. The 2nd reason is not in the printed text.</note>; and at another that
                  by means of three periods comprised in three decads which make 30 years he
                  signified the mystery that was revealed on the Jordan, that one Godhead is made
                  known in three complete hypostases, by which holy baptism in the Father and the
                  Son and the Holy Spirit was to be performed. That these things introduce no
                  confusion Gregory the Theologian in the sermon on the Passover states as follows:
                  "The Lord's passion<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Greg. <foreign
                        xml:lang="grc">πάσχα</foreign>, which the translator has
                     misunderstood.</note>, the passion<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Greg.
                        <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάσχα</foreign>, which the translator has
                     misunderstood.</note>, and again I say the passion<note type="footnote" n="114"
                     >Greg. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάσχα</foreign>, which the translator has
                     misunderstood.</note>, in honour of the Holy Trinity"<note type="footnote"
                     n="115" resp="#ebrooks">Or. XLV, 2.</note>; though I know that no other <pb
                     n="49"/> undertook the saving passion on our behalf in the flesh except God the
                  Word, who became incarnate for our race. For the whole of the saving Humanization
                  has this effect, that the mystery of the Holy Trinity is revealed to us, although
                  you speak of the birth in flesh, or of the Gross or of the burial, or of the
                  Resurrection from among the dead, dividing the Humanization into many elements.
                  For indeed in each of these we confess that we know the Trinity, in that we
                  indicate upon our faces that the sign of the revered Cross is a dissolver of every
                  evil influence; and, when therefore we sign ourselves, we sign three times, and we
                  show that it is through the Gross that we have obtained knowledge in the Trinity.
                  And this sign is a thing which makes known and completes all things that are done
                  among Christians; and it is everywhere adopted, at the performance of baptism, at
                  the consecration of water, at the celebration of the rational, spiritual
                  sacrifice, and at the symbolic and ineffable ordinations to the priesthood of
                  those who are duly appointed to the sacred ministry, though in all these things we
                  do not call upon one of the hypostases only, that is God the Word who <pb n="50"/>
                  was humanized, but on the three together, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
                  Spirit, indicating that it is by the power of the Cross that we have partaken of
                  all these things and have obtained knowledge in them<note type="footnote" n="116"
                     resp="#ebrooks">A Greek extract from a letter to John the soldier is published
                     in Cramer, Cat. in Act. Apost., p. 136, which from the subject seems to belong
