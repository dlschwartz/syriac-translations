            <p>That a church is a confession of right faith no one who is reckoned among Christians and has
               understanding doubts, since the Lord plainly said in the Gospels to the divine Peter, the first
               of the apostles, when he made the confession, "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God",
               "Thou art Cephas, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of Sheol shall not
               <pb n="169"/> prevail against it"<note type="footnote" n="462" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xvi, 16,
                  18.</note>; and he called the firmness and fixity of such a confession a rock. And, as speech
               knows a right and sound opinion on faith as a church, so it also knows the believers who confess
               it as a church. And David the wonderful among prophets, depicting this church beforehand as a
               queen and a virgin clad in various kinds of flowers and in royal excellencies, and for this
               reason all the more and <note type="footnote" n="463" resp="#ebrooks">This is perh.
                  corrupt.</note> in loving fashion espoused to the king, and gathering many virgin souls, and
               attracting them to her pattern and the example of her chaste life, said, "Virgins shall go to
               the king after her"<note type="footnote" n="464" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. XLIV, 15.</note>. You also
               therefore showed by your writings and acts, after choosing the virgin and angelic life, that is
               free from all material things, that you are walking after the queen and first virgin, the
               church. See therefore that you turn not your looks away, but with all diligence look intently
               and securely and fixedly at her, and cleave to her, in order that, being hard by, you may enter
               the king's temple, which is the expected rest, and the suprasensual bridal-chamber, concerning
               which the same prophet again said, "Holy is thy temple, and wonderful in righteousness"<note
                  type="footnote" n="465" resp="#ebrooks">Id., LXIV, 5, 6.</note>: <pb n="170"/> For it excites
               wonder as something holy and raised above earthly deeds and thoughts, and it cannot be expressed
               and explained in words, but shows by experience to those who are worthy what manner of thing it
               is; and, looking at the bountiful right hand of the Giver, they will say, "Pleasure is in thy
               right hand for ever"<note type="footnote" n="466" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. xv, 11.</note>. These
               things may your chastities find, showing as you do the lamp of asceticism in its brightness,
               through keeping the orthodox faith; for, when this is absent, the lamp inasmuch as it lacks oil
               cannot give light<note type="footnote" n="467" resp="#ebrooks"> Matth., xxv, 1-12. </note>. Be
               not therefore remiss in labours, but sustain yourselves on the hope of the future life, and look
               for a reward to be added to the now existing troubles, and ask the God of all not to allow us to
               be tried beyond what we can bear, but with the trial to give also a way of escape, that we may
               be able to endure<note type="footnote" n="468" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. x, 13.</note>. And these
               things we have written in few words, being as we are at a distance and in varying and unwonted
               places; but every day we are with you in spirit, and speak similar words. </p>
