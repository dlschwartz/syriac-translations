               iniquitous foeman in the water of the deep, and Israel passed through by a road that had not
               been trodden, singing a hymn and saying, "Let us praise the Lord God for he is gloriously
               splendid and glorious"<note type="footnote" n="1195" resp="#ebrooks">Ex. xv, 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>Who is able and sufficient as is meet to praise thy triumphs, O saintly and blessed Severus?
               For they overcome and surpass all intelligence and reason and knowledge. Thee Christ raised up
               as a champion of the orthodox faith, Christ whom also thou didst praise 'for he is gloriously
               splendid and glorious'. </p>
            <pb n="463"/>
            <p>Since thou first receivedst the seal of light, thou didst never consent to defile this by the
               lusts of the world, but straightway betookest thyself to the life of asceticism and didst
               commune with Christ the King, the Saviour of all created things, whom also thou didst praise
               'for he is gloriously splendid and glorious'.</p>
            <div>
               <head>My heart hath been strengthened.</head>
               <p>Thou art the strength and confirmation of them that hope in thee. Lord of all, thou art the
                  light of them that are in darkness and to thee my spirit maketh confession without ceasing.</p>
               <p>Thou art the strength of the truth, thou art the sound prop. Thou art the pillar and the
                  foundation of the churches and we honour the day of thy commemoration.</p>
               <p>Thou didst raise up and confirm the right faith in the churches which were torn by heresies,
                  our father, and we honour the day of thy commemoration.</p>
            </div>

               <head>Lord, I have heard.</head>
               <p>Thou rodest in procession upon horses which are those who please thee, <pb n="464"/> Lord of
                  all, and with strength thou didst hold these reins in thine hands and they became as it were a
                  great salvation in that comeliness becometh (?)<note type="footnote" n="1196" resp="#ebrooks"

                  thy being, Lord of all".</p>
               <p>That wolf once attacked as one that is bold when Justinian overthrew and expelled the party
                  of the orthodox; but Severus opposed him in the mind of the Lord, and by the shafts of his
                  words rescued and saved the flock that was being despoiled.</p>
               <p>Thou didst set up and strengthen the right teachings of the faith without blame, having
                  thrust away alike the cleavage and the confusion of those who foolishly dared io divide or
                  confound, in that thou taughtest us rightly to proclaim the doctrine of one incarnate
                  nature.</p>

            <div>
               <head>In the night my soul.</head>
               <p>Give light to us all, Lord, by thy life-giving commands, and, leading us with thine exalted
                  arm, grant thy peace to our souls, merciful one.</p>
               <p>Supplicate, saintly one, on behalf of the members of the holy church, that <pb n="465"/> they
                  may quickly in mercy be at peace and be united, and through thy prayer be delivered from the
                  assaults of heresies.</p>
               <p>Arise saintly one now also to defend the flock which hath fled to thee for refuge, and
                  restrain by the might of thy prayer the treacherous wolves of all the heresies, who are howling
                  to break it in pieces, and make them cease from it.</p>
               <p>Thou confessedst the incarnate Word to be one hypostasis. and nature only, that was in no
                  wise divided or changed; and therefore the believers zealously honour the day of thy
                  commemoration.</p>

               <p>I pour out my prayer before God, and to him I reveal and declare my distress, because my soul
                  hath been filled with evil things, and my very life hath approached and reached Sheol. Lift me
                  up from destruction, my God, like Jonah from beneath the sea and save me.</p>
               <p>Thou passedst wisely through the grievous storm<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign

                  the orthodox faith, and now in heaven thou dwellest with the saints because thou showedst
