               p. 154, 474. These references make it probable that the letters to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2433">Victor</persName> were written soon after episcopacy. See also below, p. 103, 106.</note>, 
               Because Someone When Reading With the Same <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2433">Victor</persName> in the Book of the Same
               Patriarch Said to Him That It Is Not Proper to Say That the Bread Which Is Consecrated Upon The
               Holy Altars, Which Is the Body of Emmanuel, Is Impassible and Immortal, and Is a Giver Of
               Impassibility and Immortality to Those Who Partake of It, Though Even He Himself Said And
               Confessed That the Bread Which Has Been Transmuted Is the Body, but Not Impassible, Because It
               Is Broken and Divided; In Answer to Which the Holy Man Himself Speaks as Follows. </head>

            <p>For the bread that is consecrated on the holy tables and mystically transmuted is itself truly
               the body, the body of him in whose name it was in <pb n="91"/> fact transmuted, that is of him
               who voluntarily died and rose for our sakes. But, if it is the body of him who rose, it is plain
               that it is impassible and immortal. If we do not look at the bread that is mystically
               transmuted, but at that which comes under the eyes of the senses, and, seeing it broken, do not
               confess it to be indeed immortal, it is time for us to say that neither is it God's body: for
               what is seen is indeed bread. By the faith therefore by which we understand and believe it to be
               the body of God who became incarnate without variation for our sakes, and voluntarily suffered
               and rose, by the same faith we understand and confess that it is also immortal and impassible,
               and bestows impassibility and immortality on us. For he who allowed it to be cut and divided,
               because indeed it was otherwise impossible for us to partake of it, in the same mercifulness
               also allows God's body which has been already transmuted to appear as bread. And for a
               confirmation of the transmutation that is accomplished this has been seen by many even with the
               eyes of their senses themselves, and they have seen bloodstained flesh being broken, not the
               bread that is laid upon the altar.</p>
