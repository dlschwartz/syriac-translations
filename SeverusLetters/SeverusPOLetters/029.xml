            <p>But we hear of the said Mara that he said this also as well, that the holy Virgin did not feel
               the birth, in manifest opposition to the Holy Spirit and to the Scriptures which were spoken by
               him. The loud-voiced among prophets, Isaiah, shows that he came forth from the bond of virginity
               like anything else, and he was ineffably born without rending her from Mary the God-bearer,
               saying thus, "Before she that travailed bare, and before the <pb n="89"/> pain of the travail
               came, she escaped and bare a male child"<note type="footnote" n="214" resp="#ebrooks">Is. LXVI,
                  7.</note>. The fact that she escaped shows that the birth took place with perception on the
               part of her who gave birth, and not in phantasy<note type="footnote" n="215" resp="#ebrooks"
                  ><foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>.</note>. So Gregory the Theologian also in the
               sermon about Easter says of the birth of the babe when it is born: "But she also cried<note
                  type="footnote" n="216" resp="#ebrooks">Greg, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκραγέν</foreign>, from
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκρήγνυμι</foreign>, which the translator has taken for an aor. ind.
                  from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράζω</foreign>.</note> from the compulsion of the virgin and
               maternal bonds, with great power, when a male child was born from the prophetess, as Isaiah
               announces"<note type="footnote" n="217" resp="#ebrooks">Or. xlv, 13.</note>. How could the fact
               that she cried from the compulsion and did not rend the bond of virginity happen without
               perception, and not with such great perception as this oh the part of her who bare? And these
               things took place ineffably and beyond everything. He who wished to come truly in all our
               attributes, and to be made like to us his brethren without sin, was . certainly born in fleshly
               fashion by a manifest and true birth, causing perception in her who bare, free from all pain and
               suffering; for the prophet proclaims that she gave birth before the pain of the travail came.
               For how was she to be subjected to the trial of pains and anguish, who put an end to the bearing
               of children in anguish through the fact that joy was born for the whole race of men? For, "Lo!",
               he says, "I announce unto you great <pb n="90"/> joy, that is to all the people, that there hath
               been born to you to-day a Saviour, who is the Lord Christ"<note type="footnote" n="218"
