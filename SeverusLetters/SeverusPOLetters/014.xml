            <p>We therefore judge that which was desired by those who assembled at Chalcedon against the
               truth, to banish the confession that Christ is to be recognised as from two natures, and to
               introduce instead the confession that he is to be recognised as in two natures, as the company
               of Nestorius desire, to be abominable and also impious, and we will never propound the same
               teaching (?) as those who, in order to open the gates to the doctrines of Nestorius, .....<note type="footnote" n="92" resp="#ebrooks">Some words have fallen
                     out.</note> so we also require the opposite, that the one be openly proclaimed, and the other
               completely suppressed and banished in accordance <pb n="37"/> with the laws of the holy church.
               For let the means of remedy be introduced by the same similar drugs as those by which it was
               desired to produce the sickness; and let us not neglect things that are so manifest, and go
               about and pick out, or search as among reeds, and seek if anywhere in the writings of the holy
               fathers of the orthodox<note type="footnote" n="93" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note> we occasionally find 'difference' or 'in two' or 'from two'
               indiscriminately and incautiously stated. Indeed in the 11th book of the interpretative
               narrative of the Gospel of John the holy Cyril used the expression 'in two' of the separate
               hypostases as follows: "Everywhere and under all circumstances there will follow and coincide
               with the knowledge concerning the offspring the knowledge also concerning him who begot him; as
               indeed the converse also is true. But, if the statement is true and is unhesitatingly received,
               that the Father is understood together with and enters together with the Son, and the Son also
               with the Father, and the knowledge of each of them runs in the two, how can the Son be a
               creature, as. some impious men say?"<note type="footnote" n="94" resp="#ebrooks">In Jo. Ev., ed.
                  Pusey, III, p. 13, 14.</note>; even as no one says that the name and fact of division and union
               are the same, as they themselves indeed suppressed the one and stated the other. <pb n="38"/>
