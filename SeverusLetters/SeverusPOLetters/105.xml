            <p> You should know that the priest who offers represents the great God and our Saviour Jesus
               Christ; for he in fact celebrates the memory of the sacrifice which he himself instituted, and
               of that which he himself began in the mysterious supper.</p>
            <p>The veil therefore which before the priest approaches hides what is set forth and is removed
               after his entry manifestly cries by the mouth of the facts themselves that the mystery, which
               was previously concealed by means of the sacrifices of the law and the shadowy service, and was
               obscurely made known as it were by an indication only, by means of this spiritual and rational
               priestly ministration reveals Christ who is God to those who have believed on him. <pb n="427"/>
            </p>
            <p>To this refer also the words which Paul uses in the epistle to the Corinthians, "The veil
               remaineth upon the readers of the Old Testament, and it is not revealed because<note
                  type="footnote" n="1112" resp="#ebrooks">By misunderstanding <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >ὅτι</foreign> the translator has made nonsense of the sentence.</note> it is done away in
               Christ"<note type="footnote" n="1113" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. III, 14.</note>; since Christ has
               indeed done away or has removed the veil by means of the service and ministration in the Spirit,
               as is further stated by Paul himself, "We all with open face see the glory of the Lord as in a
               mirror"<note type="footnote" n="1114" resp="#ebrooks">Ibid., 19.</note>. For what is done with
               the veil shows according to a simple explanation that things that are hidden from and not [seen]
               by those who initiate, these are manifest and visible to those who believe and are initiated.
               [In] Palestine and in Jerusalem, while the priest makes the said<note type="footnote" n="1115"
                  resp="#ebrooks"> Perh. mentioned in the earlier part of the letter.</note> prayer, the deacons
               frequently and ceaselessly lift [the cover]<note type="footnote" n="1116">This is the sense
                  required.</note> up and let it down again, until the end of the prayer, and so after that the
               priest begins the petition over the offering of the sacrifice. Further what is done in this
               fashion reminds us of that veil or linen sheet which came down from heaven upon Peter, which
               contained all the quadrupeds and reptiles, and birds clean and unclean, and signified to him
               that <pb n="428"/> the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out not only on the people of Israel
               which was clean, because it received God's law, but upon all the nations which were without the
               law and unclean.</p>
            <p>For this reason therefore the cloth that is laid upon what is set forth on the altar shows by
               being lifted and lowered the abundant and perfect gift of the divine Spirit, which was shown to
               Peter by the vision to have included all the nations, which descends from heaven upon [all] that
               is set forth, and consecrates and hallows it<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">.....</supplied></damage><note type="footnote"
