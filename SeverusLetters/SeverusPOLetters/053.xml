            <p>You are acting rightly and as befits women who profess religion in asking everything without
               shame; for there is one thing only that brings shame, if through sin we come in conflict with
               God's laws, and fall under the <pb n="158"/> judgment of divine wrath. I. Know therefore that a
               woman who has the usual flow of blood ought not to communicate in the divine communion till the
               blood ceases to come. II. On the same principle, in the case of one also who has held the chaste
               intercourse of the couch with a lawful husband, after the same intercourse, it is not in
               accordance with religion that she should for the space of a day receive the most mysterious
               food: for these things increase men's awe and clearness of vision as regards the practice of
               religion and the worship of God.</p>
            <p>In the apostolic injunctions something like this is written about a widow who is appointed in
               the churches: "But, after she enters upon her functions, as has been said, let her not be
               concerned with anything, but be alone, for the purpose of undisturbed prayers; for to such a
               widow solitude is a foundation of holiness and of life: for she has had no pleasure in anyone
               else but the God of gods, the Father in heaven. But at stated times let her give praise apart,
               at night and in the morning. If she have a menstruation, let her remain in the church, but not
               approach the altar; not that she is polluted, but because honour is due to the altar"<note
                  type="footnote" n="435" resp="#ebrooks">Test. Dom., i, 42.</note>. For the sake <pb n="159"/>
               of confirmation we have also adduced the answers of the blessed and saintly Timothy, the great
               bishop of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, who was at the time of the synod of the #one hundred and fifty# bishops,
               which in giving instruction on such matters write for us in agreement with the apostles, and on
               the present point enjoin as follows: Question V; if a woman be with her husband at night,
               whether she ought to receive or not; Answer. "They ought not to receive immediately, since the
               apostle cries: 'Deprive not one another, unless it be by consent for a time' (by 'time' he means
               that which is occupied with communion), 'that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and come
               together again, lest Satan tempt you concerning the lust of incontinence'": and again: Question
               VII; if a believing woman see that which is customary among women, whether she ought to approach
               the mysteries on the same day, or not. Answer. "A religious woman therefore who is about to
               receive of the divine communion ought to prepare herself beforehand before that day, and abstain
               from the lawful couch, in honour of the body and blood of God"<note type="footnote" n="436"
