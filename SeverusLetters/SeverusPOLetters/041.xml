               clear that this letter was written before the last 3 of these.</note>, THE BEGINNING OF WHICH
               is, "When I came to the high-priestly throne<note type="footnote" n="365" resp="#ebrooks"

            <p>And know this, that, where general unions were concerned, the fathers did not wish to inquire
               into the observance of the strict rule with regard to names. Many of the #three hundred and
               eighteen# who assembled at Nicaea, as ecclesiastical histories relate, were present at the synod
               at Ariminus [sic] and at Sardica<note type="footnote" n="366" resp="#ebrooks">The synod of
                  Philippopolis is meant.</note>; and still, though the doctrines there laid down<note
                     type="footnote" n="367" resp="#ebrooks">The word <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                        >δογματισθῆναι</foreign> is here preserved.</note> were not approved, no one contended about
               names. And in the same way at Nicaea<note type="footnote" n="368" resp="#ebrooks">Nice is meant,
                  and Severus intends to say that the synod of Nice was rejected.</note> in Thrace also the synod of
               bishops which pronounced that the Father is like the Son, not co-essential, was rightly
               rejected; and yet there was no question about names at that time. It is a long matter to recount
               the other rejected synods, that at Sirmium, that at Lampsacus, that at Rome, that at Zelo<note
                  type="footnote" n="369" resp="#ebrooks">Zela is meant.</note>, that at your Seleucia, all of
               which the synod of the 150 caused to be passed over in silence as if it had <pb n="135"/>
               forgotten them, not introducing among us any vain talk or superfluous inquiry about names, but
               only asserting the divinity<note type="footnote" n="370" resp="#ebrooks">The word <foreign
                  xml:lang="grc">θεολογῆσαι</foreign> is here preserved.</note> of the Holy Spirit together with
               the Father and the Son, and explaining the intention of the #three hundred and eighteen#. And,
               when the holy Cyril with the holy synod at Ephesus accomplished the deprivation<note
                  type="footnote" n="371" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαίρεσις</foreign>.</note> of
               the evil Nestorius, the bishops of the East, though they contended for his rejected tenets<note
                  type="footnote" n="3" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note>,
               afterwards agreed to the deprivation<note type="footnote" n="371" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
                  xml:lang="grc">καθαίρεσις</foreign>.</note> of that wolf and the rejections of the hateful
               tenets<note type="footnote" n="372" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >δόγματα</foreign>.</note>; and there was never any discussion about names, although how many
               do you think had died in the meanwhile, who contended for the wickedness of Nestorius? For these
               things, as I have said, general unions have no room; but they remained without examination;
               since many are in fact passed over at councils, although they have often been involved in
               impious opinions. Since then at the present time some common agreement among the churches is
               hoped for, do not lower your mind to untimely hair-splitting. As there is a time to speak and a
               time to be silent<note type="footnote" n="373" resp="#ebrooks">Ecclesiastes iii, 7.</note>, so there
               is a time both to inquire into a matter of this kind and not to inquire. Bear these things in
               mind and be rightly disposed, <pb n="136"/> and have no regard to men who cleave to division,
               and find fault with everything in the same way, whom the sacred Scripture calls backbiters and
               enemies of the common peace, and Christ the God of peace<note type="footnote" n="374"
                  resp="#ebrooks">Romans I, 30.</note>.</p>
