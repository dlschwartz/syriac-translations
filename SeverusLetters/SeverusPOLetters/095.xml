            <p> But perhaps someone will say in question, "How are we to understand that the words which God
               spoke were uttered?" (meaning words such as those that were addressed to Adam, "Where art thou,
               Adam?"<note type="footnote" n="934" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. iii, 9.</note>, and those to Moses on
               the mountain at the giving of the law, and on the banks of Jordan, when Christ was baptized with
               the dispensatory baptism which saves us, and again when his appearance was changed on the
               mountain, when Peter and James and John were with him); for lo! we see that they are words of a
               saying that was uttered through the articulation, and it is written that they were heard by
               human ears, and it plainly cried by the Jordan and on the mountain, "This is my beloved Son in
               whom I am well pleased"<note type="footnote" n="935" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. iii, 7; xvii,
                  5.</note>. We should therefore know, both in these cases and in all similar ones, that we ought
               not to fall from the supposition that befits God, and say that God emits <pb n="350"/> the sound
               of the composition of words made through the lips and with the tongue, but be assured, and that
               very wisely and confidently, that, by the divine operation and by the power that makes all
               things that exist, the filling word was brought into being. This the holy Cyril teaches and
               confirms in the work which he addressed to Theodosius: "For the Jews said that they knew that
               God spoke with Moses<note type="footnote" n="936" resp="#ebrooks">John ix, 29.</note>. For
               perhaps they did not know by reason of great stupidity that no one has ever heard the nature
               that is above all things speaking in a manner befitting men, but the words that are addressed to
               men are brought into being in a manner which he knows, for it is not possible for us to say. For
               what work will God fail from weakness to perform? For what will he not bring to pass if he
               wishes, and that very easily?"<note type="footnote" n="937" resp="#ebrooks">Not in either of the
                  extant works addressed to Theodosius. </note></p>
            <p>When also it is written that the words of God were brought to one of the saints through a
               mediating angel, according to the same reverent principle let us say that the words that were
               emitted by the mediation of an angel were brought into being through divine inspiration and so
               to speak by operation. And this Athanasius teaches in the 3rd treatise on the Trinity<note
                  type="footnote" n="938" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XXVIII. 1201 ff. (spurious). No special passage
                  seems to be intended.</note>. </p>
