            <p> But, since your saintliness asked with regard to Enoch and Elijah, of whom one was translated
               that he should not see death, as the apostle said<note type="footnote" n="872" resp="#ebrooks"
                  >Heb. XI, 5.</note>, <pb n="321"/> while the other was caught up towards heaven, if they will
               undergo the common death, it is incumbent upon us to state, in proportion to the small capacity
               which we possess, the things that have reached our comprehension from the teaching of the
               fathers. It is believed therefore according to the testimonies of the divine words that Enoch
               was translated, and Elijah was caught up towards heaven, and was carried by the air<note
                  type="footnote" n="873" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>, and that
               they are alive, and that they are in such places as God knows, and that he<note type="footnote"
                  n="874" resp="#ebrooks">A. v. (M) 'Who'.</note> bestowed upon them such a marvellous
               translation hence, and that they are in a mortal body, having not yet received the blessing of
               immortality. For let us agree with Paul who says generally of all the holy men who pleased God,
               "And all these to whom testimony was borne through faith received not the promises, God having
               foreseen , some better thing for our sakes. that they might not be perfected without us"<note
                  type="footnote" n="875" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. XI, 39, 40.</note>. And it is manifest that
               perfection <pb n="322"/> is nothing else except a state of immortality and glory, and
               impassibility, that does not grow old, in the kingdom of heaven. That this is so is confirmed by
               John also the wise in the Spirit, who became bishop of Constantinople, in the 22nd homily of the
               commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he gives the following teaching: "But many
               inquire whither Enoch was translated, and why he was translated, and why he did not die, neither
               he nor. Elijah, and, if they are still living, how they are living, and in what form. But it is
               superfluous for us to inquire into these things. For that the one was translated and the other
               was taken up the Scriptures stated; but where they exist or how they exist they did not go on to
               say; for they do not say anything beyond what is necessary"<note type="footnote" n="876"
                  resp="#ebrooks">In Ep. ad Heb. Hom, xxii, 8 (ed. Field).</note>. And the same doctor delivered
               an expository discourse in Constantinople in the church of Marth Anastasia<note type="footnote"
                  n="877" resp="#ebrooks"> In the Greek title it is called the church of S. Thomas, and the
                  biblical citation and the mention of the martyrs are absent.</note> about the saying of the
               apostle who says, "Henceforth, my brethren, be strong in our Lord and in the power of his
               might"<note type="footnote" n="878" resp="#ebrooks">Eph. vi, 10.</note>, and, it being the day
               of the actual commemoration of the martyrs, and the king <pb n="323"/> having come to the
               martyrs' chapel and withdrawn before the sermon, he delivered a discourse after the king's
               departure, of which the beginning is: "Blessed is God for the greatness of the power of the
               martyrs, for yesterday they drew the whole city with the queen, and to-day the king with his
               soldiers, with great reverence". And, when in this discourse he was explaining about death and
               the resurrection, he gave this teaching: "Since therefore the fear had increased and had shaken
               the mind, see how thereafter he introduces also the hope concerning the resurrection, a dark
               hope indeed and not clear, but still he introduces it. For Enoch, who came into being after
               these things, he did not allow to die; and Paul says that 'by faith Enoch was translated that he
               might not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him'. For he translated him
               and did not allow him to die. He did not yet make him immortal, in order that he might not do
               away the fear, but he remains without dying. And he is not immortal; but he gave continuance of
               life in the mortal body, opening up, as I said, obscurely the hope of the resurrection"<note
