               <p>Being pricked by these words and divine laws as by goads, and fearing and trembling, I
                  mentioned the matter of those from Cappadocia who wish to be united to us to the saintly
                  Dioscorus bishop of Alexandria and our fellow-minister, and<note type="footnote" n="1"
                     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> consulted with your learning
                  also, revealing to you all my affairs from the beginning, and hiding nothing whatever; and I do
                  not know how it is that you have thrown over the letters and consultations that have passed
                  since that time, and tell us to take no account of those from Cappadocia the waste country, but
                  to treat the divine laws that I have just mentioned with contempt. In the first place the same
                  account is due to one soul <pb n="146"/> and to many; and next how can we call the two
                  Cappadocias and Armenia waste places? But in this you thought or spoke rather<note
                     type="footnote" n="404" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> like
                  the natives of the country (allow me with your pardon to say), and not truly. For it is the
                  habit of the Alexandrines to think that the sun rises for them only, and towards them only the
                  lamp burns, so that they even jestingly term outside cities 'lampless'. If for the purpose of
                  right judgments it is possible to weigh the numbers of a people, like weights that are
                  distinguished by the inclinations of the scale of a balance, the inhabitants of all these
                  countries will produce no less than the whole city of the Alexandrines. But you say that in the
                  case of men who make right requests we should have regard to our understanding. But in this
                  also we have a better principle, as we showed in what we said a little before, having countless
                  other texts of the God-inspired Scriptures also which command us, that those that are strong
                  should bear the infirmities of those that are weak<note type="footnote" n="405" resp="#ebrooks"
                     >Rom. XV, 1.</note>, and that we should not have regard to our own affairs but to the interest
                  of others<note type="footnote" n="406" resp="#ebrooks">Philipp. II, 4.</note>, and texts that
                  agree with those. And, while was writing and speaking <pb n="147"/> these things, I showed
                  caution in every point, and did not trust to myself in everything, but awaited the assent of
                  the saintly Dioscorus my fellow-minister who shares my opinions, and Eleusinius<note

                  fellow-communicants and now hold them as such, since they have anathematized the synod of
                  Chalcedon by many signatures in no small number of tomes: but Soteric<note type="footnote"
                     n="409" resp="#ebrooks">Bp. of Caesarea; see ep. 45.</note> who offered us a covenant of union
                  and conjunction I passed over, for I did not wish to term him our fellow-communicant by letter
                  (how could I so term one who is not bound in communion?) Wherefore also Asterius, his
                  God-loving brother, and bishop of Nyssa, is ready to leave the see. So for our part we held to
                  our own principles and did not give any man, to speak in the words of Scripture, cause of
                  offence<note type="footnote" n="410">I Cor. X, 32 (?).</note>. For we know positively and we
                  say openly<note type="footnote" n="411" resp="#ebrooks">With <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >παρρησία</foreign>.</note> that you have formed an execrable purpose that is not pleasing to
                  God. And I beg your learning not to bestow this foolish favour on me at all, and hide what was
                  written by me, but make it known, if possible, to everyone. What sense is there in <pb n="148"

                  who call our one Lord and God Jesus Christ two natures after the incomprehensible union. And

                  frightened, nor did I fear, nor yield to the time, though he said, "The kingdom of the Romans

                  addressed to Timothy": and this I did not say without writing it down, but I expressed myself
