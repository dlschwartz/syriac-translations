            <p>But with regard to the reception of Eutyches that it was done in a canonical way, and that it
               casts no slur on the holy. Dioscorus, and on the synod which assembled with him at Ephesus, I
               addressed the arguments on this head to certain persons some time ago, and I also dealt
               completely with it as the truth demands; and I have thought it good and urgent to send a copy of
               these things to your learning. Not only the wretched man from Scythopolis<note type="footnote"
                  n="220">John the scholastic: see Loofs, Leontius v. Byzanz, p. 269 (Texte u. Untersuchungen,
                  Bd. III); Lebon, Le Monophysisme Severien, p. 149, 153, 162.</note>, but many others besides
               before him and after him, employed the same blasphemous absurdities, not knowing what they are
               saying<note type="footnote" n="221" resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim. i, 7. </note>, but made
               empty-mindedness fulness of blasphemy against God. The holy synod which assembled at Ephesus
               with the saintly witness of the truth Dioscorus taught nothing new whatever with regard to the
               faith, but only effected the deprivation<note type="footnote" n="222" resp="#ebrooks">
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαίρεσις</foreign>.</note> of those who were infected with the Jewish
               poison of <pb n="93"/> Nestorius and cast them off: but Eutyches, who presented a petition and
               anathematized his heresy, on account of which he was accused, it accepted on the ground of the
               actual petition itself and on the ground of the minutes<note type="footnote" n="223"
                  resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπομνήματα</foreign>.</note> that were written at
               Constantinople before Flavian, since it did not recognise the poison that was in his heart, and
               the disease hard to be discovered was in accordance with the human standard properly hidden from
               it; for the divine Scripture plainly teaches that 'man looks on the face, but God looks on the
               heart'<note type="footnote" n="224" resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam. XVI, 7.</note>. But what will anyone
               say about those who assembled at Chalcedon, who received Theodoret and Hiba, who not merely hid
               the foul heresy of Nestorius in the heart, but actually displayed it with open face. When the
               contents of the minutes' on account of which Hiba's deprivation<note type="footnote" n="225"
                  resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαίρεσις</foreign>.</note> took place had been read,
               and his letter to Mari the Persian, which was full of many blasphemies (a copy of which I have
               also sent to you), the representatives of Leo, who had become prelate of the church of the
               Romans, pronounced him blameless, making the following declaration<note type="footnote" n="226"
                  resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαλαλία</foreign>.</note>: "Pascasinus and Lucentius
               the reverend bishops and Boniface the presbyter representing <pb n="94"/> the apostolic
               throne<note type="footnote" n="227" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >θρόνος</foreign>.</note> said by the mouth of Pascasinus, 'From the reading of the
               documents<note type="footnote" n="228" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >χάρτης</foreign>.</note>, and from the statement<note type="footnote" n="229" resp="#ebrooks"
                     ><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόφασις</foreign>.</note> of the reverend bishops we know that the
               reverend Hiba has been shown to be innocent. For, when his letter was read, we recognised that
               it is orthodox<note type="footnote" n="230" resp="#ebrooks">
                  <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθόδοξος</foreign>.</note>; and therefore our decision is that the
               episcopal rank also and the church from which he was wrongfully ejected in his absence be
               restored'"<note type="footnote" n="231" resp="#ebrooks">Mansi, VII, 261.</note>. And to these
               things the whole synod assented; and they promulgated the same decision. How then can those who
               defend those men dare to make the reception of Eutyches, which took place according to the
               canons, a charge against the holy Dioscorus and the synod which assembled with him?</p>
