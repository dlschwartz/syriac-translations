                  xxvii, 52. 5. Ibid, 53. </note>: "For, if 'many', it is plain that all did not; and, if

               For this also is the reason for which he said that they 'appeared to many'<note type="footnote"

               that is manifest to make known something that is not manifest, whom Christ's descent into Sheol
               benefited, viz. the saints who had already purified their soul. For, when he went thither, he
               made proclamation to the spirits in prison also who had aforetime been disobedient according to
               the statement of the apostle Peter<note type="footnote" n="1168" resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. iii, 19,
                  20. </note>. And to all alike he appeared, having broken gates of bronze and shattered
               bars<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μοχλοί</foreign>.</note> of
               iron as it is written<note type="footnote" n="1169" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. cvi, 16.</note>. But all
               did not know him, nor benefit by his appearance, but those <pb n="452"/> only who lived
               uprightly, who also, if he had appeared to them while they were still living the life in the
               flesh would certainly<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

               all did not rise at that time with Christ, nor all who had died benefit by his descent into
               Sheol, although he himself appeared and made proclamation to all alike, but those who had
               already purified their soul as we have said, and therefore knew him and believed, Gregory the
               Theologian in the sermon on the Passover handed down, after expanding the question as is proper
               in what he added, writing thus<note type="footnote" n="1170" resp="#ebrooks">This extract and
                  the 2nd from Ignatius are edited in Gr. with heading <foreign xml:lang="grc">Σευήρου</foreign>
                  in Cramer, Cat. in, Epp. Cath., p. 67 (Lightfoot Apost. Fathers, II, i, 178); but what precedes
                  and follows, though similar to our text, differs widely from it.</note>: "If he go down to

                     type="footnote" n="1173" resp="#ebrooks">I cannot render this otherwise (see Lightfoot, p.
                     192).</note>, saw ineffable mysteries, so that he was even careful to say of himself, and this
               with humble mind, "For I also in that I am hound and am able to understand <pb n="453"/> the
               heavenly things and the angelic locations, and the princely companies, visible and again
               invisible, am not thereby a disciple"<note type="footnote" n="1174" resp="#ebrooks">Ad Trall.,
                  v.</note>, in writing to those at Magnesia said thus: "For the divine prophets lived in Jesus
               Christ; therefore also they were persecuted, being inspired by his grace in order that the
               incredulous might be persuaded that there is one God who revealed himself through Jesus Christ
               his Son"; and a little further on: "How shall we able to live without him? whom the prophets
               also, being his disciples in the spirit, expected as a teacher, and therefore he whom they
               rightly awaited, when he came, raised them from the place of the dead"<note type="footnote"
                  n="1175">Ad Magn., viii, ix.</note>. You see that those who like the prophets lived in Jesus
               Christ, that is in justice and saintly deeds, benefited by our Saviour's descent into Sheol;
               many of whose bodies arose, and appeared for the confirmation only of the power of him who went
               down into the lower parts of the earth as I said, not to give the recompense of the resurrection
               that is promised to all together, on the day of the righteous recompensing.</p>
            <p><supplied reason="ellipsis" resp="#compiler">(<emph rend="ital">And lower down.</emph>)</supplied> "For to
               this end it was preached to the dead also, that <pb n="454"/> they may be judged in the flesh as
               men, but live in God in the spirit"<note type="footnote" n="1176" resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. IV,
                  6.</note>. For it was not to the just, but chiefly to sinners and those sunk in transgression
               that the gospel was proclaimed, that they might judge themselves, humanly publishing a sentence
               against themselves and judging the flesh, and bringing their soul into subjection by works of
               repentance and urging it to escape from the divine judgment, since there is also fear of falling
               into the hands of the living God<note type="footnote" n="1177" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. x,
                  31.</note>, in order that they might be judged in the flesh as men (that is, that a man in
               mercy on his soul might judge himself), but live in God in the spirit.</p>
