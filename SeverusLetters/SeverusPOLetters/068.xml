               Written Before Episcopacy, Which Was Addressed to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2737">Phocas</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2647">Eupraxius</persName> the Chamberlains. </head>

            <p> For, after the fishermen had proclaimed the gospel and caught all the world, the word of
               truth took teachers of the church from profane wisdom, and seized them like vessels of
               sanctification (?)<note type="footnote" n="647" resp="#ebrooks">There is no authority for this
                  meaning of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܣܝܢܐ</foreign>, which is perh. corrupt.</note>, and,
               having given them to taste of the bowl of true wisdom, and satisfied them with the
               unintoxicating drinks of the Holy Spirit, it sent them out like fishermen and they caught those
               who were puffed up with the wisdom of the rulers of this world on all mountains, that is by
               means of the very thoughts of false <pb n="242"/> knowledge which are supposed to be high and
               elevated. This was proclaimed beforehand by <persName>Jeremiah</persName> the prophet when he said thus: "'Lo! I send
               out the many fishermen', saith the Lord, 'and they shall catch them; and after these things I
               will send out the many hunters, and they shall catch them on all mountains, and on all high
               places'"<note type="footnote" n="648" resp="#ebrooks">Jeremiah 16:16.</note>; though indeed,
               when a goodly spoil has been caught by the doctrines of divine wisdom, they reveal and expose
               their own defeat by means of another prophecy, crying to God their Saviour, "Behold us. We will
               be bondmen to thee, because tho.u art the Lord our God, and truly the high places and the power
               of the mountains were reduced to falsehood"<note type="footnote" n="649">Jeremiah 16:22, 23.</note>. 
               But, if the thoughts of profane wisdom are understood to be the low mountains, we
               shall consequently understand that the gates of bronze which are shattered and the bars<note
                  type="footnote" n="650" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μοχλός</foreign>.</note> of
               iron that are broken<note type="footnote" n="651" resp="#ebrooks">Isaiah XLV, 2.</note> are the
               snares of argument and the precise questions stated in words from which there is no escape,
               which have many windings; questions which the truth has refuted and dissolved, being, stronger
               than everything, which heaven also blesses, as <persName>Ezra</persName> said<note type="footnote" n="652">1 (3)
                  Esdras 4:35, 36.</note>; questions which <persName>Jeremiah</persName> calls 'holes of the rocks', on account of
               the secrecy and obscurity and the <pb n="243"/> ambushes hard to see which the same objections
               contain; for "they shall catch them", he says, "on all mountains, and on all high places and
               from the holes of the rocks". For the low mountains may be understood in another way also as
               those who are proud and arrogant in character, but are taught the gospel and made lowly, and are
               changed so that they cast themselves on their faces on the earth and converted to a humble
               demeanour by hearing the Teacher say, "Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
               shall find rest for your souls"<note type="footnote" n="653" resp="#ebrooks">Matthew 11:29.</note>, 
               and thereby another prophecy of <persName>Isaiah</persName> also is fulfilled in addition which says,
               "All mountains and all high places shall be brought low, and the crooked places shall be made
               straight, and those that have rough paths smooth, and all flesh shall see God's salvation"<note
                  type="footnote" n="654" resp="#ebrooks">Isaiah 40:4, 5.</note>. But, if we call the change of the
               souls of the haughty to a lowly demeanour the low mountains, we shall not receive it as
               unfitting that the gates of bronze and the bars<note type="footnote" n="655"><foreign
                  xml:lang="grc">μοχλός</foreign>.</note> of iron are the character of wickedness that is very
               wicked, that has not only set men under the compulsion<note type="footnote" n="656"
                  resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάγκη</foreign>.</note> of nature, but also<note
                     type="footnote" n="657" resp="#ebrooks">Mss. om.</note> brought them to such a state that they
               cannot be reformed, since 'they have been constrained in their will', as <persName>Jeremiah</persName> says, 'and <pb
                  n="244"/> become pieces of flesh'<note type="footnote" n="658" resp="#ebrooks">I cannot trace
                     this quotation. All this part of the letter is corrupt in the mss., and it is only by free
                     emendation that I can produce any sense.</note>, so that they are not able to have God's
               spirit dwelling in them. That character so to speak of gates of bronze and bars<note
                  type="footnote" n="659" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μοχλός</foreign>.</note> of
               iron was shattered and crushed by the power of the divine Incarnation by him who said, "The
               kingdom of heaven belongs to violent men, and violent men seize it"<note type="footnote" n="660"
                  resp="#ebrooks">Matthew xi, 12.</note>, and, "I will give thee hidden and secret treasures, and
               invisible ones will I open to thee that thou mayst know that I am the Lord God who calleth thy
               name, the God of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, because of <persName>Jacob</persName> my bondman and <placeName>Israel</placeName> my chosen"<note type="footnote"
                  n="661" resp="#ebrooks">Isaiah 45:3, 4.</note>. And we said before at the beginning of the
               composition that <persName>Cyrus</persName> searched the very depths of the earth themselves in Babylon, and carried
               all the riches of the <persName>Babylonians</persName> into captivity. This therefore God himself promises to <persName>Cyrus</persName>
               by word of mouth, saying, "I will give thee hidden and secret treasures, and invisible ones will
               I open to thee, that thou mayst know that I am the Lord thy God, who called thy name, the God of
               <placeName>Israel</placeName>". But he uses the name 'kingdom', on account of which he also termed him 'anointed'<note
                  type="footnote" n="662">Isaiah 45:1. There is no mention of the name 'kingdom' in our texts, but
                  only <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσχὺν βασιλέων</foreign>.</note>. "These", he says, "you shall
               find, because of <persName>Jacob</persName> my bondman and <placeName>Israel</placeName> my chosen", <pb n="245"/> whom also <persName>Cyrus</persName> brought
               up from captivity: therefore he merited also the aforesaid rewards. It was because of <persName>Cyrus</persName>
               therefore that the announcement was put together in this way: but the aforestated words fit
               <persName>Christ</persName> the Saviour of us all also; for, if he divested himself and became poor for our; sake
               while he is rich<note type="footnote" n="663" resp="#ebrooks">2 Corinthians 8:9.</note>, he does
               not refuse to have words used of him which befit his exinanition.</p>
