            <p>For he said, "Go make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
               the Son, and the Holy Spirit"<note type="footnote" n="108" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxviii,
                  19.</note>; so that there is aHoly Trinity, divided and distinct in hypostases, but not divided
               in one essence<note type="footnote" n="109" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and Godhead, and kingship and glory and eternity and the other
               attributes which God has by nature. For the Father has one thing hypostatically, fatherhood, and
               the fact that he is unbegotten; and the Son again has one thing hypostatically, sonship, and the
               fact that he was begotten by the Father; and the Holy Spirit again has one thing, the fact that
               he was not begotten, but proceeds eternally without beginning from the Father: for in virtue of
               these things distinctness of person belongs to each one of them, that is, is marked out and
               defined for the hypostases, but all the other attributes are, as I have said, common, equal in
               honour and undivided, and such as show that we for our part have believed in one God, and in one
               <pb n="46"/> essence<note type="footnote" n="109" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, and he exists and is made known in three hypostases. For the Son was
               begotten by the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father, although eternally and without
               time, and their ascent is to him, as to a root and source, and from him they are, though they
               are not after him. And for this reason, while we confess three hypostases, we do not believe in
               three first causes, but one first cause, and one kingship. After pursuing the matter so far we
               praise only and do not investigate what the unbegottenness of the Father is, or what the
               generation of the Son is, or what the procession of the Holy Spirit is; for these things are
               known only by the Father who begot and the Son who was begotten, and the Holy Spirit who
               proceeds from the Father: but he requires us to know 'through these things that we are to
               confess one essence<note type="footnote" n="110" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and Godhead, made known in three distinct hypostases.</p>
