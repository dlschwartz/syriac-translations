               resp="#ebrooks">Select Letters of Severus, viii, 4.</note>, EXPLAINING WHY, WHEN THE GOSPELS
               AND THE OTHER DIVINE SCRIPTURES SAY THAT CHRIST DAWNED UPON US IN THE LAST DAY, WE SEE THAT MANY
               REVOLUTIONS OF YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT TIME. </head>

            <p>If Jews and heathens accepted the words of the apostles, we should have said what Peter says
               in the second epistle: "One day with the Lord is as a <pb n="299"/> thousand years, and a
               thousand years as one day. The Lord delayeth not from his promise, as some reckon delay; but he
               is long-suffering toward us not wishing that any should perish, but that all men should come to
               repentance, but the day of the Lord will come as a thief, wherein the heavens shall pass away
               with a cry, the elements shall be burnt and dissolved"<note type="footnote" n="796"
                  resp="#ebrooks">2 Pet. iii, 8-10.</note>. But, since those men are under no obligation<note
                     type="footnote" n="797" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάγκη</foreign></note> to bow
               to the writings of the New Testament<note type="footnote" n="798" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
                  xml:lang="grc">διαθήκη</foreign></note>, but from this source yet more increase their
               unbelief, we will produce a demonstration for them from the prophetic words. Daniel the seer of
               those divine visions hard of interpretation, when he was explaining Nebuchadnezzar's dream, and
               was revealing the heterogeneousness of the image that appeared to him in the dream, which was
               composed of gold and silver and bronze and iron and earthenware, and by the diversity of the
               materials<note type="footnote" n="799" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >ὕλας</foreign></note> signified the various kingdoms, said of Christ's kingdom as follows:
               "And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall not be
               destroyed for ever; and his kingdom shall not pass to another people. It shall break in pieces
               and scatter all the kingdoms and itself shall stand for ever"<note type="footnote" n="800"
                  resp="#ebrooks">Dan. ii, 44.</note>. Those therefore who proclaimed <pb n="300"/> the gospel
               applied the term 'last days' to the days of Christ's kingdom and the evangelic life.</p>
            <p>John the Evangelist also when he said in his epistle, "Children, it is the last season"<note
               type="footnote" n="801" resp="#ebrooks">1 John ii, 18.</note>, did not speak falsely. For it is
               in fact the custom to apply the term 'seasons'<note type="footnote" n="802" resp="#ebrooks">Or
                  'hours'. The double meaning cannot be preserved.</note> not only to those of the days, but also
               to those of the whole year: for the whole course of the year is divided into the spring season,
               the summer season, the autumn season, and the winter season; and the winter was in truth that of
               godlessness, which covered the whole world, in which there was all spiritual barrenness, and
               coldness as regards the fervour of the divine Spirit, and the whole earth was completely devoid
               of the gifts from heaven, when Christ 'the Sun of righteousness'<note type="footnote" n="803"
                  resp="#ebrooks">Mai., iv, 2. 4. Cf. ep. 79.</note> by his coming in the flesh dawned upon
               us.</p>
            <p>And, to put it in another way, since 5000 years and more had passed since the world came into
               being, as the writings of Moses have handed down to us, and from Christ's coming there has not
               yet been completed as much as 600 or 700 or 1000 years<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"> Cf.
                  ep. 79.</note> (let us concede this), how can it appear unreasonable to apply the term ' last'
               to the days of the 600 years or may be 1000, <pb n="301"/> 'when compared with those of the
               5000? Johannes also in the 34th homily of the Commentary on the Gospel of John uses these words,
               which agree with the above sentiments: "For whence do you know, O man, that the end is not near
               and that the things mentioned will occur after a short time<note type="footnote" n="804">The
                  translator has misunderstood the Greek, where <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐ</foreign> covers both
                  clauses.</note>? For, as we do not say that the last day is the end of the year, but also the
               last month, although it contains 30 days, so also, even if I call 400 years the end of so large
               a number of years, I shall not be wrong"<note type="footnote" n="805" resp="#ebrooks">In Joh.
                  Hom.XXXIV, 3 (ed. Par. 2a, VIII, 230).</note>.</p>
