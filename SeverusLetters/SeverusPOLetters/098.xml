            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">OF MAR SEVERUS FROM THE 5th LETTER OF THE 4th BOOK OF THOSE
               AFTER EXILE, WHICH WAS ADDRESSED TO CAESARIA THE HYPATISSA, WHICH BEGINS, "When I read the
               letter of your magnificence's love of God, not once nor twice". </head>
            <dateline resp="#ebrooks">

            <p> But to the question which your excellency's magnificence has asked me by letter I return an
               easy answer, that for my part I have never accepted or expressed agreement with those who speak
               of an apokatastasis, and an end to the judgment involved in the torments that are threatened us
               in the future world, and the man who says that he has a letter of mine which proclaims this
               opinion manifestly lies. Therefore I praised your God-loving magnificence for asking for such a
               letter to be shown to you; a letter which the man who concocted it necessarily set himself
               falsely to show to be my composition. Those who hold such an opinion, wishing to accomplish
               their desires, as if forsooth on the basis of plausible suppositions, make use of arguments that
               are gratifying to the hearers, saying that it is unbecomingto or unworthy <pb n="371"/> of God,
               and far removed from his mercifulness, that the man who has sinned for 50 or 100 years in this
               world should endure torments for unending ages, forgetting this, that God's laws and those
               which, prevail among men think fit to requite sins according to the intention of the sinner, and
               one may hear even wise men outside saying of certain persons who have done foul deeds and acts
               that are not permitted, "This man deserves to die not once but many times"<note type="footnote"

               when a man hears as we do that God who became incarnate and was humanized without variation for

               the latter, he spoke in exactly the same fashion of an equality without distinction, applying
               the word ' eternal' to both without distinction. Basil the great among teachers of the truth
               shows this clearly in the teaching composed by him in the form of question and answer addressed
               to the brethren of the convents; and it is the 219th question, which is expressed as follows:
               "The brethren say<note type="footnote" n="996" resp="#ebrooks"> (F) 'when be was asked by the
                  brethren'</note>. 'If<note type="footnote" n="997" resp="#ebrooks">In another version (EKL)

               beaten with many stripes and another with few, how <pb n="375"/> say some that there is no end
               to the sentence of those who are tormented?'</p>
            <p>Basil<note type="footnote" n="998" resp="#ebrooks"> (F) 'the great among doctors'.</note>
               says.</p>
            <p>Points which are matters of dispute and seen to be obscurely expressed m various places of the
               Holy Scriptures are elucidated by clear statements in other places. Since therefore our Lord
               says at one time, 'These shall go into eternal torment<note type="footnote" n="999"
                  resp="#ebrooks"> (F) and EL ins. 'and the righteous into eternal life; Bas. om.</note>', and at
               another dismisses some to 'the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels', and at
               another mentions 'the gehenna of fire', uttering further the words,<note type="footnote"
                  n="1000">A.v.(EKL) om.</note> 'Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched', and
               again said before through the prophet about certain <pb n="376"/> men,<note type="footnote"
                  n="1001" resp="#ebrooks"> (EKL); "Ye shall go out and see the corpses of them who have

               used in the divine Scriptures, this also was brought about by the machination of the devil, in
               order that men, forgetting these and similar decrees of our Lord, might presume to sin without
               restraint, persuading themselves that there is an end to judgment. For, if it is possible for

               judgment, there will assuredly also be an end to eternal life. But, if we do not consent to
               think this with regard to<note type="footnote" n="1004" resp="#ebrooks"> (EKL) 'that there is an
                  end to eternal'.</note> life, what plausibility is there in our assigning<note type="footnote"
                     n="1005" resp="#ebrooks"> (EKL) 'room is there for the theory that there is'.</note> an end to
               eternal judgment? For the addition of the word 'eternal' is made equally in both cases. 'These
               shall go into eternal <pb n="377"/> judgment, and the righteous into eternal life'. These things
               therefore being thus admitted, we must know that the words 'He shall be beaten with many
               stripes' and 'shall be beaten with few' are not an end, but signify a difference of torment.
               For, if God is an upright judge, not only to the good but also to the evil<note type="footnote"
                  n="1006" resp="#ebrooks">A.v. (EK) om.</note>, and requites each according to his deeds, it is
               possible for one to be in the fire that is not quenched<note type="footnote" n="1007">A.V. (EK)
                  ins. 'and another to be in fire'.</note>, burning either less or more than the other, and
               another in the worm that dies not, both one that hurts little and one that hurts much<note

               each as he deserves, and another in gehenna that has a variety of torments, and another in outer
               darkness, and that there <pb n="378"/> is a place where a man is found amidst weeping only, and
               there is a place where he is amidst gnashing of teeth also from the severity of the pains<note

                  gehenna a variety of torments of those who are being requited'.</note>. But the outer darkness
               signifies that there is in truth an inner darkness also.<note type="footnote" n="1010"

               our Lord in accordance with customary usage, as are also many other similar phrases. For we know
               that this form of speech is frequently adopted even with regard to those who are suffering from
