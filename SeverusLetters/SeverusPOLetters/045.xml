            <p>They are not acting rightly who think that our oblation is not pure on account of the names of
               those who have already died, and who have fallen into heretical tenets<note type="footnote"
                  n="388"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note>, and have not been removed from the
               sacred tablets; because in fact such matters did not affect the oblation of orthodoxy<note
                  type="footnote" n="389" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθοδοξία</foreign>.</note> of
               the holy fathers also. Though Eusebius Pamphili contended for the disease of Arius, both in
               speech and in act, the members of the church of Caesarea mentioned his name, until the holy
               Cyril passed by, when he was hastening to the city of the Ephesians, and had this name removed.
               What shall we then say? That throughout the time during which the name of Eusebius stood in the
               sacred tablets it perturbed the oblation of men who held right opinions<note type="footnote"
                  n="388"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note>? What? When again the same holy Cyril
               of saintly memory wrote to the holy <pb n="142"/> Proclus bishop of Constantinople at that time
               to spare the name of Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was the putrid source of the hateful and putrid
               tenets<note type="footnote" n="390"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note> of
               Nestorius, in order not to give an opportunity to those who wished to disturb the church<note
                  type="footnote" n="391" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 72 (P. G., LXXVII, 345).</note>, shall we think
               that thereby some pollution and stain of heresy was inflicted on the oblation of the
               orthodox<note type="footnote" n="392" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note>? By no means. If we search into this, there is no time at which
               we shall see the church to be pure. If is already well-known that such things have not and never
               will cause any injury to the whole fulness of the body of Christ. In fact in Leviticus we find
               something like this written, where it is dealing with the pollution that is caused to anything
               by a dead body, as follows: "And all food that ye shall eat on which water shall come, and there
               fall upon it any of these dead things, it is pollution; and every drink that ye shall drink in
               any vessel is polluted. However of<note type="footnote" n="393" resp="#ebrooks">Thus
                  meaninglessly has the translator rendered the genitive after <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλήν</foreign>.</note> springs of water and of pools and of cisterns of water they shall be
               pure"<note type="footnote" n="394" resp="#ebrooks">Leviticus xi, 24-26.</note>. What then is it that
               is made known to us by this? That, when certain men are by themselves, in a church for instance
               or in one <pb n="143"/> city, or in monasteries perhaps make mention of the names of those who
               are under suspicion and of dead men, like the similarly small amount of water contained in a
               vessel they are polluted by the mention, as if something dead were falling; but, when churches
               of many provinces<note type="footnote" n="395" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαρχίας</foreign>(for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαρχίας</foreign>).</note> and of dioceses
               are held in one bond of faith, and resemble fair fountains and pools and cisterns of water, the
               dead thing which has the property of polluting if it fall cannot injure; for it is swamped by
               the flow, and by the abundance of many streams. I have said these things in order to show from
               the God-inspired Scripture, and from the bishops, the pastors, the upholders of right reason,
               that in such matters observance of every point is endless, and that mention of this kind<note
                  type="footnote" n="396" resp="#ebrooks">This is the sense required.</note> does no injury to
               the fair body of the church. But your sanctity should know that we have by a letter made the
               above project known to the saintly Dioscorus also, bishop of Alexandria<note type="footnote"
                  n="397" resp="#ebrooks">Preserved in Select Letters of Severus, iv, 3. The date is therefore
                  516.</note>, since we considered his assent also most necessary. </p>
