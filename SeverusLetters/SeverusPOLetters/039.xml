            <p>When I took in my hands the letter that has now been addressed to me by your holinesses, I
               began to read it with such pleasure as if a son were seeing his father's face after the lapse of
               a long time. But after reading it I knew you better from the contents; for I found the letter to
               be in reality wholly occupied with fatherly reproofs; for it is often a habit of fathers also to
               apply unfounded <pb n="124"/> reproofs to sons in order to make them more<note type="footnote"
                  n="333"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> industrious and vigilant; but, when
               they see them making a wise defence to the accusation and dissipating the reproofs, then they
               exchange the desire of fault-finding for the desire of natural affection, and are filled with
               tears and exult from joy, and submit to a defeat that they have made an object of much prayer,
               and proclaim the sons' victory as their own. Accordingly listen like fathers to your son's
               defence, and judge upright judgment, and test the matter carefully as in the scales of a
               balance. You say in the letter that we departed from the strict rule in making union with the
               Isaurians, because Philoxenus, when he wrote to them in the course of the controversy, testified
               that there is nothing wanting in the edict<note type="footnote" n="334" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
                  xml:lang="grc">ἤδικτον</foreign>, i. c. the Henotikon, and so wherever 'edict' occurs in the
                  translation.</note>, and said that he was in communion with the prelate of Alexandria<note
                     type="footnote" n="335" resp="#ebrooks">Cf. Select Letters of Severus, p. 20. </note>, and did
               not omit the names of the heretics. Tell me what blame this casts upon the Isaurians, since they
               are shown to have summoned Philoxenus by letter to the high standard of their profession, and,
               when he would not at that time rise to their height and range himself on the side of strictness,
               together with the others to have left those who were in communion with <pb n="125"/> Flavian who
               previously held the see of Antioch, and united with us only, and exposed in writing the
               imperfection of the edict, and professed that they would not otherwise enter into communion with
               the chief of the Alexandrines until he first made a defence to the orthodox<note type="footnote"
                  n="336" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note> in common and
               removed from the midst the scandals which separate us from him. How then do you find fault with
               them as if they had neglected these things, things which they were in fact careful to put in
               writing? If to write to Philoxenus and summon him to the perfect standard is a cause of blame in
               them, it is time for us to blame some of you also who in the royal city urged us to go [to]
               Philoxenus and examine him, and to bring serious accusations against the [holy] Cyril because he
               wrote to Acacius the prelate of Berrhoea, when he advised him to disavow the 12 chapters<note
                  type="footnote" n="337" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαια</foreign>.</note> and
               the other works against Nestorius. But it is not receiving a letter from men who are involved in
               heresies, or otherwise not of a perfect mind, which subjects us to blame, but adhering to the
               things written by [them], and not walking in a contrary direction. I am much <pb n="126"/>
               astonished at that part of your [letter in which after] saying that the edict is imperfect you
               write lower down, "We, [when] in the chapters<note type="footnote" n="338" resp="#ebrooks"
                  ><foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαια</foreign>.</note> which we presented to the prelate of the
               men of Jerusalem we said that the edict contains a [right] profession of faith, said so as a
               concession, not as the truth". How then is it imperfect, if in truth it does not contain a right
               profession, and does not remove the scandals from the midst? That which is imperfect contains at
               any rate some part [agreeing with] that which is perfect, so that [that] which is wanting for
               perfection may be restored: but that [which] contains nothing sound [even] in part is not
               imperfect but entirely [false]<note type="footnote" n="339" resp="#ebrooks"> This is the sense
                  required.</note> and is the same as that which does not exist. [But] how is it that you, when
               writing to father Stephen the Isaurian of religious memory, imitated what was [formerly] said as
               a concession, and said, "The edict contains a right profession of faith"? Or how is it that the
               God-loving fathers in Egypt reject the written testament<note type="footnote" n="340"
                  resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαθηκη</foreign>.</note> of defence which remained
               with them as they say from father John the archimandrite and bishop who is among the saints,
               [which] is composed of the actual bare words of the edict? Or rather<note type="footnote"
                  n="341"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note>, to <pb n="127"/> cite the very words
               themselves, let someone proceed to say what heresy it introduces when it is said, "For we say
               that both the miracles and the passions, which he underwent voluntarily in the flesh, belong to
               one only Son of God", and again, "Because the true and sinless Incarnation from the God-bearer
               did not bring about an addition of a Lord; for the Trinity remained a Trinity even when one of
               the Trinity, God the Word, became incarnate"<note type="footnote" n="342" resp="#ebrooks"
                  >Evagr., iii, 14.</note>. But perhaps you will say that the words are rightly expressed and
               free from blame, but are not sufficient to demolish the scandals; for, inasmuch as they are
               ambiguously expressed, even those also who call the one Christ two natures profess them, since
               [they confess] the form<note type="footnote" n="343" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                  >σχῆμα</foreign>.</note> which they call the Son who became incarnate to be one and the same
               in identity of honour, in identity of name in that he is of the same [essence], in authority, as
               we ourselves elsewhere stated, when convicting the edict of ambiguity; but we ought not to open
               a door to impiety by ambiguity in what we write, according to the words of Gregory the
               Theologian, "For this is a common sandal which is put on both feet; this is an image which looks
               at everyone who passes; a sifting which [sifts out] everything"<note type="footnote" n="344"
                  resp="#ebrooks">I cannot find the source of this citation. </note>. But this argument is then
               [sound]<note type="footnote" n="345" resp="#ebrooks">This is the sense required.</note>
               <pb n="128"/> when the ambiguity is introduced [and the] truth condemned, [for accuracy] is then
               expelled and banished, [like that which] was done by the synod which the holy [Athanasius]
               termed 'an assembly of Caiaphas'<note type="footnote" n="346" resp="#ebrooks">The synod must be
                  either that of Nice (p. 134) or that of Constantinople in 360 (p. 130), and the author can
                  hardly be other than Athanasius; but I cannot find the passage, unless it be De Syn.,
                  20.</note>, [when it introduced] the expression 'like' and removed [that of] co-essentiality,
               in order that the Arians might understand the word 'like' to mean 'resembling'<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">...</supplied></damage> and the orthodox<note type="footnote" n="347" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
                     xml:lang="grc">ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note> 'that which is of the same essence'<note
                        type="footnote" n="348" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and
               'that which does not vary in anything'. But, if, when it pronounced that [the Son] is like the
               Father, it had added, 'that is identical [in] essence<note type="footnote" n="348"
                  resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> with the Father', it would by
               the addition have limited the expression of likeness which is [common] to both and eradicated
               the error arising from the ambiguity. So also a man who accepts the right confession of the
               edict, if it is enough for him, and he does not add the exact words which remove the heresy,
               opens a door to impiety through the ambiguity of the written words, and falls under the
               sentences of the holy Gregory in that he is doing detriment to the truth. But, if besides the
               edict he both confesses one incarnate nature of God the Word and anathematizes those who speak
               of two natures after the union, and the operations and properties of these, and all the impiety
               that was <pb n="129"/> confirmed at Chalcedon, he has removed the danger<note type="footnote"
                  n="349" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνδυνος</foreign>.</note> that is expected
               from the ambiguity, and has bound the understanding of both parties under the yoke of
               exactitude, and has also followed the law of Gregory the Theologian who in the 3rd letter to
               Cledonius wrote thus: "Since therefore the same expressions when rightly understood are
               consistent with religion, but when badly interpreted contain foul impiety, what wonder is it if
               we accepted the words of Vitalis also in a more religious sense, for so our object urges, while
               others are furious against the sense of the things written?"<note type="footnote" n="350"
                  resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 103 (P. G., XXXVII, 199).</note> Let us therefore acquiesce in the
               spiritual distinctions of Gregory the Theologian, and shun ambiguity only when it stands alone,
               and by the double meaning inflicts injury on the truth; but, when it is made subservient to
               accuracy by the addition of more perfect statements, let us accept it. This same teaching is
               given by Basil also who has the same spirit as Gregory in the epistle which he wrote to Maximus
               the philosopher, the words being as follows: "But for my part I must call what is yours
               mine<note type="footnote" n="351" resp="#ebrooks">Bas. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγώ δὲ εἰ χρή
                  τοὐμόν ἴδιον εἰπεῖν</foreign>.</note>. As to the term 'like in essence', if it has added
               'without variation', I accept the expression, as <pb n="130"/> coming to the same thing as
               co-essentiality, that is, according to the sound meaning of the expression 'co-essentiality',
               which those at Nicaea also understood, when they called the Only one 'Light of Light', 'true God
               of true God', and similar things, and consequently introduced the expression 'co-essentiality'.
               But it is never possible for us to imagine any difference between light and light, or between
               truth and truth, or between the essence of the Only one and that of the Father. If anyone
               therefore takes it as I have said, I accept the expression. But, if anyone severs 'without
               variation' from 'like', as those at Constantinople<note type="footnote" n="352" resp="#ebrooks"
                  >In 360: see p. 128, n. 1.</note> did, I am suspicious of the phrase, as diminishing the glory
               of the Only one. For even in the case of things that resemble in a few points also, and are very
               much inferior to the originals, we are accustomed often to use the expression 'like'"<note
                  type="footnote" n="353" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 9, 3 (P. G., XXXII, 269). </note>. In accordance
               therefore with these enactments of the fathers, since a mention of the edict was once inserted
               in the defence of the Isaurians, we have accepted it, because the whole evil-doing that is
               contrived by the ambiguity was removed by the very fact that the things that are lacking were
               added, <pb n="131"/> and a clear defence was made to us that exposed the imperfection of the
               edict. These things I was desirous to write, not out of self-seeking<note type="footnote"

               inserted in the letter a portion of what has often been addressed by me in laborious arguments
               to many who maintained that the edict sufficed for a defence. It is not as one might think
               because we cling to the memory of the edict that we are compelled to employ words of this kind,
               nor because we wish to oppose you; but, since by reason of our sins 'we have been made a
               spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men', as the wise Paul says<note type="footnote"
                  n="355" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. iv, 9.</note>, and we are henceforth set under the eyes of
               everyone, we must speak the words of truth to everyone alike, and guard ourselves beforehand
               against causes of blame even from all quarters, and use the examples and God-inspired teachings
               of the holy fathers to guide us in what is right, and not love laughter and show ourselves
               betrayers of lawful accuracy, nor yet incur blame for lack of learning and spring beyond the
               bounds of the wrestling-space, but wisely consider the saying of Koheleth, "There is a righteous
               man who perisheth in his righteousness"<note type="footnote" n="356" resp="#ebrooks">Eccl., vii,

               that he will choose for us a quiet spot suited for our purpose, so that we may not be annoyed by
