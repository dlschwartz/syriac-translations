               characteristics of the natures from which Christ is. But, if we speak of two natures
               after the union, which necessarily exist in singleness and separately, as if divided
               into a duality, but united by a conjunction of brotherhood (if we ought to call such
               a thing unity), the notion of difference reaches to the extent of division, and does
               not stop at natural characteristics.</p></div>

               <p>But, since it is a habit of the enemies of the truth to hurl accusations at <pb
                     n="30"/> us of things which are the opposite of their evil opinions, and to
                  charge us with holding some mixture or blending or confusion or phantasy in the
                  divine and ineffable Humanization, after common deliberation we have decided to
                  make clear by a limitation and distinction what was stated by you without
                  limitation. You say of the mystery of Christ that you do not recognise the
                  difference of the natures, nor yet their individuality, since with 'difference'
                  you understand also 'division'. Hence also you clearly laid down the following by
                  way of a canon: "When therefore we seek to separate and distinguish rational
                  nature from irrational, and suprasensual from perceptible, and created from
                  uncreated, together with the difference between these things we also make a
                  separation and division". These statements have been made by you as well and
                  wisely as possible, that, where there is rational and irrational, or perceptible
                  and suprasensual, or created arid uncreated, each of them remains by itself, and
                  appears in its own hypostasis, that is, has an individual and separate and
                  distinct existence; for here with difference is understood also division, and
                  again from the difference of the qualities which naturally belong to each singly
                  we recognise <pb n="31"/> division. When therefore out of things that differ in
                  kind and are not of one essence<note type="footnote" n="75" resp="#ebrooks"
                        ><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> with one another, the
                  suprasensual I mean and the perceptible, a combination or natural union takes
                  place in order to make up one animal, as we see in the case of a man, the division
                  into two ceases, for of this the notion of unity does not admit, but the
                  difference and individuality as it were in the natural characteristics of the
                  elements which have come together into one is preserved, since the body has not
                  refused to be body, nor has the soul passed into the nature of the body. The same
                  thing, and something higher, is understood with regard to Emmanuel also.<note
