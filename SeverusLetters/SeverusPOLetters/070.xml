            <p> But the words used in the 126th<note type="footnote" n="733" resp="#ebrooks">Ms.
               '120th'.</note> Psalm, which is the 8th of the Songs of Ascents, "As arrows in the hand of a
               mighty man, so are the sons of the shaken", should receive this interpretation. But the words
               contained in this statement apply also in a higher sense to each man's soul which by means of
               deeds of repentance is built up and renovated to form a holy temple of God. Those who returned
               from Babylon to this tangible and visible Jerusalem became sons of the shaken; who after
               captivity came to repentance, and by means of many trials were driven this way and that and
               shaken, and produced fruits of repentance, and thereby merited the return. But those who build
               up their own soul are in another sense sons of the shaken. <pb n="275"/> Divine Scripture calls
               the holy prophets and apostles, and all who conducted themselves like these, 'the shaken',
               because they shook out of their own soul like ashes all earthliness, whether thought or action,
               and all the likeness of the creature of dust and of the old man, and introduced into and
               impressed upon themselves instead of these the likeness of the heavenly one<note type="footnote"
                  n="734" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xv, 47-49.</note> by means of a new life, as through the mouth
               of Isaiah our Lord is introduced saying to Jerusalem, and raising her obediently (?) from
               earthly deeds, "Shake the dust from thee and rise"<note type="footnote" n="735">Is. LII,
                  2.</note>. And a garment that is shaken is not eaten by moth, and remains whole and uneaten. So
               therefore also those who by means of earnestness that is not eaten by evil things have been
               preserved for the adoption are understood to be and are called shaken. And again. Those who like
               smooth rocks that cannot be broken receive without changing the waves of this world and the
               assault of trials will therefore be understood and that very rightly to be shaken : and the sons
               of those who are shaken are the teachers of the church, who are held like arrows in the hand of
               a mighty man. For God the Lord of hosts is able to shoot those who through the same men learn
               religion, and to send into their <pb n="276"/> hearts the arrow of wisdom, the arrow of
               righteousness, the arrow of love in him, which comprises all the virtues; and through the same
               men also he shoots those too who oppose the word of truth, sending shafts of reproofs to effect
               a saving restoration if they will. To these sons of the shaken therefore, who are as arrows in
               the hand of a mighty man, he next gives a blessing, and says, "Blessed is the man who shall fill
               his desire from them"<note type="footnote" n="736" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. cxxvi, 5.</note>, for a
               blessing is given to the teacher who fills his desire by means of such arrows. But what else is
               the teacher's desire except the things that are for the profit of the souls of those that are
               saved? And this therefore should be understood not of a teacher only, but also of every
               Christian who lives virtuously, and through his own manner of life shoots everyone else as with
               arrows, and draws them to his own pattern. For those who so teach, or live, 'shall not be
               ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate'<note type="footnote" n="737"
                  resp="#ebrooks">Ibid.</note>; and the gate is the exit from this world. For, even when they
               depart from the world, and take the last journey, and are about to go to the actual presence of
               their God himself, the demons the enemies of man's life are no longer able to encounter them;
               because, when they take <pb n="277"/> the last departure, those holy ones are not silent, but
               speak with the high voice of deeds, and in company with the rulers, I mean with the good and
               angelic hosts, who come to receive them, sing songs of victory and thanksgiving, according to
               what is said in the 67th Psalm, "Rulers went in front following singers, in the midst of damsels
               beating tambourines"<note type="footnote" n="738" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. LXVII, 26.</note>. And he
               applies the expression 'damsels beating tambourines' to the souls which show youthful prowess
               over evil passions, and like tambourines have deadened the bodies and fleshly desires.</p>
