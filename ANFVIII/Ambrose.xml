         <p>A memorial<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> a which <persName>Ambrose</persName>, a chief man of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, wrote: who became a Christian, and
            all his fellow-senators raised an outcry against him; and he fled from them, and wrote
            and pointed out to them all their foolishness.</p>
         <p>Beginning his discourse,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> he answered and said:—</p>
         <p>Think not, men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, that my separation from your customs has been made without a
            just and proper reason. For I acquainted myself with all your wisdom, consisting of
            poetry, of oratory, of philosophy; and when I found not there anything agreeable to what
            is right, or that is worthy of the divine nature, I resolved to make myself acquainted
            with the wisdom of the Christians also, and to learn and see who they are, and when they
            took their rise, and what is the nature of this new and strange wisdom of theirs,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> or
            on what good hopes those who are imbued with it rely, that they speak only that which is
            true.</p>
         <p>Men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, when I came to examine the Christian writings, I found not any folly<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/>
            in them, as I had found in the celebrated Homer, who has said concerning the wars of the
            two trials:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> “Because of <persName>Helen</persName>, many of the <persName>Greeks</persName> perished at <placeName>Troy</placeName>, away from their
            beloved home.”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> For, first of all, we are told<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> concerning <persName>Agamemnon</persName> their king,
            that by reason of the foolishness of his brother <persName>Menelaus</persName>, and the violence of his
            madness, and the uncontrollable nature of his passion, he resolved to go and rescue
            <persName>Helen</persName> from the hands of a certain leprous<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> shepherd; and afterwards, when the <persName>Greeks</persName>
            had become victorious in the war, and burnt cities, and taken women and children
            captive, and the land was filled with blood, and the rivers with corpses, <persName>Agamemnon</persName>
            himself also was found to be taken captive by his passion for <persName>Briseis</persName>. <persName>Patroclus</persName>, again,
            we are told, was slain, and <persName>Achilles</persName>, the son of the goddess <persName>Thetis</persName>, mourned over him;
            <persName>Hector</persName> was dragged along the ground, and Priam and Hecuba together were weeping over the
            loss of their children; <persName>Astyanax</persName>, the son of <persName>Hector</persName>, was thrown down from the walls of
            Ilion, and his mother <persName>Andromache</persName> the mighty <persName>Ajax</persName> bore away into captivity; and that
            which was taken as booty was after a little while, all squandered in sensual
            indulgence.</p>
         <p>Of the wiles of <persName>Odysseus</persName> the son of <persName>Laertes</persName>, and of his murders, who shall tell the
            tale? For of a hundred and ten suitors did his house in one day become the grave, and it
            was filled with corpses and blood. He, too, it was that by his wickedness gained the
            praises of men, because through his pre-eminence in craft he escaped detection; he, too,
            it was who, you say, sailed upon the sea, and heard not the voice of the Sirens only
            because he stopped his ears with wax.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/></p>
         <p>The famous <persName>Achilles</persName>, again, the son of Peleus, who bounded across the river, and
            routed<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> the Trojans, and slew <persName>Hector</persName>,—this said hero of yours became the slave of
            Philoxena, and was overcome by an Amazon as she lay dead and stretched upon her bier;
            and he put off his armour, and arrayed himself in nuptial garments, and finally fell a
            sacrifice to love.</p>
         <p>Thus much concerning your great “men;”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> and thou, Homer, hadst deserved forgiveness,
            if thy silly story-telling had gone so far only as to prate about men, and not about the
            gods. As for what he says about the gods, I am ashamed even to speak of it: for the
            stories that have been invented about them are very wicked and shocking; passing
            strange,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> too, and not to be believed; and, if the truth must be told,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> fit only
            to be laughed at. For a person will be compelled to laugh when he meets with them, and
            will not believe them when he hears them. For think of gods who did not one of them
            observe the laws of rectitude, or of purity, or of modesty, but were adulterers, and
            spent their time in debauchery, and yet were not condemned to death, as they ought to
            have been!</p>
         <p>Why, the sovereign of the gods, the very “father of gods and men,” not only, as ye say,
            was an adulterer (this was but a light thing), but even slew his own father, and was a
            paederast. I will first of all speak of his adultery, though I blush to do so: for he
            appeared to Antiope as a satyr, and descended upon <persName>Danaë</persName> as a shower of gold, and became
            a bull for <persName>Europa</persName>, and a swan for Leda; whilst the love of <persName>Semele</persName>, the mother of
            <persName>Dionysus</persName>, exposed both his own ardency of passion and the jealousy of the chaste <persName>Hera</persName>.
            <persName>Ganymede the Phrygian</persName>, too, he carried off disguised as an eagle, that the fair and
            comely boy, forsooth, might serve as cup-bearer to him. This said sovereign of the gods,
            moreover killed his father <persName>Kronos</persName>, that he might seize upon his kingdom.</p>
         <p>Oh! to how many charges is the sovereign of the gods amenable,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> and how many deaths
            does he deserve to die, as an adulterer, and as a sorcerer,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> and as a paederast! Read
            to the sovereign of the gods, O men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, the law concerning parricide, and the
            condemnation pronounced on adultery, and about the shame that attaches to the vile sin
            of paederasty. How many adulterers has the sovereign of the gods indoctrinated in sin!
            Nay, how many paederasts, and sorcerers, and murderers! So that, if a man be found
            indulging his passions, he must not be put to death: because he has done this that he
            may become like the sovereign of the gods; and, if he be found a murderer, he has an
            excuse in the sovereign of the gods; and, if a man be a sorcerer, he has learned it from
            the sovereign of the gods; and, if he be a paederast, the sovereign of the gods is his
            apologist. Then, again, if one should speak of courage, <persName>Achilles</persName> was more valiant that
            this said sovereign of the gods: for he slew the man that slew his friend; but the
            sovereign of the gods wept over Sarpedon his son when he was dying, being distressed for
            him.</p>
         <p><persName>Pluto</persName>, again, who is a god, carried off <persName>Kora</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> and the mother of <persName>Kora</persName> was hurrying
            hither and thither searching for her daughter in all desert places; and, although
            <persName>Alexander Paris</persName>, when he had carried off <persName>Helen</persName>, paid the penalty of vengeance, as having
            made himself her lover by force, yet <persName>Pluto</persName>, who is a god, when he carried off <persName>Kora</persName>,
            remained without rebuke; and, although <persName>Menelaus</persName>, who is a man, knew how to search for
            <persName>Helen</persName> his wife, yet <persName>Demeter</persName>, who is a goddess, knew not where to search for <persName>Kora</persName> her
            daughter.</p>
         <p>Let <persName>Hephaestus</persName> put away jealousy from him, and not indulge resentment.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> For he was
            hated,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> because he was old and lame; while <persName>Ares</persName> was loved, because he was a youth and
            beautiful in form. There was, however, a reproof administered in respect of the
            adultery. <persName>Hephaestus</persName> was not, indeed, at first aware of the love existing between
            <persName>Venus</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> his wife and <persName>Ares</persName>; but, when he did become acquainted with it, <persName>Hephaestus</persName> said:
            “Come, see a ridiculous and senseless piece of behaviour—how to me, who am her own,
            <persName>Venus</persName>, the daughter of the sovereign of the gods, is offering insult—to me, I say, who
            am her own, and is paying honour to <persName>Ares</persName>, who is a stranger to her.” But to the
            sovereign of the gods it was not displeasing: for he loved such as were like these.
            <persName>Penelope</persName>, moreover, remained a widow twenty years, because she was expecting the return
            of her husband <persName>Odysseus</persName>, and busied herself with cunning tasks,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> and persevered in
            works of skill, while all those suitors kept pressing her to marry them; but <persName>Venus</persName>, who
            is a goddess, when <persName>Hephaestus</persName> her husband was close to her, deserted him, because she was
            overcome by love for <persName>Ares</persName>. Hearken, men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>: which of you would have dared to do
            this, or would even have endured to see it? And, if any one “should” dare to act so,
            what torture would be in store for him, or what scourgings!</p>
         <p><persName>Kronos</persName>, again, who is a god, who devoured all those children of his, was not even
            brought before a court of justice. They further tell us that the sovereign of the gods,
            his son, was the only one that escaped from him; and that the madness of <persName>Kronos</persName> his
            father was cheated of its purpose because Rhea his wife, the mother of the sovereign of
            the gods, offered him a stone in the place of the said sovereign of the gods, his son,
            to prevent him from devouring him. Hearken, men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, and reflect upon this
            madness! Why, even the dumb animal that grazes in the field knows its proper food, and
            does not touch strange food; the wild beast, too, and the reptile, and the bird, know
            their food. As for men, I need not say anything about them: ye yourselves are acquainted
            with their food, and understand it well. But <persName>Kronos</persName>, who is a god, not knowing his
            proper food, ate up a stone!</p>
         <p>Therefore, O men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, if ye will have such gods as these, do not find fault with
            one another when ye do such-like things. Be not angry with thy son when he forms the
            design to kill thee: because he thus resembles the sovereign of the gods. And, if a man
            commit adultery with thy wife, why dost thou think of him as an enemy, and yet to the
            sovereign of the gods, who is like him, doest worship and service? Why, too, dost thou
            find fault with thy wife when she has committed adultery and leads a dissolute life,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/>
            and yet payest honour to <persName>Venus</persName>, and placest her images in shrines? Persuade your <persName>Solon</persName>
            to repeal his laws; <persName>Lycurgus</persName>, also, to make no laws; let the <placeName>Areopagus</placeName> repeal<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/>
            theirs, and judge no more; and let the Athenians have councils no longer. Let the
            Athenians discharge Socrates from his office: for no one like <persName>Kronos</persName> has ever come
            before him. Let them not put to death <persName>Orestes</persName>, who killed his mother: for, lo! the
            sovereign of the gods did worse things than these to his father. <persName>Oedipus</persName> also too hastily
            inflicted mischief on himself, in depriving his eyes of sight, because he had killed his
            mother unwittingly: for he did not think about<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> the sovereign of the gods, who killed
            his father and yet remained without punishment. <persName>Medea</persName>, again, who killed her children,
            the <persName>Corinthians</persName> banish from their country; and yet they do service and honour to <persName>Kronos</persName>,
            who devoured his children. Then, too, as regards <persName>Alexander Paris</persName>—he was right in
            carrying off <persName>Helen</persName>: for he did it that he might become like <persName>Pluto</persName>, who carried off Kora.
            Let your men be set free from law, and let your cities be the abode of wanton women, and
            a dwelling-place for sorcerers.</p>
         <p>Wherefore, O men of <placeName>Greece</placeName>, seeing that your gods are grovelling like yourselves, and
            your heroes destitute of courage,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> as your dramas tell and your stories declare—then,
            again, what shall be said of the tribulations of <persName>Orestes</persName>; and the couch of <persName>Thyestes</persName>; and
            the foul taint in the family of <persName>Pelops</persName>; and concerning <persName>Danaus</persName>, who through jealousy
            killed his sons-in-law, and deprived them of offspring; the banquet of <persName>Thyestes</persName>, too,
            feeding upon the corpse set before him by way of vengeance for her whom he had wronged;
            about <persName>Procne</persName> also, to this hour screaming as she flies; her sister too, warbling, with
            her tongue cut out?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> What, moreover, is it fitting to say about the murder committed
            by <persName>Oedipus</persName>, who took his own mother to wife, and whose brothers killed one another, they
            being at the same time his sons?</p>
         <p>Your festivals, too, I hate; for there is no moderation where they are; the sweet flutes
            also, dispellers of care, which play as an incitement to dancing;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> and the
            preparation of ointments, wherewith ye anoint yourselves; and the chaplets which ye put
            on. In the abundance of your wickedness, too, ye have forgotten shame, and your
            understandings have become blinded, and ye have been infuriated<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> by the heat of
            passion, and have loved the adulterous bed.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/></p>
         <p>Had these things been said by another, perhaps our adversaries would have brought an
            accusation against him, on the plea that they were untrue. But your own poets say them,
            and your own hymns and dramas declare them.</p>
         <p>Come, therefore, and be instructed in the word of God, and in the wisdom which is
            fraught with comfort. Rejoice, and become partakers of it. Acquaint yourselves with the
            <persName>King Immortal</persName>, and acknowledge His servants. For not in arms do they make their boast,
            nor do they commit murders: because our Commander has no delight in abundance of
            strength, nor yet in horsemen and their gallant array, nor yet in illustrious descent;
            but He delights in the pure soul, fenced round by a rampart of righteousness. The word
            of God, moreover, and the promises of our good King, and the works of God, are ever
            teaching us. Oh the blessedness of the soul that is redeemed by the power of the word!
            Oh the blessedness of the trumpet of peace without war! Oh the blessedness of the
            teaching which quenches the fire of appetite! which, though it makes not poets, nor fits
            men to be philosophers, nor has among its votaries the orators of the crowd; yet
            instructs men, and makes the dead not to die, and lifts men from the earth as gods up to
            the region which is above the firmament. Come, be instructed, and be like me: for I too
            was once as ye are.</p>
         <noteGrp>
            <note xml:id="n1">This piece has much in common with the Discourse to the Greeks (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Λόγος
               πρὸς ῞Ελληνας</foreign>), ascribed by many to Justin, which is contained in vol. i. pp. 271–272
               of this series. Two things seem to be evident: (1) That neither of the two pieces is
               the original composition: for each contains something not found in the other; (2)
               That the original was in Greek: for the Syriac has in some instances evidently
               mistranslated the Greek.</note>

               justify the rendering given. <hi rend="singleQuote">Calamities,</hi> a sense the word will also bear, seems no
               easier of explanation. If we could assume the meaning to be <hi rend="singleQuote">nations</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="ln">nationes</foreign>), a
               word similar in sound to that found in the text, explaining it of heathen peoples,

               meet the difficulty. But there is no trace in this composition of a Latin influence:
