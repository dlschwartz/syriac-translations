            <head>Of the blessed Addæus the apostle. From his teaching which he gave in Edessa
               before Abgar the King and the assembly of the city.<ptr type="noteAnchor"
                  target="#n1.1"/></head>
            <p>And, when he had entered the sepulchre, he was raised to life again, and came forth
               from the sepulchre with many. And those who were guarding the sepulchre saw not how
               He came forth from the sepulchre; but the watchers from on high—they were the
               proclaimers and announcers of His resurrection. For, had He not willed, He had not
               died, because He is Lord of death, the exit from this life; nor, had it not pleased
               Him, would He have put on a body, inasmuch as He is Himself the framer of the body.
               For that will which led Him to stoop to be born of the Virgin, likewise caused Him
               further to descend to the suffering of death.—And a little after (we read): For,
               although His appearance was that of men, yet His power, and His knowledge, and his
               authority, were those of God.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <head>From the teaching of Addæus the apostle, which was spoken in the city of
                  Edessa.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2.1"/></head>
            <p>Ye know that I said unto you, that none of the souls which go forth out of the bodies
               of men are under the power of death, but that they all live and continue to exist,
               and that there are for them mansions and an abode of rest. For the reasoning power of
               the soul does not cease, nor the knowledge, because it is the image of the immortal
               God. For it is not without perceptions, after the manner of the bodily frame, which
               has no perception of that corruption which has acquired dominion over it. Recompense,
               however, and reward it will not receive apart from its bodily form, because what it
               experiences belongs not to itself alone, but to the bodily form also in which it
               dwelt for a time. But the disobedient, who have not known God, will then repent
               without avail.</p>

            <head>From the epistle of Addæus the apostle, which he spake in the city of Edessa.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3.1"/></head>
            <p>Give heed to this ministry which ye hold, and with fear and trembling continue ye in
               it, and minister every day. Minister ye not in it with neglectful habits, but with
               the discreetness of faith. And let not the praises of Christ cease out of your mouth,
               and let not any sense of weariness come over you at the season of prayers. Give heed
               to the verity which ye hold, and to the teaching of the truth which ye have received,
               and to the teaching of salvation which I commit to you. Because before the tribunal
               of Christ will it be required of you, when He maketh reckoning with the pastors and
               overseers, and when He shall take His money from the traders with the usury of what
               they have taught.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3.2"/> For He is the Son of a King,
               and goeth to receive a kingdom, and He will return and come and make a resuscitation
               to life of all men.</p>

               was from Paneus<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4.2"/>) in the days of Abgar the king.
               And, when he was among the Zophenians, Severus the son of Abgar sent and slew him at
               Agel Hasna, as also a young man his disciple.</p>

            <head>From the departure<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6.1"/>of Marath<ptr
                  type="noteAnchor" target="#n6.2"/> Mary from the world, and the birth and childhood
               of our Lord Jesus Christ. Book the Second.</head>
            <p>In the year three hundred and forty-five, in the month of the latter Tishrin,<ptr
                  type="noteAnchor" target="#n6.3"/> Marath Mary went out from her house, and went to
               the sepulchre of Christ: because every day she used to go and weep there. But the
               Jews immediately after the death of Christ seized the sepulchre, and heaped great
               stones at the door of it. And over the sepulchre and Golgotha they set guards, and
               commanded them that, if any one should go and pray at the sepulchre or at Golgotha,
               he should immediately be put to death. And the Jews took away the cross of our Lord,
               and those two other crosses, and that spear with which our Saviour was struck, and
               those nails which they drove into His hands and into His feet, and those robes of
               mockery in which He had been clad; and they hid them: lest, as they said, any one of
               the kings or of the chief persons should come and inquire concerning the putting to
               death of Christ.</p>
            <p>And the guards went in and said to the priests: Mary cometh in the evening and in the
               morning, and prayeth there. And there was a commotion in Jerusalem on account of
               Marath Mary. And the priests went to the judge, and said to him: My lord, send and
               command Mary that she go not to pray at the sepulchre and at Golgotha. And while they
               were deliberating, lo! letters came from Abgar, the king of the city of Edessa, to
               Sabina the procurator<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6.4"/> who had been appointed by
               Tiberius the emperor, and as far as the river Euphrates the procurator Sabina had
               authority. And, because Addæus the apostle, one of the seventy-two apostles, had gone
               down and built a church at Edessa, and had cured the disease with which Abgar the
               king was afflicted—for Abgar the king loved Jesus Christ, and was constantly
               inquiring about Him; and, when Christ was put to death and Abgar the king heard that
               the Jews had slain Him on the cross, he was much displeased; and Abgar arose and rode
               and came as far as the river Euphrates, because he wished to go up against Jerusalem
               and lay it waste; and, when Abgar came and was arrived at the river Euphrates, he
               deliberated in his mind: If I pass over, there will be enmity between me and Tiberius
               the emperor. And Abgar wrote letters and sent them to Sabina the procurator, and
               Sabina sent them to Tiberius the emperor. In this manner did Abgar write to Tiberius
               the emperor:—</p>
            <p>“From Abgar, the king of the city of Edessa. Much peace to thy Majesty, our lord
               Tiberius! In order that thy Majesty may not be offended with me, I have not passed
               over the river Euphrates: for I have been wishing to go up against Jerusalem and lay
               her waste, forasmuch as she has slain Christ, a skilful healer. But do thou, as a
               great sovereign who hast authority over all the earth and over us, send and do me
               judgment on the people of Jerusalem. For be it known to thy Majesty that I desire
               that thou wilt do me judgment on the crucifiers.”</p>
            <p>And Sabina received the letters, and sent them to Tiberius the emperor. And, when he
               had read them, Tiberius the emperor was greatly incensed, and he desired to destroy
               and slay all the Jews. And the people of Jerusalem heard it and were alarmed. And the
               priests went to the governor, and said to him: My lord, send and command Mary that
               she go not to pray at the sepulchre and Golgotha. The judge said to the priests: Go
               ye yourselves, and give her what command and what caution ye please.</p>
