         <p>A Letter of <persName>Mara</persName>, Son of <persName>Serapion</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></p>
         <p><persName>Mara</persName>, son of <persName>Serapion</persName>, to <persName>Serapion</persName>, my son: peace.</p>
         <p>When thy master and guardian wrote me a letter, and informed me that thou wast very
            diligent in study, though so young in years, I blessed God that thou, a little boy, and
            without a guide to direct thee, hadst begun in good earnest; and to myself also this was
            a comfort—that I heard of thee, little boy as thou art, as displaying such greatness of
            mind and conscientiousness:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> a character which, in the case of many who have begun
            well, has shown no eagerness to continue.</p>
         <p>On this account, lo, I have written for thee this record, touching that which I have by
            careful observation discovered in the world. For the kind of life men lead has been
            carefully observed by me. I tread the path of learning,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> and from the study of Greek
            philosophy<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> have I found out all these things, although they suffered shipwreck when
            the birth of life took place.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/></p>
         <p>Be diligent, then, my son, in attention to those things which are becoming for the
            free,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> so as to devote thyself to learning, and to follow after wisdom; and endeavour
            thus to become confirmed in those habits with which thou hast begun. Call to mind also
            my precepts, as a quiet person who is fond of the pursuit of learning. And, even though
            such a life should seem to thee very irksome, yet when thou hast made experience of it
            for a little while, it will become very pleasant to thee: for to me also it so happened.
            When, moreover, a person has left his home, and is able still to preserve his previous
            character, and properly does that which it behoves him to do, he is that chosen man who
            is called “the blessing of God,” and one who does not find aught else to compare with
            his freedom.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> For, as for those persons who are called to the pursuit of learning,
            they are seeking to extricate themselves from the turmoils of time; and those who take
            hold upon wisdom, they are clinging to the hope of righteousness; and those who take
            their stand on truth, they are displaying the banner of their virtue; and those who
            cultivate philosophy, they are looking to escape from the vexations of the world. And do
            thou too, my son, thus wisely behave thyself in regard to these things, as a wise person
            who seeks to spend a pure life; and beware lest the gain which many hunger after
            enervate thee, and thy mind turn to covet riches, which have no stability. For, when
            they are acquired by fraud, they do not continue; nor, even when justly obtained, do
            they last; and all those things which are seen by thee in the world, as belonging to
            that which is only for a little time, are destined to depart like a dream: for they are
            but as the risings and settings of the seasons.</p>
         <p>About the objects of that vainglory, too, of which the life of men is full, be not thou
            solicitous: seeing that from those things which give us joy there quickly comes to us
            harm. Most especially is this the case with the birth of beloved children. For in two
            respects it plainly brings us harm: in the case of the virtuous, our very affection for
            them torments us, and from their very excellence of character we suffer torture; and, in
            the case of the vicious, we are worried with their correction, and afflicted with their
            misconduct.</p>
         <p>Thou hast heard,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> moreover, concerning our companions, that, when they were leaving
            <placeName>Samosata</placeName>, they were distressed about it, and, as if complaining of the time in which
            their lot was cast, said thus: <quote>We are now far removed from our home, and we cannot
            return again to our city, or behold our people, or offer to our gods the greeting of
            praise.</quote> Meet was it that that day should be called a day of lamentation, because one
            heavy grief possessed them all alike. For they wept as they remembered their fathers,
            and they thought of their mothers<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> with sobs, and they were distressed for their
            brethren, and grieved for their betrothed whom they had left behind. And, although we
            had heard that their<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> former companions were proceeding to <placeName>Seleucia</placeName>, we clandestinely
            set out, and proceeded on the way towards them, and united our own misery with theirs.
            Then was our grief exceedingly violent, and fitly did our weeping abound, by reason of
            our desperate plight, and our wailing gathered itself into a dense cloud,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> and our
            misery grew vaster than a mountain: for not one of us had the power to ward off the
            disasters that assailed him. For affection for the living was intense, as well as sorrow
            for the dead, and our miseries were driving us on without any way of escape. For we saw
            our brethren and our children captives, and we remembered our deceased companions, who
            were laid to rest in a foreign<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> land. Each one of us, too, was anxious for himself,
            lest he should have disaster added to disaster, or lest another calamity should overtake
            that which went before it. What enjoyment could men have that were prisoners, and who
            experienced things like these?</p>
         <p>But as for thee, my beloved, be not distressed because in thy loneliness thou hast<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/>
            been driven from place to place. For to these things men are born, since they are
            destined to meet with the accidents of time. But rather let thy thought be this, that to
            wise men every place is alike, and that in every city the good have many fathers and
            mothers. Else, if thou doubt it, take thee a proof from what thou hast seen thyself. How
            many people who know thee not love thee as one of their own children; and what a host of
            women receive thee as they would their own beloved ones! Verily, as a stranger thou hast
            been fortunate; verily, for thy small love many people have conceived an ardent
            affection for thee.</p>
         <p>What, again, are we to say concerning the delusion<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> which has taken up its abode in
            the world? Both by reason of toil<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> painful is the journey through it, and by its
            agitations are we, like a reed by the force of the wind, bent now in this direction, now
            in that. For I have been amazed at many who cast away their children, and I have been
            astonished at others who bring up those that are not theirs. There are persons who
            acquire riches in the world, and I have also been astonished at others who inherit that
            which is not of their own acquisition. Thus mayest thou understand and see that we are
            walking under the guidance of delusion.</p>
         <p>Begin and tell us, O wisest of men,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> on which of his possessions a man can place
            reliance, or concerning what things he can say that they are such as abide. Wilt thou
            say so of abundance of riches? they are snatched away. Of fortresses? they are spoiled.
            Of cities? they are laid waste. Of greatness? it is brought down. Of magnificence? it is
            overthrown. Of beauty? it withers. Or of laws? they pass away. Or of poverty? it is
            despised. Or of children? they die. Or of friends? they prove false. Or of the praises
            of men? jealousy goes before them.</p>
         <p>Let a man, therefore, rejoice in his empire, like <persName>Darius</persName>; or in his good fortune, like
            <persName>Polycrates</persName>; or in his bravery, like <persName>Achilles</persName>; or in his wife, like <persName>Agamemnon</persName>; or in his
            offspring, like <persName>Priam</persName>; or in his skill, like <persName>Archimedes</persName>; or in his wisdom, like
            <persName>Socrates</persName>; or in his learning, like <persName>Pythagoras</persName>; or in his ingenuity, like <persName>Palamedes</persName>;—the
            life of men, my son, departs from the world, but their praises and their virtues abide
            for ever.</p>
         <p>Do thou, then, my little son, choose thee that which fadeth not away. For those who
            occupy themselves with these things are called modest, and are beloved, and lovers of a
            good name.</p>
         <p>When, moreover, anything untoward befalls thee, do not lay the blame on man, nor be
            angry against God, nor fulminate against the time thou livest in.</p>
         <p>If thou shalt continue in this mind, thy gift is not small which thou hast received from
            God, which has no need of riches, and is never reduced to poverty. For without fear
            shalt thou pass thy life,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> and with rejoicing. For fear and apologies for one’s
            nature belong not to the wise, but to such as walk contrary to law. For no man has even
            been deprived of his wisdom, as of his property.</p>
         <p>Follow diligently learning rather than riches. For the greater are one’s possessions,
            the greater is the evil attendant upon them. For I have myself observed that, where a
            man’s goods are many, so also are the tribulations which happen to him; and, where
            luxuries are accumulated, there also do sorrows congregate; and, where riches are
            abundant, there is stored up the bitterness of many a year.</p>
         <p>If, therefore, thou shalt behave with understanding, and shalt diligently watch over thy
            conduct, God will not refrain from helping thee, nor men from loving thee.</p>
         <p>Let that which thou art able to acquire suffice thee; and if, moreover, thou art able to
            do without property, thou shalt be called blessed, and no man whatsoever shall be
            jealous of thee.</p>
         <p>And remember also this, that nothing will disturb thy life very greatly, except it be
            the love of gain; and that no man after his death is called an owner of property:
            because it is by the desire of this that weak men are led captive, and they know not
            that a man dwells among his possessions only in the manner of a chance-comer, and they
            are haunted with fear because these possessions are not secured to them: for they
            abandoned that which is their own, and seek that which is not theirs.</p>
         <p>What are we to say, when the wise are dragged by force by the hands of tyrants, and
            their wisdom is deprived of its freedom<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> by slander, and they are plundered for their
            superior intelligence, without the opportunity of making a defence? They are not wholly
            to be pitied. For what benefit did the <persName>Athenians</persName> obtain by putting <persName>Socrates</persName> to death,
            seeing that they received as retribution for it famine and pestilence? Or the people of
            Samos by the burning of <persName>Pythagoras</persName>, seeing that in one hour the whole<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> of their
            country was covered with sand? Or the Jews by the murder of their Wise King, seeing that
            from that very time their kingdom was driven away from them? For with justice did God
            grant a recompense to the wisdom of all three of them. For the <persName>Athenians</persName> died by famine;
            and the people of Samos were covered by the sea without remedy; and the Jews, brought to
            desolation and expelled from their kingdom, are driven away into every land. Nay,
            <persName>Socrates</persName> did <quote>not</quote> die, because of <persName>Plato</persName>; nor yet <persName>Pythagoras</persName>, because of the statue of
            Hera; nor yet the Wise King, because of the new laws which he enacted.</p>
         <p>Moreover I, my son, have attentively observed mankind, in what a dismal state of ruin
            they are. And I have been amazed that they are not utterly prostrated<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> by the
            calamities which surround them, and that even their wars<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> are not enough for them,
            nor the pains they endure, nor the diseases, nor the death, nor the poverty; but that,
            like savage beasts, they must needs rush upon one another in their enmity, trying which
            of them shall inflict the greater mischief on his fellow. For they have broken away from
            the bounds of truth, and transgress all honest laws, because they are bent on fulfilling
            their selfish desires; for, whensoever a man is eagerly set on obtaining that which he
            desires, how is it possible that he should fitly do that which it behoves him to do? and
            they acknowledge no restraint,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/> and but seldom stretch out their hands towards truth
            and goodness, but in their manner of life behave like the deaf<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> and the blind.
            Moreover, the wicked rejoice, and the righteous are disquieted. He that has, denies that
            he has; and he that has not, struggles to acquire. The poor seek help, and the rich hide
            their wealth, and every man laughs at his fellow. Those that are drunken are stupefied,
            and those that have recovered themselves are ashamed.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> Some weep, and some sing; and
            some laugh, and others are a prey to care. They rejoice in things evil, and a man that
            speaks the truth they despise.</p>
         <p>Should a man, then, be surprised when the world is seeking to wither him with its scorn,
            seeing that they and he have not one and the same manner of life? <quote>These</quote> are the things
            for which they care. One of them is looking forward to the time when in battle he shall
            obtain the renown of victory; yet the valiant perceive not by how many foolish objects
            of desire a man is led captive in the world. But would that for a little while
            self-repentance visited them! For, while victorious by their bravery, they are overcome
            by the power of covetousness. For I have made trial of men, and with this result: that
            the one thing on which they are intent, is abundance of riches. Therefore also it is
            that they have no settled purpose; but, through the instability of their minds, a man is
            of a sudden cast down from his elation of spirit to be swallowed up with sadness. They
            look not at the vast wealth of eternity, nor consider that every visitation of trouble
            is conducting us all alike to the same final period. For they are devoted to the majesty
            of the belly, that huge blot on the character of the vicious.</p>
         <p>Moreover, as regards this letter which it has come into my mind to write to thee, it is
            not enough to read it, but the best thing is that it be put in practice.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> For I know
            for myself, that when thou shalt have made experiment of this mode of life, it will be
            very pleasant to thee, and thou wilt be free from sore vexation; because it is only on
            account of children that we tolerate riches.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/></p>
         <p>Put, therefore, sadness away from thee, O most beloved of mankind,—a thing which never
            in anywise benefits a man; and drive care away from thee, which brings with it no
            advantage whatsoever. For we have no resource or skill that can avail us—nothing but a
            great mind able to cope with the disasters and to endure the tribulations which we are
            always receiving at the hands of the times. For at these things does it behove us to
            look, and not only at those which are fraught with rejoicing and good repute.</p>
         <p>Devote thyself to wisdom, the fount of all things good, the treasure that faileth not.
            There shalt thou lay thy head, and be at ease. For this shall be to thee father and
            mother, and a good companion for thy life.</p>
         <p>Enter into closest intimacy with fortitude and patience, those virtues which are able
            successfully to encounter the tribulations that befall feeble men. For so great is their
            strength, that they are adequate to sustain hunger, and can endure thirst, and mitigate
            every trouble. With toil, moreover, yea even with dissolution, they make right
            merry.</p>
         <p>To these things give diligent attention, and thou shalt lead an untroubled life, and I
            also shall have comfort,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> and thou shalt be called <quote>the delight of his parents.</quote></p>
         <p>For in that time of yore, when our city was standing in her greatness, thou mayest be
            aware that against many persons among us abominable words were uttered; but for
            ourselves,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> we acknowledged long ago that we received love, no less than honour, to
            the fullest extent from the multitude of her people: it was the state of the times only
            that forbade our completing those things which we had resolved on doing.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> And here
            also in the prison-house we give thanks to God that we have received the love of many:
            for we are striving to our utmost to maintain a life of sobriety and cheerfulness;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/>
            and, if anyone drive us by force, he will but be bearing public testimony against
            himself, that he is estranged from all things good, and he will receive disgrace and
            shame from the foul mark of shame that is upon him. For we have shown our truth—that
            truth which in our now ruined kingdom we possessed not.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> But, if the <persName>Romans</persName> shall
            permit us to go back to our own country, as called upon by justice and righteousness to
            do, they will be acting like humane men, and will earn the name of good and righteous,
            and at the same time will have a peaceful country in which to dwell: for they will
            exhibit their greatness when they shall leave us free men, and we shall be obedient to
            the sovereign power which the time has allotted to us. But let them not like tyrants,
            drive us as though we were slaves. Yet, if it has been already determined what shall be
            done, we shall receive nothing more dreadful than the peaceful death which is in store
            for us.</p>
         <p>But thou, my little son, if thou resolve diligently to acquaint thyself with these
            things, first of all put a check on appetite, and set limits to that in which thou art
            indulging. Seek the power to refrain from being angry; and, instead of yielding to
            outbursts of passion, listen to the promptings of kindness.</p>
         <p>For myself, what I am henceforth solicitous about is this—that, so far as I have
            recollections of the past, I may leave behind me a book containing them, and with a
            prudent mind finish the journey which I am appointed to take, and depart without
            suffering out of the sad afflictions of the world. For my prayer is, that I may receive
            my dismissal; and by what kind of death concerns me not. But, if any one should be
            troubled or anxious about this, I have no counsel to give him: for yonder, in the
            dwelling-place of all the world, will he find us before him.</p>
         <p>One of his friends asked <persName>Mara</persName>, son of <persName>Serapion</persName>, when in bonds at his side: <quote>Nay, by thy
            life, <persName>Mara</persName>, tell me what cause of laughter thou hast seen, that thou laughest.</quote> <quote>I am

               a passive, and render: <hi rend="singleQuote">It (the kind of life men lead) has been explored by me by

            <note xml:id="n5">The meaning probably is, that the maxims referred to lost their
               importance for him when he entered upon the new life of a Christian (so Cureton), or
               their importance to mankind when Christianity itself was born into the world. But why
               he did not substitute more distinctive Christian teaching is not clear. Perhaps the
               fear of persecution influenced him.</note>

            <note xml:id="n7">Cureton’s less literal rendering probably gives the true sense: “with
