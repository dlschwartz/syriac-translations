         <head>A Homily on Guria and Shamuna, Composed by Mar Jacob.</head>
         <l>Shamuna and Guria, martyrs who made themselves illustrious in their afflictions,</l>
         <l>Have in love required of me to tell of their illustrious deeds.</l>
         <l>To champions of the faith the doctrine calleth me,</l>
         <l>That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</l>
         <l>Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,</l>
         <l>Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their conflicts:—</l>
         <l>Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,</l>
         <l>And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:</l>
         <l>Those who were the salt of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,</l>
         <l>And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through unbelief:</l>
         <l>Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,</l>
         <l>By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:</l>
         <l>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing</l>
         <l>Of every kind of error, the lights were not put out;</l>
         <l>Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured</l>
         <l>In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:</l>
         <l>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence</l>
         <l>Against all spoilers in all the wars that surrounded us:</l>
         <l>Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,</l>
         <l>And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of succour:</l>
         <l>Two precious pearls, which were</l>
         <l>An ornament for the bride of my lord Abgar, the Aramaean’s son.</l>
         <l>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,</l>
         <l>And whose faith was known by their sufferings.</l>
         <l>On their bodies they wrote the story of the Son of God</l>
         <l>With the marks of combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</l>
         <l>They showed their love, not by words of the mouth alone,</l>
         <l>But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</l>
         <l>For the love of the Son of God they gave up their bodies:</l>
         <l>Since it beseemeth the lover that for his love he should give up himself.</l>
         <l>Fire and sword proved their love, how true it was;</l>
         <l>And more beautiful than silver tried in a furnace of earth were their necks.</l>
         <l>They looked on God, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,</l>
         <l>Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His sake.</l>
         <l>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;</l>
         <l>And they were enlightened by it, and with His light chased they away the darkness.</l>
         <l>At the idols of vanity, which error had brought in, they laughed,</l>
         <l>Instinct with the faith of the Son of God which is full of light.</l>
         <l>The love of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;</l>
         <l>Nor could all the brambles of idolatry stand before it.</l>
         <l>Fixed was their love on God unchangeably:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></l>
         <l>And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> all athirst as it was for
            blood.</l>
         <l>With guilelessness and yet with wisdom stood they in the judgment-hall,</l>
         <l>As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is true.</l>
         <l>Despising as they did kindred and family, guileless were they;</l>
         <l>Forasmuch, also, as possessions and wealth were held in no account by them.</l>
         <l>Nor guileless only: for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents too</l>
         <l>They were heedful of the faith of the house of God.</l>
         <l>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,</l>
         <l>But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:</l>
         <l>And, so long as his head is kept from harm, his life abideth in him;</l>
         <l>But, if the head be struck, his life is left a prey to destruction.</l>
         <l>The head of the soul is men’s faith;</l>
         <l>And, if this be preserved unharmed, by it is also preserved their life:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/></l>
         <l>Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,</l>
         <l>Yet, so long as faith is preserved, the soul is alive;</l>
         <l>But, if faith is struck down by unbelief,</l>
         <l>Lost is the soul, and life has perished from the man.</l>
         <l>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as men<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/></l>
         <l>Were heedful, that it should not be struck down by persecutors:</l>
         <l>For they knew that, if faith is preserved,</l>
         <l>Both soul and body are preserved from destruction.</l>
         <l>And, because of this, touching their faith were they solicitous,</l>
         <l>That that should not be struck down in which their very life was hidden.</l>
         <l>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/></l>
         <l>Yea to every kind of torture, that their faith should not be stricken down;</l>
         <l>And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,</l>
         <l>So hid they their faith within their hearts;</l>
         <l>And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:</l>
         <l>But overthrown was not their faith which was within their hearts.</l>
         <l>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death when it speaks,</l>
         <l>And with the tongue, as with a sword, worketh slaughter.</l>
         <l>And from it spring up both life and death to men:</l>
         <l>Denying a man dies, confessing he lives, and the mouth hath power over it.</l>
         <l>Denial is death, and in confession is the soul’s life;</l>
         <l>And power hath the mouth over them both, like a judge.</l>
         <l>The word of the mouth openeth the door for death to enter in;</l>
         <l>This, too, calleth for life, and it beameth forth upon the man.</l>
         <l>Even the robber by one word of faith</l>
         <l>Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> all fraught with blessings.</l>
         <l>The wicked judges too, from the martyrs, the sons of the right hand,</l>
         <l>Demanded that by word of mouth only they should blaspheme;</l>
         <l>But, like true men holding fast the faith,</l>
         <l>They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</l>
         <l>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is adequate to tell of thee?</l>
         <l>All too narrow is my mouth for thy praise, too mean for thee to be spoken of by it.</l>
         <l>Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy suffering, thy wealth thy stripes,</l>
         <l>And by reason of thy blows magnificent is the beauty of thy championship.</l>
         <l>Proud of thee is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:</l>
         <l>Since wealth art thou to us, and a coveted store which cannot be stolen from us.</l>
         <l>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our faith,</l>
         <l>Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy beauties divine?</l>
         <l>Lo! tortures on thy body are set like gems of beryl,</l>
         <l>And the sword on thy neck like a chain of choice gold.</l>
         <l>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of glory full of beauty,</l>
         <l>And the scourging of thy back a vesture with which the sun may not compare.</l>
         <l>Radiant thou art and comely by virtue of these thy sufferings, so abounding;</l>
         <l>And resplendent are thy beauties, because of the pains which are so severe upon
            thee.</l>
         <l>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou than the rich:</l>
         <l>For lo! the rich stand at thy door, that thou mayest relieve them.</l>
         <l>Small thy village, poor thy country: who, then, gave thee</l>
         <l>That lords of villages and cities should court thy favour?</l>
         <l>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</l>
         <l>Take dust from thy threshold, as though it were the medicine of life.</l>
         <l>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increaseth riches;</l>
         <l>And its poverty despiseth all the riches of the world.</l>
         <l>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor, lo! at your doors</l>
         <l>Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you supplies for their wants.</l>
         <l>The Son of God in poverty and want</l>
         <l>Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,</l>
         <l>His disciples, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,</l>
         <l>All men of little note, became illustrious through His faith.</l>
         <l>One fisherman, whose “village” too was a home of fishermen,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/></l>
         <l>He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/></l>
         <l>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,</l>
         <l>He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the faith.</l>
         <l>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not wealthy,</l>
         <l>And lo! in a great city became they lords;</l>
         <l>And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,</l>
         <l>And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</l>
         <l>From their confession of the faith of the Son of God</l>
         <l>These blessed men acquired riches beyond compute.</l>
         <l>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;</l>
         <l>And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</l>
         <l>The chosen martyrs did battle against error,</l>
         <l>And in the confession of the Son of God stood they firm like valiant men.</l>
         <l>They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/></l>
         <l>That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His Father.</l>
         <l>There arose against them the war of pagans like a tempest;</l>
         <l>But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</l>
         <l>They were required to sacrifice to lifeless images,</l>
         <l>But they departed not from their confession of the Son of God.</l>
         <l>The wind of idolatry blew in their faces,</l>
         <l>But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</l>
         <l>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched at them;</l>
         <l>But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.</l>
         <l>The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;</l>
         <l>But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to flight.</l>
         <l>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,</l>
         <l>Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</l>
         <l>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/></l>
         <l>How they went up from the contest covered with glory?</l>
         <l>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;</l>
         <l>Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</l>
         <l>The judge menaced them, and multiplied his words of threatening;</l>
         <l>And recounted tortures and all kinds of inflictions, that he might terrify them.</l>
         <l>He spake great words,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> that by fright and intimidation,</l>
         <l>By menaces too, he might incline them to sacrifice.</l>
         <l>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,</l>
         <l>And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;</l>
         <l>And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,</l>
         <l>And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;</l>
         <l>For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all evil things,</l>
         <l>And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.</l>
         <l>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,</l>
         <l>Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to sacrifice.</l>
         <l>Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they it:</l>
         <l>For they knew that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty increase;</l>
         <l>And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,</l>
         <l>The more did they show their contempt of him, having no fear of his threats.</l>
         <l>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;</l>
         <l>And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for him.</l>
         <l>By those things which he told them he tried to frighten them to sacrifice;</l>
         <l>And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</l>
         <l>Truth is wiser than wise words,</l>
         <l>And very hateful, however much it may be adorned, is falsehood.</l>
         <l>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking truth,</l>
         <l>While the judge continued to utter falsehood.</l>
         <l>And therefore were they not afraid of his threatening,</l>
         <l>Because all his menaces against the truth were accounted by them as empty sound.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/></l>
         <l>The intercourse of the world they despised, they contemned and scorned, yea they
            abandoned;</l>
         <l>And to return to it they had no wish, or to enter it again.</l>
         <l>From the place of judgment they set their faces to depart</l>
         <l>To that meeting-place for them all, the life of the new world.</l>
         <l>They cared neither for possessions nor for houses,</l>
         <l>Nor for the advantages of this world, so full of evil.</l>
         <l>In the world of light was their heart bound captive with God,</l>
         <l>And to “that” country did they set their face to depart;</l>
         <l>And they looked to the sword, to come and be a bridge</l>
         <l>To let them pass over to God, for whom they were longing.</l>
         <l>This world they accounted as a little tent,</l>
         <l>But that yonder as a city full of beauties;</l>
         <l>And they were in haste by the sword to depart hence</l>
         <l>To the land of light, which is full of blessing for those who are worthy of it.</l>
         <l>The judge commanded to hang them up by their arms,</l>
         <l>And without mercy did they stretch them out in bitter agony.</l>
         <l>A demon’s fury breathed rage into the heart of the judge,</l>
         <l>And embittered him against the stedfast ones, inciting him to crush them;</l>
         <l>And between the height and the depth he stretched them out to afflict them:</l>
         <l>And they were a marvel to both sides, when they saw how much they endured.</l>
         <l>At the old men’s frame heaven and earth marvelled,</l>
         <l>To see how much suffering it bore nor cried out for help under their affliction.</l>
         <l>Hung up and dragged along are their feeble bodies by their arms,</l>
         <l>Yet is there deep silence, nor is there one that cries out for help or that murmurs.</l>
         <l>Amazed were all who beheld their contests,</l>
         <l>To see how calmly the outstretched forms bore the inflictions laid upon them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/></l>
         <l>Amazed too was Satan at their spotless frames,</l>
         <l>To see what weight of affliction they sustained without a groan.</l>
         <l>Yea, and gladdened too were the angels by that fortitude of theirs,</l>
         <l>To see how patiently it bore that contest so terrible that was.</l>
         <l>But, as combatants who were awaiting their crowns,</l>
         <l>There entered no sense of weariness into their minds.</l>
         <l>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary; yea, he was astonished:</l>
         <l>But the noble men before him felt no weariness in their afflictions.</l>
         <l>He asked them whether they would consent to sacrifice;</l>
         <l>But the mouth was unable to speak from pain.</l>
         <l>Thus did the persecutors increase their inflictions,</l>
         <l>Until they gave no place for the word to be spoken.</l>
         <l>Silent was the mouth from the inflictions laid on their limbs;</l>
         <l>But the will, like that of a hero, was nerved with fortitude from itself.</l>
         <l>Alas for the persecutors! how destitute were they of righteousness!</l>
         <l>But the children of light—how were they clad in faith!</l>
         <l>They demand speech, when there is no place for speaking,</l>
         <l>Since the word of the mouth was forbidden them by pain.</l>
         <l>Fast bound was the body, and silent the mouth, and it was unable</l>
         <l>To utter the word when unrighteously questioned.</l>
         <l>And what should the martyr do, who had no power to say,</l>
         <l>When he was questioned, that he would not sacrifice?</l>
         <l>All silent were the old men full of faith,</l>
         <l>And from pain they were incapable of speaking.</l>
         <l>Yet questioned they were: and in what way, if a man is silent</l>
         <l>When he is questioned, shall he assent to that which is said?</l>
         <l>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,</l>
         <l>Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behoved them to speak.</l>
         <l>Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they showed</l>
         <l>The resolve of the new man that was within.</l>
         <l>Their heads hung down, signifying amidst their pains</l>
         <l>That they were not going to sacrifice, and every one understood their meaning.</l>
         <l>As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they confess;</l>
         <l>But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spake with a dumb sign.</l>
         <l>Of faith they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:</l>
         <l>So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were alike stedfast.</l>
         <l>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,</l>
         <l>And how straight to him that desires to walk in it?</l>
         <l>Who but must marvel to see that, when the will is watchful and ready,</l>
         <l>It is very broad and full of light to him that goeth therein?</l>
         <l>About the path are ditches; full also is it of pitfalls;</l>
         <l>And, if one turn but a little aside from it, a ditch receives him.</l>
         <l>That dumb sign only is there between the right and the left,</l>
         <l>And on “Yea” and “Nay” stand<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> sin and righteousness.</l>
         <l>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they would not
            sacrifice,</l>
         <l>And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to Eden;</l>
         <l>And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little</l>
         <l>Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.</l>
         <l>Upwards they made a sign, to signify that upwards were they prepared to ascend;</l>
         <l>And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.</l>
         <l>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:</l>
         <l>They made a sign that they would not sacrifice, and they inherited the place of the
            kingdom.</l>
         <l>Even while they were silent they were advocates for the Son of God:</l>
         <l>For not in multitude of words doth faith consist.</l>
         <l>That fortitude of theirs was a full-voiced confession,</l>
         <l>And as though with open mouth declared they their faith by signs;</l>
         <l>And every one knew what they were saying, though silent,</l>
         <l>And enriched and increased was the faith of the house of God;</l>
         <l>And error was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they spake not,</l>
         <l>Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their faith stood fast.</l>
         <l>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,</l>
         <l>And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,</l>
         <l>And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,</l>
         <l>And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,</l>
         <l>Yet null and void became the command and drowned was the voice of the judge,</l>
         <l>And without speech the mute sign of the martyrs bore off the palm.</l>
         <l>Talking and clamour, and the sound of stripes, on the left;</l>
         <l>And deep silence and suffering standing on the right;</l>
         <l>And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their heads,</l>
         <l>The head of faith was lifted up, and error was put to shame.</l>
         <l>Worsted in the encounter were they who spoke, and the victory was to the silent:</l>
         <l>For, voiceless they uttered by signs the discourse of faith.</l>
         <l>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;</l>
         <l>And they put them in bonds, threatening yet to vanquish them.</l>
         <l>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the martyrs</l>
         <l>Held of no account—yea rather as the light which has no end.</l>
         <l>To be without bread, and without water, and without light,</l>
         <l>Pleased them well, because of the love of the Son of God.</l>
         <l>The judge commanded by their feet to hang them up</l>
         <l>With their heads downwards, by a sentence all unrighteous:</l>
         <l>Hanged up was Shamuna with his head downwards; and he prayed</l>
         <l>In prayer pure and strained clear by pain.</l>
         <l>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in that judgment-hall,</l>
         <l>And its taste and smell made the very denizens of heaven to marvel.</l>
         <l>Afflicted was his body, but sound was his faith;</l>
         <l>Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his prayer over his deed.</l>
         <l>For, prayer nothing whatsoever turneth aside,</l>
         <l>And nothing hindereth it—not even sword, not even fire.</l>
         <l>His form was turned upside down, but his prayer was unrestrained,</l>
         <l>And straight was its path on high to the abode of the angels.</l>
         <l>The more the affliction of the chosen martyr was increased,</l>
         <l>The more from his lips was all confession heard.</l>
         <l>The martyrs longed for the whetted sword affectionately,</l>
         <l>And sought it as a treasure full of riches.</l>
         <l>A new work has the Son of God wrought in the world—</l>
         <l>That dreadful death should be yearned for<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> by many.</l>
         <l>That men should run to meet the sword is a thing unheard of,</l>
         <l>Except they were those whom Jesus has enlisted in His service by His crucifixion.</l>
         <l>That death is bitter, every one knoweth lo! from earliest time:</l>
         <l>To martyrs alone is it not bitter to be slain.</l>
         <l>They laughed at the whetted sword when they saw it,</l>
         <l>And greeted it with smiles: for it was that which was the occasion of their crowns.</l>
         <l>As though it had been something hated, they left the body to be beaten:</l>
         <l>Even though loving it, they held it not back from pains.</l>
         <l>For the sword they waited, and the sword went forth and crowned them:</l>
         <l>Because for it they looked; and it came to meet them, even as they desired.</l>
         <l>The Son of God slew death by His crucifixion;</l>
         <l>And, inasmuch as death is slain, it caused no suffering to the martyrs.</l>
         <l>With a wounded serpent one playeth without fear;</l>
         <l>A slain lion even a coward will drag along:</l>
         <l>The great serpent our Lord crushed by His crucifixion;</l>
         <l>The dread lion did the Son of God slay by His sufferings.</l>
         <l>Death bound He fast, and laid him prostrate and trampled on him at the gate of
            Hades;</l>
         <l>And now whosoever will draweth near and mocketh at him, because he is slain.</l>
         <l>These old men, Shamuna and Guria, mocked at death,</l>
         <l>As at that lion which by the Son of God was slain.</l>
         <l>The great serpent, which slew Adam among the trees,</l>
         <l>Who could seize, so long as he drank not of the blood of the cross?</l>
         <l>The Son of God crushed the dragon by His crucifixion,</l>
         <l>And lo! boys and old men mock at the wounded serpent.</l>
         <l>Pierced is the lion with the spear which pierced the side of the Son of God;</l>
         <l>And whosoever will trampleth on him, yea mocketh at him.</l>
         <l>The Son of God—He is the cause of all good things,</l>
         <l>And Him doth it behove every mouth to celebrate.</l>
         <l>He did Himself espouse<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> the bride with the blood which flowed from His wounds,</l>
         <l>And of His wedding-friends He demanded as a nuptial gift<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> the blood of their
            necks.</l>
         <l>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on the cross in nakedness,</l>
         <l>And whosoever came to be a guest, He let fall His blood upon him.</l>
         <l>Shamuna and Guria gave up their bodies for His sake</l>
         <l>To sufferings and tomes and to all the various forms of woe.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/></l>
         <l>At Him they looked as He was mocked by wicked men,</l>
         <l>And thus did they themselves endure mockery without a groan.</l>
         <l>Edessa was enriched by your slaughter, O blessed ones:</l>
         <l>For ye adorned her with your crowns and with your sufferings.</l>
         <l>Her beauty are ye, her bulwark ye, her salt ye,</l>
         <l>Her riches and her store, yea her boast and all her treasure.</l>
         <l>Faithful stewards are ye:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/></l>
         <l>Since by your sufferings ye did array the bride in beauty.</l>
         <l>The daughter of the Parthians, who was espoused to the cross,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/></l>
         <l>Of you maketh her boast: since by your teaching lo! she was enlightened.</l>
         <l>Her advocates are ye; scribes who, though silent, vanquished</l>
         <l>All error, whilst its voice was uplifted high in unbelief.</l>
         <l>Those old men<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> of the daughter of the Hebrews were sons of Belial,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/></l>
         <l>False witnesses, who killed Naboth, feigning themselves to be true.</l>
         <l>Her did Edessa outdo by her two old men full of beauty,</l>
         <l>Who were witnesses to the Son of God, and died like Naboth.</l>
         <l>Two were there, and two here, old men;</l>
         <l>And these were called witnesses, and witnesses those.</l>
         <l>Let us now see which of them were witnesses chosen of God,</l>
         <l>And which city is beloved by reason of her old men and of her honourable ones.</l>
         <l>Lo! the sons of Belial who slew Naboth are witnesses;</l>
         <l>And here Shamuna and Guria, again, are witnesses.</l>
         <l>Let us now see which witnesses, and which old men,</l>
         <l>And which city can stand with confidence<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> before God.</l>
         <l>Sons of Belial were those witnesses of that adulterous woman,</l>
         <l>And lo! their shame is all portrayed in their names.</l>
         <l>Edessa’s just and righteous old men, her witnesses,</l>
         <l>Were like Naboth, who himself also was slain for righteousness’ sake.</l>
         <l>They were not like the two lying sons of Belial,</l>
         <l>Nor is Edessa like Zion, which also crucified the Lord.</l>
         <l>Like herself her old men were false, yea dared</l>
         <l>To shed on the ground innocent blood wickedly.</l>
         <l>But by these witnesses here lo! the truth is spoken.—</l>
         <l>Blessed be He who gave us the treasure-store of their crowns!</l>
