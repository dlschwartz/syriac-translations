         <head>The Teaching of <persName>Addaeus the Apostle</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></head>
         <p><persName>Addaeus</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> said to him: Because thou hast thus believed, I lay my hand upon thee in the
            name of Him in whom thou hast thus believed. And at the very moment that he laid his
            hand upon him he was healed of the plague of the disease which he had for a long
            time.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> And <persName>Abgar</persName> was astonished and marvelled, because, like as he had heard about
            <persName>Jesus</persName>, how He wrought and healed, so <persName>Addaeus</persName> also, without any medicine whatever, was
            healing in the name of <persName>Jesus</persName>. And <persName>Abdu</persName> also, son of <persName>Abdu</persName>, had the gout in his feet; and
            he also presented his feet to him, and he laid his hand upon them, and healed him, and
            he had the gout no more. And in all the city also he wrought great cures, and showed
            forth wonderful mighty-works in it.</p>
         <p><persName>Abgar</persName> said to him: Now that every man knoweth that by the power of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> thou
            doest these miracles, and lo! we are astonished at thy deeds, I therefore entreat of
            thee to relate to us the story about the coming of <persName>Christ</persName>, in what manner it was, and
            about His glorious power, and about the miracles which we have heard that He did, which
            thou hast thyself seen, together with thy fellow-disciples.</p>
         <p><persName>Addaeus</persName> said: I will not hold my peace from declaring this; since for this very purpose
            was I sent hither, that I might speak to and teach every one who is willing to believe,
            even as thou. Assemble me tomorrow all the city, and I will sow in it the word of life
            by the preaching which I will address to you—about the coming of <persName>Christ</persName>, in what manner
            it was; and about Him that sent Him, why and how He sent Him; and about His power and
            His wonderful works; and about the glorious mysteries of His coming, which He spake of
            in the world; and about the unerring truth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> of His preaching; and how and for what
            cause He abused Himself, and humbled His exalted Godhead by the manhood which He took,
            and was crucified, and descended to the place of the dead, and broke through the
            enclosure<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> which had never been broken through before, and gave life to the dead by
            being slain Himself, and descended alone, and ascended with many to His glorious Father,
            with whom He had been from eternity in one exalted Godhead.</p>
         <p>And <persName>Abgar</persName> commanded them to give to <persName>Addaeus</persName> silver and gold. <persName>Addaeus</persName> said to him: How can
            we receive that which is not ours. For, lo! that which was ours have we forsaken, as we
            were commanded by our Lord; because without purses and without scrips, bearing the cross
            upon our shoulders, were we commanded to preach His Gospel in the whole creation, of
            whose crucifixion, which was for our sakes, for the redemption of all men, the whole
            creation was sensible and suffered pain.</p>
         <p>And he related before <persName>Abgar</persName> the king, and before his princes and his nobles, and before
            <persName>Augustin</persName>, <persName>Abgar</persName>’s mother, and before <persName>Shalmath</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> the daughter of <persName>Meherdath</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> <persName>Abgar</persName>’s
            wife,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> the signs of our Lord, and His wonders, and the glorious mighty-works which He
            did, and His divine exploits, and His ascension to His Father; and how they had received
            power and authority at the same time that He was received up—by which same power it was
            that he had healed <persName>Abgar</persName>, and <persName>Abdu</persName> son of <persName>Abdu</persName>, the second person<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> of his kingdom; and
            how He informed them that He would reveal Himself at the end of the ages<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> and at the
            consummation of all created things; also of the resuscitation and resurrection which is
            to come for all men, and the separation which will be made between the sheep and the
            goats, and between the faithful and those who believe not.</p>
         <p>And he said to them: Because the gate of life is strait and the way of truth narrow,
            therefore are the believers of the truth few, and through unbelief is Satan’s
            gratification. Therefore are the liars many who lead astray those that see. For, were it
            not that there is a good end awaiting believing men, our Lord would not have descended
            from heaven, and come to be born, and to endure the suffering of death. Yet He did come,
            and us did He send<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/>…of the faith which we preach, that God was crucified for<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> all
            men.</p>
         <p>And, if there be those who are not willing<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> to agree with these our words, let them
            draw near to us and disclose to us what is in their mind, that, like as in the case of a
            disease, we may apply to their thoughts healing medicine for the cure of their ailments.
            For, though ye were not present at the time of <persName>Christ</persName>’s suffering, yet from the sun
            which was darkened, and which ye saw, learn ye and understand concerning the great
            convulsion<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> which took place at that time, when He was crucified whose Gospel has
            winged its way through all the earth by the signs which His disciples my fellows do in
            all the earth: yea, those who were Hebrews, and knew only the language of the Hebrews,
            in which they were born, lo! at this day are speaking in all languages, in order that
            those who are afar off may hear and believe, even as those who are near. For He it is
            that confounded the tongues of the presumptuous in this region who were before us; and
            He it is that teaches at this day the faith of truth and verity by us, humble and
            despicable<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> men from Galilee of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. For I also whom ye see am from <placeName>Paneas</placeName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/>
            from the place where the river <placeName>Jordan</placeName> issues forth, and I was chosen, together with my
            fellows, to be a preacher.</p>
         <p>For, according as my Lord commanded me, lo! I preach and publish the Gospel, and lo! His
            money do I cast upon the table before you, and the seed of His word do I sow in the ears
            of all men; and such as are willing to receive it, theirs is the good recompense of the
            confession of <persName>Christ</persName>; but those who are not persuaded, the dust of my feet do I shake
            off against them, as He commanded me.</p>
         <p>Repent therefore, my beloved, of evil ways and of abominable deeds, and turn yourselves
            towards Him with a good and honest will, as He hath turned Himself towards you with the
            favour of His rich mercies; and be ye not as the generations of former times that have
            passed away, which, because they hardened their heart against the fear of God, received
            punishment openly, that they themselves might be chastised, and that those who come
            after them may tremble and be afraid. For the purpose of our Lord’s coming into the
            world assuredly was,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> that He might teach us and show us that at the consummation of
            the creation there will be a resuscitation of all men, and that at that time their
            course of conduct will be portrayed in their persons, and their bodies will be volumes
            for the writings of justice; nor will any one be there who is unacquainted with books,
            because every one will read that which is written in His own book.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/></p>
         <p>Ye that have eyes, forasmuch as ye do not perceive, are yourselves also become like
            those who see not and hear not; and in vain do your ineffectual voices strain themselves
            to deaf<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> ears. Whilst they are not to be blamed for not hearing, because they are
            by<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> nature deaf and dumb, yet the blame which is justly incurred falls upon you,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/>
            because ye are not willing to perceive—not even that which ye see. For the dark cloud of
            error which overspreads your minds suffers you not to obtain the heavenly light, which
            is the understanding of knowledge.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/></p>
         <p>Flee, then, from things made and created, as I said to you, which are only called gods
            in name, whilst they are not gods in their nature; and draw near to this Being, who in
            His nature is God from everlasting and from eternity, and is not something made, like
            your idols, nor is He a creature and a work of art, like those images in which ye glory.
            Because, although this<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> Being put on a body, yet is He God with His Father. For the
            works of creation, which trembled when He was slain and were dismayed at His suffering
            of death,—these bear witness that He is Himself God the Creator. For it was not on
            account of a man that the earth trembled,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> but on account of Him who established the
            earth upon the waters; nor was it on account of a man that the sun grew dark in the
            heavens, but on account of Him who made the great lights; nor was it for a man that the
            just and righteous were restored to life again, but for Him who had granted power over
            death from the beginning; nor was it for a man that the veil of the temple of the <persName>Jews</persName>
            was rent from the top to the bottom, but for Him who said to them, <quote>Lo, your house is
            left desolate.</quote> For, lo! unless those who crucified Him had known that He was the Son of
            God, they would not have had to proclaim<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> the desolation<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> of their city, nor would
            they have brought down Woe! upon themselves.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> For, even if they had wished to make
            light of this confession,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> the fearful convulsions which took place at that time
            would not have suffered them to do so. For lo! some even of the children of the
            crucifiers are become at this day preachers and evangelists, along with my
            fellow-apostles, in all the land of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, and among the <persName>Samaritans</persName>, and in all the
            country of the <placeName>Philistines</placeName>. The idols also of paganism are despised, and the cross of
            <persName>Christ</persName> is honoured, and all nations and creatures confess God who became man.</p>
         <p>If, therefore, while <persName>Jesus</persName> our Lord was on earth ye would have believed in Him that He
            is the Son of God, and before ye had heard the word of His preaching would have
            confessed Him that He is God; now that He is ascended to His Father, and ye have seen
            the signs and the wonders which are done in His name, and have heard with your own ears
            the word of His Gospel, let no one of you doubt in his mind—so that the promise of His
            blessing which He sent to you may be fulfilled<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> towards you: Blessed are ye that have
            believed in me, not having seen me; and, because ye have so believed in me, the town<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/>
            in which ye dwell shall be blessed, and the enemy shall not prevail against it for
            ever.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> Turn not away, therefore, from his faith: for, lo! ye have heard and seen what
            things bear witness to His faith—showing that He is the adorable Son, and is the
            glorious God, and is the victorious King, and is the mighty Power; and through faith in
            Him a man is able to acquire the eyes of a true mind,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/> and to understand that,
            whosoever worshippeth creatures, the wrath of justice will overtake him.</p>
         <p>For in everything which we speak before you, according as we have received of the gift
            of our Lord, so speak we and teach and declare it, that ye may secure<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> your salvation
            and not destroy<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/> your spirits through the error of paganism: because the heavenly
            light has arisen on the creation, and He it is who chose the fathers of former times,
            and the righteous men, and the prophets, and spoke with them in the revelation of the
            Holy Spirit.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/> For He is Himself the God of the <persName>Jews</persName> who crucified Him; and to Him it
            is that the erring pagans offer worship, even while they know it not: because there is
            no other God in heaven and on earth; and lo! confession ascendeth up to Him from the
            four quarters of the creation. Lo! therefore, your ears have heard that which was not
            heard by you; and lo! further, your eyes have seen that which was never seen by
            you.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n36"/></p>
         <p>Be not, therefore, gainsayers of that which ye have seen and heard. Put away from you
            the rebellious mind of your fathers, and free yourselves from the yoke of sin, which
            hath dominion over you in libations and in sacrifices offered before carved images; and
            be ye concerned for your endangered<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/> salvation, and for the unavailing support on
            which ye lean;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n38"/> and get you a new mind, that worships the Maker and not the things
            which are made—a mind in which is portrayed the image of verity and of truth, of the
            Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; believing and being baptized in the
            triple and glorious names. For this is our teaching and our preaching. For the belief of
            the truth of <persName>Christ</persName> does not consist of many things.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39"/> And those of you as are willing
            to be obedient to <persName>Christ</persName> are aware that I have many times repeated my words before you,
            in order that ye might learn and understand what ye hear.</p>
         <p>And we ourselves shall rejoice in this, like the husbandman who rejoices in the field
            which is blessed; God also will be glorified by your repentance towards Him. While ye
            are saved hereby, we also, who give you this counsel, shall not be despoiled of the
            blessed reward of this work. And, because I am assured that ye are a land blessed
            according to the will of the Lord <persName>Christ</persName>, therefore, instead of the dust of our feet
            which we were commanded to shake off against the town that would not receive our words,
            I have shaken off to-day at the door of your ears the sayings of my lips, in which are
            portrayed the coming of <persName>Christ</persName> which has already been, and also that which is yet to be;
            and the resurrection, and the resuscitation of all men, and the separation which is to
            be made between the faithful and the unbelieving; and the sore punishment which is
            reserved for those who know not God, and the blessed promise of future joy which they
            shall receive who have believed in <persName>Christ</persName> and worshipped Him and His exalted Father, and
            have confessed Him and His divine Spirit.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40"/></p>
         <p>And now it is meet for us that I conclude my present discourse; and let those who have
            accepted the word of <persName>Christ</persName> remain with us, and those also who are willing to join with
            us in prayer; and afterwards let them go to their homes.</p>
         <p>And <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle was rejoiced to see that a great number of the population of the
            city stayed with him; and they were but few who did not remain at that time, while even
            those few not many days after accepted his words and believed in the Gospel set forth
            in<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41"/> the preaching of <persName>Christ</persName>.</p>
         <p>And when <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle had spoken these things before all the town of <placeName>Edessa</placeName>, and
            King <persName>Abgar</persName> saw that all the city rejoiced in his teaching, men and women alike, and
            heard them saying to him, “True and faithful is <persName>Christ</persName> who sent thee to us”—he himself
            also rejoiced greatly at this, giving praise to God; because, like as he had heard from
            <persName>Hanan</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42"/> his <persName>Tabularius</persName>, about <persName>Christ</persName>, so had he seen the wonderful mighty-works which
            <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle did in the name of <persName>Christ</persName>.</p>
         <p>And <persName>Abgar</persName> the king also said to him: According as I sent to <persName>Christ</persName> in my letter to Him,
            and according as He also sent to me, so have I also received from thine own self this
            day; so will I believe all the days of my life, and in the selfsame things will I
            continue and make my boast, because I know also that there is no other power in whose
            name these signs and wonders are done but the power of <persName>Christ</persName> whom thou preachest in
            verity and in truth. And henceforth Him will I worship—I and my son <persName>Maanu</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43"/> and
            <persName>Augustin</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44"/> and <persName>Shalmath</persName> the queen. And now, wherever thou desirest, build a church, a
            place of meeting for those who have believed and shall believe in thy words; and,
            according to the command given thee by thy Lord, minister thou at the seasons with
            confidence; to those also who shall be with thee as teachers of this Gospel I am
            prepared to give large donations, in order that they may not have any other work beside
            the ministry; and whatsoever is required by thee for the expenses of the building I
            myself will give thee without any restriction,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n45"/> whilst thy word shall be
            authoritative and sovereign in this town; moreover, without the intervention of any
            other person do thou come into my presence as one in authority, into the palace of my
            royal majesty.</p>
         <p>And when <persName>Abgar</persName> was gone down to his royal palace he rejoiced, he and his princes with
            him, <persName>Abdu</persName> son of <persName>Abdu</persName>, and <persName>Garmai</persName>, and <persName>Shemashgram</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n46"/> and <persName>Abubai</persName>, and <persName>Meherdath</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n47"/>
            together with the others their companions, at all that their eyes had seen and their
            ears also had heard; and in the gladness of their heart they too began to praise God for
            having turned their mind towards Him, renouncing the paganism in which they had
            lived,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48"/> and confessing the Gospel of <persName>Christ</persName>. And when <persName>Addaeus</persName> had built a church they
            proceeded to offer in it vows and oblations, they and the people of the city; and there
            they continued to present their praises all the days of their life.</p>
         <p>And <persName>Avida</persName> and <persName>Barcalba</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n49"/> who were chief men and rulers, and wore the royal
            headband,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n50"/> drew near to <persName>Addaeus</persName>, and asked him about the matter of <persName>Christ</persName>, requesting
            that he would tell them how He, though He was God, appeared to them as a man: And how,
            said they, were ye able to look upon Him? And he proceeded to satisfy them all about
            this, about all that their eyes had seen and about whatsoever their ears had heard from
            him. Moreover, everything that the prophets had spoken concerning Him he repeated before
            them, and they received his words gladly and with faith, and there was not a man that
            withstood him; for the glorious deeds which he did suffered not any man to withstand
            him.</p>
         <p><persName>Shavida</persName>, moreover, and <persName>Ebednebu</persName>, chiefs of the priests of this town, together with
            <persName>Piroz</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n51"/> and <persName>Dilsu</persName> their companions, when they had seen the signs which he did, ran and
            threw down the altars on which they were accustomed to sacrifice before <persName>Nebu</persName> and
            <persName>Bel</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n52"/> their gods, except the great altar which was in the middle of the town; and
            they cried out and said: Verily this is the disciple of that eminent and glorious
            Master, concerning whom we have heard all that He did in the country of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. And
            all those who believed in <persName>Christ</persName> did <persName>Addaeus</persName> receive, and baptized them in the name of
            the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. And those who used to worship stones
            and stocks sat at his feet, recovered from the madness<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n53"/> of paganism wherewith they
            had been afflicted. <persName>Jews</persName> also, traders in fine raiment,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n54"/> who were familiar with the
            law and the prophets—they too were persuaded, and became disciples, and confessed <persName>Christ</persName>
            that He is the Son of the living God.</p>
         <p>But neither did King <persName>Abgar</persName> nor yet the Apostle <persName>Addaeus</persName> compel any man by force to believe
            in <persName>Christ</persName>, because without the force of man the force of the signs compelled many to
            believe in Him. And with affection did they receive His doctrine—all this country of
            <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName>, and all the regions round about it.</p>
         <p><persName>Aggaeus</persName>, moreover, who<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55"/> made the silks<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56"/> and headbands of the king, and <persName>Palut</persName>, and
            Barshelama, and Barsamya, together with the others their companions, clave to <persName>Addaeus</persName> the
            apostle; and he received them, and associated them with him in the ministry, their
            business being to read in the Old Testament and the New,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n57"/> and in the prophets, and in
            the Acts of the Apostles, and to meditate upon them daily; strictly charging them to let
            their bodies be pure and their persons holy, as is becoming in men who stand before the
            altar of God. <quote>And be ye,</quote> said he, <quote>far removed from false swearing and from wicked
            homicide, and from dishonest testimony, which is connected with adultery; and from magic
            arts, for which there is no mercy, and from sooth-saying, and divination, and
            fortune-tellers; and from fate and nativities, of which the deluded Chaldeans make their
            boast; and from the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, in which the foolish put their
            trust. And put far from you unjust partiality, and bribes, and presents, through which
            the innocent are pronounced guilty. And along with this ministry, to which ye have been
            called, see that ye have no other work besides: for the Lord is the work of your
            ministry all the days of your life. And be ye diligent to give the seal of baptism. And
            be not fond of the gains of this world. And hear ye a cause with justice and with truth.
            And be ye not a stumbling-block to the blind, lest through you should be blasphemed the
            name of Him who opened the eyes of the blind, according as we have seen. Let all,
            therefore, who see you perceive that ye yourselves are in harmony with whatsoever ye
            preach and teach.</quote></p>
         <p>And they ministered with him in the church which <persName>Addaeus</persName> had built at the word and
            command of <persName>Abgar</persName> the king, being furnished with supplies by the king and his nobles,
            partly for the house of God, and partly for the supply of the poor. Moreover, much
            people day by day assembled and came to the prayers of the service, and to the reading
            of the Old Testament, and the New of the Diatessaron.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n58"/> They also believed in the
            restoration of the dead, and buried their departed in the hope of resuscitation. The
            festivals of the Church they also observed in their seasons, and were assiduous every
            day in the vigils of the Church. And they made visits of almsgiving, to the sick and to
            those that were whole, according to the instruction of <persName>Addaeus</persName> to them. In the environs,
            too, of the city churches were built, and many received from him ordination to the
            priesthood.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n59"/> So that even people of the East, in the guise of merchants, passed over
            into the territory of the Romans, that they might see the signs which <persName>Addaeus</persName> did. And
            such as became disciples received from him ordination to the priesthood, and in their
            own country of the Assyrians they instructed the people of their nation, and erected
            houses of prayer there in secret, by reason of the danger from those who worshipped fire
            and paid reverence to water.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n60"/></p>
         <p>Moreover, Narses, the king of the Assyrians, when he heard of those same things which
            <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle had done, sent a message to <persName>Abgar</persName> the king: Either despatch to me the
            man who doeth these signs before thee, that I may see him and hear his word, or send me
            an account of all that thou hast seen him do in thy own town. And <persName>Abgar</persName> wrote to
            Narses,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n61"/> and related to him the whole story of the deeds of <persName>Addaeus</persName> from the beginning
            to the end; and he left nothing which he did not write to him. And, when Narses heard
            those things which were written to him, he was astonished and amazed.</p>
         <p><persName>Abgar</persName> the king, moreover, because he was not able to pass over into the territory of the
            Romans,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n62"/> and go to <placeName>Palestine</placeName> and slay the <persName>Jews</persName> for having crucified <persName>Christ</persName>, wrote a
            letter and sent it to <persName>Tiberius Caesar</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n63"/> writing in it thus:—</p>
         <p>King <persName>Abgar</persName> to our Lord <persName>Tiberius Caesar</persName>: Although I know that nothing is hidden from thy
            Majesty, I write to inform thy dread and mighty Sovereignty that the <persName>Jews</persName> who are under
            thy dominion and dwell in the country of <placeName>Palestine</placeName> have assembled themselves together
            and crucified <persName>Christ</persName>, without any fault worthy of death, after He had done before them
            signs and wonders, and had shown them powerful mighty-works, so that He even raised the
            dead to life for them; and at the time that they crucified Him the sun became darkened
            and the earth also quaked, and all created things trembled and quaked, and, as if of
            themselves, at this deed the whole creation and the inhabitants of the creation shrank
            away. And now thy Majesty knoweth what it is meet for thee to command concerning the
            people of the <persName>Jews</persName> who have done these things.</p>
         <p>And <persName>Tiberius Caesar</persName> wrote and sent to King <persName>Abgar</persName>; and thus did he write to him:—</p>
         <p>The letter of thy Fidelity towards me I have received, and it hath been read before me.
            Concerning what the <persName>Jews</persName> have dared to do in the matter of the cross, <persName>Pilate</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n64"/> the
            governor also has written and informed <persName>Aulbinus</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n65"/> my proconsul concerning these
            selfsame things of which thou hast written to me. But, because a war with the people of
            <placeName>Spain</placeName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n66"/> who have rebelled against me, is on foot at this time, on this account I have
            not been able to avenge this matter; but I am prepared, when I shall have leisure, to
            issue a command according to law against the <persName>Jews</persName>, who act not according to law. And on
            this account, as regards <persName>Pilate</persName> also, who was appointed by me governor there—I have sent
            another in his stead, and dismissed him in disgrace, because he departed from the
            law,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n67"/> and did the will of the <persName>Jews</persName>, and for the gratification of the <persName>Jews</persName> crucified
            <persName>Christ</persName>, who, according to what I hear concerning Him, instead of suffering the cross of
            death, deserved to be honoured and worshipped<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n68"/> by them: and more especially because
            with their own eyes they saw everything that He did. Yet thou, in accordance with thy
            fidelity towards me, and the faithful covenant entered into by thyself and by thy
            fathers, hast done well in writing to me thus.</p>
         <p>And <persName>Abgar</persName> the king received <persName>Aristides</persName>, who had been sent by <persName>Tiberius Caesar</persName> to him; and
            in reply he sent him back with presents of honour suitable for him who had sent him to
            him. And from <placeName>Edessa</placeName> he went to Thicuntha,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n69"/> where <persName>Claudius</persName>, the second from the
            emperor, was; and from thence, again, he went to Artica,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n70"/> where <persName>Tiberius Caesar</persName> was:
            <persName>Caius</persName>, moreover, was guarding the regions round about <persName>Caesar</persName>. And <persName>Aristides</persName> himself also
            related before <persName>Tiberius</persName> concerning the mighty-works which <persName>Addaeus</persName> had done before <persName>Abgar</persName>
            the king. And when he had leisure from the war he sent and put to death some of the
            chief men of the <persName>Jews</persName> who were in <placeName>Palestine</placeName>. And, when <persName>Abgar</persName> the king heard of this, he
            rejoiced greatly that the <persName>Jews</persName> had received punishment, as it was right.</p>
         <p>And some years after <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle had built the church in <placeName>Edessa</placeName>, and had
            furnished it with everything that was suitable for it, and had made disciples of a great
            number of the population of the city, he further built churches in the villages<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71"/>
            also—both those which were at a distance and those which were near, and finished and
            adorned them, and appointed in them deacons and elders, and instructed in them those who
            should read the Scriptures, and taught the ordinances and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n72"/> the ministry without and
            within.</p>
         <p>After all these things he fell ill of the sickness of which he departed from this world.
            And he called for <persName>Aggaeus</persName> before the whole assembly of the church, and bade him draw
            near, and made him Guide and Ruler<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73"/> in his stead. And <persName>Palut</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n74"/> who was a deacon, he
            made elder; and <persName>Abshelama</persName>, who was a scribe, he made deacon. And, the nobles and chief
            men being assembled, and standing near him—<persName>Barcalba</persName> son of <persName>Zati</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n75"/> and <persName>Maryhab</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n76"/> son
            of <persName>Barshemash</persName>, and <persName>Senac</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n77"/> son of <persName>Avida</persName>, and <persName>Piroz</persName> son of Patric,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78"/> together with
            the rest of their companions—<persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle said to them:—</p>
         <p><quote>Ye know and are witness, all of you who hear me, that, according to all that I have
            preached to you and taught you and ye have heard from me, even so have I behaved myself
            in the midst of you, and ye have seen it in deeds also: because our Lord thus charged
            us, that, whatsoever we preach in words before the people, we should practise it in
            deeds before all men. And, according to the ordinances and laws which were appointed by
            the disciples in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n79"/> and by which my fellow-apostles also guided their
            conduct, so also do ye—turn not aside from them, nor diminish aught from them: even as I
            also am guided by them amongst you, and have not turned aside from them to the right
            hand or to the left, lest I should become estranged from the promised salvation which is
            reserved for such as are guided by them.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Give<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n80"/> heed, therefore, to this ministry which ye hold, and with fear and trembling
            continue in it, and minister every day. Minister not in it with neglectful habits, but
            with the discreetness of faith; and let not the praises of <persName>Christ</persName> cease out of your
            mouth, nor let weariness of prayer at the stated times come upon you. Give heed to the
            verity which ye hold, and to the teaching of the truth which ye have received, and to
            the inheritance of salvation which I commit to you: because before the tribunal of
            <persName>Christ</persName> will ye have to give an account of it, when He maketh reckoning with the
            shepherds and overseers, and when He taketh His money from the traders with the addition
            of the gains. For He is the Son of a King, and goeth to receive a kingdom and return;
            and He will come and make a resuscitation to life for all men, and then will He sit upon
            the throne of His righteousness, and judge the dead and the living, as He said to
            us.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Let not the secret eye of your minds be closed by pride, lest your stumbling-blocks be
            many in the way in which there are no stumbling-blocks, but a hateful<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n81"/> wandering in
            its paths. Seek ye those that are lost, and direct those that go astray, and rejoice in
            those that are found; bind up the bruised, and watch over the fatlings: because at your
            hands will the sheep of <persName>Christ</persName> be required. Look ye not for the honour that passeth
            away: for the shepherd that looketh to receive honour from his flock—sadly, sadly stands
            his flock with respect to him. Let your concern be great for the young lambs, whose
            angels behold the face of the Father who is unseen. And be ye not stones of stumbling
            before the blind, but clearers of the way and the paths in a rugged country, among the
            <persName>Jews</persName> the crucifiers, and the deluded pagans: for with these two parties have ye to
            fight, in order that ye may show the truth of the faith which ye hold; and, though ye be
            silent, your modest and decorous appearance will fight for you against those who hate
            truth and love falsehood.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Buffet not the poor in the presence of the rich: for scourge grievous enough for them
            is their poverty.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Be not beguiled by the hateful devices of Satan, lest ye be stripped naked of the faith
            which ye have put on.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n82"/>…<quote>And with the <persName>Jews</persName>, the crucifiers, we will have no
            fellowship. And this inheritance which we have received from thee we will not let go,
            but in that will we depart out of this world; and on the day of our Lord, before the
            judgment-seat of His righteousness, there will He restore to us this inheritance, even
            as thou hast told us.</quote></p>
         <p>And, when these things had been spoken, <persName>Abgar</persName> the king rose up, he and his chief men and
            his nobles, and he went to his palace, all of them being distressed for him because he
            was dying. And he sent to him noble and excellent apparel, that he might be buried in
            it. And, when <persName>Addaeus</persName> saw it, he sent to him, saying: In my lifetime I have not taken
            anything from thee, nor will I now at my death take anything from thee, nor will I
            frustrate the word of <persName>Christ</persName> which He spake to us: Accept not anything from any man, and
            possess not anything in this world.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83"/></p>
         <p>And three days more after these things had been spoken by <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle, and he had
            heard and received the testimony concerning the teaching set forth in their preaching
            from those engaged with him in the ministry, in the presence of all the nobles he
            departed out of this world. And that day was the fifth of the week, and the fourteenth
            of the month Iyar,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84"/> nearly answering to May. And the whole city was in great mourning
            and bitter anguish for him. Nor was it the Christians only that were distressed for him,
            but the <persName>Jews</persName> also, and the pagans, who were in this same town. But <persName>Abgar</persName> the king was
            distressed for him more than any one, he and the princes of his kingdom. And in the
            sadness of his soul he despised and laid aside the magnificence of his kingly state on
            that day, and with tears mingled with moans he bewailed him with all men. And all the
            people of the city that saw him were amazed to see how greatly he suffered on his
            account. And with great and surpassing pomp he bore him, and buried him like one of the
            princes when he dies; and he laid him in a grand sepulchre adorned with sculpture
            wrought by the fingers—that in which were laid those of the house of <placeName>Ariu</placeName>, the ancestors
            of <persName>Abgar</persName> the king: there he laid him sorrowfully, with sadness and great distress. And
            all the people of the church went there from time to time and prayed fervently; and they
            kept up the remembrance of his departure from year to year, according to the command and
            direction which had been received by them from <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85"/> and according to
            the word of <persName>Aggaeus</persName>, who himself became Guide and Ruler, and the successor of his seat
            after him, by the ordination to the priesthood which he had received from him in the
            presence of all men.</p>
         <p>He too, with the same ordination which he had received from him, made Priests and Guides
            in the whole of this country of <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName>. For they also, in like manner as <persName>Addaeus</persName> the
            apostle, held fast his word, and listened to and received it, as good and faithful
            successors of the apostle of the adorable <persName>Christ</persName>. But silver and gold he took not from
            any man, nor did the gifts of the princes come near him: for, instead of receiving gold
            and silver, he himself enriched the Church of <persName>Christ</persName> with the souls of believers.</p>
         <p>Moreover, as regards the entire state<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86"/> of the men and the women, they were chaste and
            circumspect, and holy and pure: for they lived like anchorites<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87"/> and chastely, without
            spot—in circumspect watchfulness touching the ministry, in their sympathy<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88"/> toward the
            poor, in their visitations to the sick: for their footsteps were fraught with praise
            from those who saw them, and their conduct was arrayed in commendation from strangers—so
            that even the priests of the house of<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89"/> <persName>Nebu</persName> and <persName>Bel</persName> divided the honour with them at
            all times, by reason of their dignified aspect, their truthful words, their frankness of
            speech arising from their noble nature, which was neither subservient through
            covetousness nor in bondage under the fear of blame. For there was no one who saw them
            that did not run to meet them, that he might salute them respectfully, because the very
            sight of them shed peace upon the beholden: for just like a net<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90"/> were their words of
            gentleness spread over the contumacious, and they entered within the fold of truth and
            verity. For there was no man who saw them that was ashamed of them, because they did
            nothing that was not accordant with rectitude and propriety. And in consequence of these
            things their bearing was fearless as they published their teaching to all men. For,
            whatsoever they said to others and enjoined on them, they themselves exhibited in
            practice in their own persons; and the hearers, who saw that their actions went along
            with their words, without much persuasion became their disciples, and confessed the King
            <persName>Christ</persName>, praising God for having turned them towards Him.</p>
         <p>And some years after the death of <persName>Abgar</persName> the king, there arose one of his
            contumacious<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91"/> sons, who was not favourable to peace; and he sent word to <persName>Aggaeus</persName>, as
            he was sitting in the church: Make me a headband of gold, such as thou usedst to make
            for my fathers in former times. <persName>Aggaeus</persName> sent to him: I will not give up the ministry of
            <persName>Christ</persName>, which was committed to me by the disciple of <persName>Christ</persName>, and make a headband of
            wickedness. And, when he saw that he did not comply, he sent and brake his legs<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n92"/> as
            he was sitting in the church expounding. And as he was dying he adjured <persName>Palut</persName> and
            <persName>Abshelama</persName>: In this house, for whose truth’s sake, lo! I am dying, lay me and bury me.
            And, even as he had adjured them, so did they lay him—inside the middle door of the
            church, between the men and the women. And there was great and bitter mourning in all
            the church, and in all the city—over and above the anguish and the mourning which there
            had been within the church, such as had been the mourning when <persName>Addaeus</persName> the apostle
            himself died.</p>
         <p>And,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n93"/> in consequence of his dying suddenly and quickly at the breaking of his legs,

            who reigned there thirteen years.</p>
         <p>And, according to the custom which exists in the kingdom of <persName>Abgar</persName> the king, and in all
            kingdoms, that whatsoever the king commands and whatsoever is spoken in his presence is

            the kings, where the ordinances and laws are deposited, and where the contracts of the

               Testament. This notion of the immunity of the city of Edessa is referred to by
               several Syriac writers. Nor was it confined to the East: it obtained in very early
               times in our own country, where the letter of our Lord to Abgar was regarded as a
               charm. In a very ancient service-book of the Saxon times, preserved in the British
               Museum, the letter followed the Lord’s Prayer and the Apostles’ Creed; and an
               appended description of the virtues of the epistle closes with these words, according
               to the Latin version of Rufinus: <quote><foreign xml:lang="ln">Si quis hanc epistolam secum habuerit, securus
               ambulet in pace.</foreign></quote> Jeremiah Jones, writing of the last century, says: <quote>The common
               people in England have had it in their houses in many places in a frame with a
               picture before it: and they generally, with much honesty and devotion, regard it as
               the word of God and the genuine epistle of Christ.</quote> Even now a similar practice is
               believed to linger in some districts. The story of Abgar is told in an Anglo-Saxon
               poem, published in Abgarus-Legenden paa Old-Engelsk by G. Stephens, Copenhagen, 1853.
               It consists of 204 lines, is a tolerable close rendering of Eusebius, and is ascribed
               by Stephens to Aelfric, archbishop of York from 1023 to 1052. Note that ambulet

               into Syriac.</note>
            <note xml:id="n67">Baronius says Pilate violated the law by crucifying our Lord so soon

            <note xml:id="n68">Tiberius is said by Tertullian (Apol., 5) to have referred to the
               senate the question of admitting Christ among the gods. This has been interpolated
               into the epistle of Tiberius to Abgar as given in Moses Chor., B. ii. c. 33. He also
               adds another letter from Abgar in reply to this.</note>

            <note xml:id="n73">It is plain from the context here, as well as wherever it occurs in

               the East. The first mention we find of the title Bishop (in these pages) is in the
               Acts of Sharbil about a.d. 105–112, where Barsamya is called <quote>the Bishop of the
               Christians,</quote> although he is more generally designated as here. It is also found in
               the Teaching Simon Cephas, sub fin., which seems to have been written early in the
               second century or at the end of the first. The passage in the Teaching of Addaeus, p.
               665, infra, where it occurs, was interpolated at a much later period. [The

               him.</note>

               the time that Aggaeus was appointed Bishop, or Guide and Ruler. This took place even
               before the death of Abgar, who died a.d. 45; whereas Serapion did not become bishop
               of Antioch till the beginning of the third century, if, as is here stated, he was
               consecrated by Zephyrinus, who did not become Bishop of Rome till a.d. 201.</note>
