         <p><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/>The Teaching of Simon Cephas<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> in the City of Rome.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/></p>
         <p>In the third<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> year of Claudius Caesar, Simon Cephas departed from Antioch to go to
            Rome. And as he passed on he preached in the divers countries the word of our Lord. And,
            when he had nearly arrived there,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> many had heard of it and went out to meet him, and
            the whole church received him with great joy. And some of the princes of the city,
            wearers of the imperial headbands,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> came to him, that they might see him and hear his
            word. And, when the whole city was gathered together about him, he stood up to speak to
            them, and to show them the preaching of his doctrine, of what sort it was. And he began
            to speak to them thus:—</p>
         <p>Men, people of Rome, saints of all Italy, hear ye that which I say to you. This day I
            preach and proclaim Jesus the Son of God, who came down from heaven, and became man, and
            was with us as one of ourselves, and wrought marvellous mighty-works and signs and
            wonders before us, and before all the Jews that are in the land of Palestine. And you
            yourselves also heard of those things which He did: because they came to Him from other
            countries also, on account of the fame of His healing and the report of the marvellous
            help He gave;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> and whosoever drew near to Him was healed by His word. And, inasmuch as
            He was God, at the same time that He healed He also forgave sins: for His healing, which
            was open to view, bore witness of His hidden forgiveness, that it was real and
            trustworthy. For this Jesus did the prophets announce in their mysterious sayings, as
            they were looking forward to see Him and to hear His word: Him who was with His Father
            from eternity and from everlasting; God, who was hidden in the height, and appeared in
            the depth; the glorious Son, who was from His Progenitor, and is to be glorified,
            together with His Father, and His divine Spirit, and the terrible power of His dominion.
            And He was crucified of His own will by the hands of sinners, and was taken up to His
            Father, even as I and my companions saw. And He is about to come again, in His own glory
            and that of His holy angels, even as we heard Him say to us. For we cannot say anything
            which was not heard by us from Him, neither do we write in the book of His Gospel
            anything which He Himself did not say to us: because this word is spoken in order that
            the mouth of liars may be shut, in the day when men shall give an account of idle words
            at the place of judgment.</p>
         <p>Moreover, because we were catchers of fish,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> and not skilled in books, therefore did
            He also say to us: “I will send you the Spirit, the Paraclete, that He may teach you
            that which ye know not;” for it is by His gift that we speak those things which ye hear.
            And, further, by it we bring aid to the sick, and healing to the diseased: that by the
            hearing of His word and by the aid of His power ye may believe in Christ, that He is
            God, the Son of God; and may be delivered from the service of bondage, and may worship
            Him and His Father, and glorify His divine Spirit. For when we glorify the Father, we
            glorify the Son also with Him; and when we worship the Son, we worship the Father also
            with Him; and when we confess the Spirit, we confess the Father also and the Son:
            because in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit, were we commanded
            to baptize those who believe, that they may live for ever.</p>
         <p>Flee therefore from the words of the wisdom of this world, in which there is no profit,
            and draw near to those which are true and faithful, and acceptable before God; whose
            reward also is laid up in store, and whose recompense standeth sure. Now, too,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> the
            light has arisen on the creation, and the world has obtained the eyes of the mind, that
            every man may see and understand that it is not fit that creatures should be worshipped
            instead of the Creator, nor together with the Creator: because everything which is a
            creature is made to be a worshipper of its Maker, and is not to be worshipped like its
            Creator. But this One who came to us is God, the Son of God, in His own nature,
            notwithstanding that He mingled<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> His Godhead with our manhood, in order that He might
            renew our manhood by the aid of His Godhead. And on this account it is right that we
            should worship Him, because He is to be worshipped together with His Father, and that we
            should not worship creatures, who were created for the worship of the Creator. For He is
            Himself the God of truth and verity; He is Himself from before all worlds and creatures;
            He is Himself the veritable Son, and the glorious fruit<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> which is from the exalted
            Father.</p>
         <p>But ye see the wonderful works which accompany and follow these words. One would not
            credit it: the time lo! is short since He ascended to His Father, and see how His Gospel
            has winged its flight through the whole creation—that thereby it may be known and
            believed that He Himself is the Creator of creatures, and that by His bidding creatures
            subsist. And, whereas ye saw the sun become darkened at His death, ye yourselves also
            are witnesses. The earth, moreover, quaked when He was slain, and the veil was rent at
            His death. And concerning these things the governor Pilate also was witness: for he
            himself sent and made them known to Caesar,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> and these things, and more than these,
            were read before him, and before the princes of your city. And on this account Caesar was
            angry against Pilate because he had unjustly listened to the persuasion of the Jews; and
            for this reason he sent and took away from him the authority which he had given to him.
            And this same thing was published and known in all the dominion of the Romans. That,
            therefore, which Pilate saw and made known to Caesar and to your honourable senate, the
            same do I preach and declare, as do also my fellow-apostles. And ye know that Pilate
            could not have written to the imperial government of that which did not take place and
            which he had not seen with his own eyes; but that which did take place and was actually
            done—this it was that he wrote and made known. Moreover, the watchers of the sepulchre
            also were witnesses of those things which took place there: they became as dead men;
            and, when those watchers were questioned before Pilate, they confessed before him how
            large a bribe the chief-priests of the Jews had given them, so that they might say that
            we His disciples had stolen the corpse of Christ. Lo! then, ye have heard many things;
            and moreover, if ye be not willing to be persuaded by those things which ye have heard,
            be at least persuaded by the mighty-works which ye see, which are done by His name.</p>
         <p>Let not Simon the sorcerer delude you by semblances which are not realities, which he
            exhibits to you, as to men who have no understanding, who know not how to discern that
            which they see and hear. Send, therefore, and fetch him to where all your city is
            assembled together, and choose you some sign for us to do before you; and, whichever ye
            see do that same sign, it will be your part to believe in it.</p>
         <p>And immediately they sent and fetched Simon the sorcerer;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> and the men who were
            adherents of his opinion said to him: As a man concerning whom we have confidence that
            there is power in thee to do anything whatsoever,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> do thou some sign before us all,
            and let this Simon the Galilaean, who preaches Christ, see it. And, whilst they were thus
            speaking to him, there happened to be passing along a dead person, a son of one of those
            who were chiefs and men of note and renown among them. And all of them, as they were
            assembled together, said to him: Whichever of you shall restore to life this dead
            person, he is true, and to be believed in and received, and we will all follow him in
            whatsoever he saith to us. And they said to Simon the sorcerer: Because thou wast here
            before Simon the Galilaean, and we knew thee before him, exhibit thou first the power
            which accompanieth thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/></p>
         <p>Then Simon reluctantly drew near to the dead person; and they set down the bier before
            him; and he looked to the right hand and to the left, and gazed up into heaven, saying
            many words: some of them he uttered aloud, and some of them secretly and not aloud. And
            he delayed a long while, and nothing took place, and nothing was done, and the dead
            person was lying upon his bier.</p>
         <p>And forthwith Simon Cephas drew near boldly towards the dead man, and cried aloud before
            all the assembly which was standing there: In the name of Jesus Christ, whom the Jews
            crucified at Jerusalem, and whom we preach, rise up thence. And as soon as the word of
            Simon was spoken the dead man came to life and rose up from the bier.</p>
         <p>And all the people saw and marvelled; and they said to Simon: Christ, whom thou
            preachest, is true. And many cried out, and said: Let Simon the sorcerer and the
            deceiver of us all be stoned. But Simon, by reason that every one was running to see the
            dead man that was come to life, escaped from them from one street to another and from
            house to house, and fell not into their hands on that day.</p>
         <p>But the whole city took hold of Simon Cephas, and they received him gladly and
            affectionately; and he ceased not from doing signs and wonders in the name of Christ;
            and many believed in him. Cuprinus,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> moreover, the father of him that was restored to
            life, took Simon with him to his house, and entertained him in a suitable manner, while
            he and all his household believed in Christ, that He is the Son of the living God. And
            many of the Jews and of the pagans became disciples there. And, when there was great
            rejoicing at his teaching, he built churches there, in Rome and in the cities round
            about, and in all the villages of the people of Italy; and he served there in the rank
            of the Superintendence of Rulers twenty-five years.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/></p>
         <p>And after these years Nero Caesar seized him and shut him up in prison. And he knew that
            he would crucify him; so he called Ansus,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> the deacon, and made him bishop in his
            stead in Rome. And these things did Simon himself speak; and moreover also the rest, the
            other things which he had in charge, he commanded Ansus to teach before the people,
            saying to him: Beside the New Testament and the Old let there not be read before the
            people<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> anything else:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> which is not right.</p>
         <p>And, when Caesar had commanded that Simon should be crucified with his head downwards, as
            he himself had requested of Caesar, and that Paul’s head should be taken off, there was
            great commotion among the people, and bitter distress in all the church, seeing that
            they were deprived of the sight of the apostles. And Isus the guide arose and took up
            their bodies by night, and buried them with great honour, and there came to be a
            gathering-place there for many.</p>
         <p>And at that very time, as if by a righteous judgment, Nero abandoned his empire and
            fled, and there was a cessation for a little while from the persecution which Nero Caesar
            had raised against them. And many years after the great coronation<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> of the apostles,
            who had departed out of the world, while ordination to the priesthood was proceeding
            both in all Rome and in all Italy, it happened then that there was a great famine in the
            city of Rome.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/></p>
         <p>Here endeth the teaching of Simon Cephas.</p>
         <noteGrp>
            <note xml:id="n">This is found in the same ms. as the preceding, quoted as A. There is
               also another copy of it in Cod. Add. 14,609, referred to here as B. [It looks like an
               afterthought of a later age, when the teaching of Peter was elevated into a
               specialty.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">B. reads “the Apostle Peter.”</note>
            <note xml:id="n">[This apocryphal history proceeds on the theory that St. Peter preceded
               St. Paul at Rome, which cannot be reconciled with Scripture and chronology. Gal. ii.
               9; Rom. i. 5–15.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">The reading of the ms. is “thirtieth.”</note>
            <note xml:id="n">From this place to “the light” (last line of text on this page), A. is
               lost, and the text has been supplied from B.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">The ms. gives, “clad in the white.”</note>
            <note xml:id="n">Lit. “His marvellous helps.”—Tr. [See p. 652, supra.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">[Mark i. 16–17. Compare Jer. xvi. 16.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">The text A. is resumed after this word. The reading “and now that the
               light,” etc., seems faulty. The *** (that) might easily have been occasioned by the
               *** of the word which it precedes.—Tr.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">The word so rendered is much effaced in B., but it seems to be ***,
               “humbled.” This, however, might require further change of the text, such as Cureton
               suggests, so as to give the sense, “He humbled His Godhead on account of our
               manhood,” unless we translated “in our manhood”—neither of which renderings seems to
               give so good a sense as that in the text of A.—Tr. Respecting the word “mingled”
               (***), which was supposed to countenance the Eutychian heresy, see Assemani, Bibl.
               Orient., vol. i. p. 81.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">Or “offspring.”—Tr.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">[On the Acts of Pilate see Lardner, Credib., vi. p. 605, and Jones, On
               the Canon, vol. ii. p. 342. If Leucius Charinus forged what goes by the name, it does
               not prove that genuine records of the kind never existed. The reverse is probable.
               See vol. i. p. 179.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">[Vol. vii. p. 453. Compare vol. vi. p. 438, note 15; also vol. i. p.
               171. On Justin’s simple narrative all the rest was embroidered by a later
               hand.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">From this place to “a gathering-place,” p. 675, line 20, col. 2, the
               text of A. is lost.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">[St. Peter’s visit could not have been previous to St. Paul’s, and up
               to that time Simon had certainly not corrupted the Romans (Rom. i. 8). The subject
               may be elucidated by what follows, infra.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">Perhaps Cyprianus, which is found written in Syriac in the same manner
               as the word here.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">This is the time often allotted to Peter’s episcopate at Rome, although
               it is certain that he did not constantly reside there during that period: we find him
               the year after at Jerusalem. [The chronological incredibility of this residence in
               Rome has been fully demonstrated; but it is so entirely inconsistent with the
               scriptural history, and with that of St. Paul in particular, that no other argument
               is necessary. On the other hand, it appears to me conclusively established, that St.
               Peter closed his life in Rome, under Nero. And I think this apostle’s visit fully
               explained by the fact that the Roman Christians were so largely “of the
               circumcision,” that St. Paul himself might naturally have invited him to share his
               own labours in Rome, on the well-known rule of his conduct (Rom. xv. 20; 2 Cor. x.
               13–16). See vol. vi. elucid. p. 47.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">B. has Lainus = Linus, the person undoubtedly meant. The error arose
               chiefly from the *** [L] being taken as the sign of the accusative case. Below, the
               name appears as Isus, and in the Acts of Barsamya we have Anus. This sign of the
               accusative may be omitted.—Tr.</note>
            <note xml:id="n">In canon x. (see next note) it is said “in the pulpit of the church;”
               and in the Teaching of Addaeus it is said that “a large multitude of the people
               assembled for the reading of the Old Testament and the New.” The inhibition seems,
               therefore, to refer only to public reading. [See p. 661, supra.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">This agrees with the tenth canon in the Teaching of the Apostles. [See
               p. 668, supra.]</note>
            <note xml:id="n">That is, their martyrdom. But B. reads “labour.”</note>
            <note xml:id="n">This abrupt termination seems to indicate that there was something more
               which followed. The famine referred to seems to be the same as that mentioned in the
               interpolated passage at the end of the Acts of Sharbil.</note>
