         <p>The Teaching of the Apostles.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></p>
         <p>At that time Christ was taken up to His Father; and how the apostles received the gift
            of the Spirit; and the Ordinances and Laws of the Church; and whither each one of the
            apostles went; and from whence the countries in the territory of the Romans received the
            ordination to the priesthood.</p>
         <p>In the year three hundred and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> thirty-nine of the kingdom of the Greeks, in the month
            Heziran,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> on the fourth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> day of the same, which is the first day of the week, and
            the end of Pentecost<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/>—on the selfsame day came the disciples from Nazareth of Galilee,
            where the conception of our Lord was announced, to the mount which is called that of the
            Place of Olives,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> our Lord being with them, but not being visible to them. And at the
            time of early dawn our Lord lifted up His hands, and laid them upon the heads of the
            eleven disciples, and gave to them the gift of the priesthood. And suddenly a bright
            cloud received Him. And they saw Him as He was going up to heaven. And He sat down on
            the right hand of His Father. And they praised God because they saw His ascension
            according as He had told them; and they rejoiced because they had received the Right
            Hand conferring on them the priesthood of the house of Moses and Aaron.</p>
         <p>And from thence they went up to the city, and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> proceeded to an upper room—that in
            which our Lord had observed the passover with them, and the place where the inquiries
            had been made: Who it was that should betray our Lord to the crucifiers? There also were
            made the inquiries:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> How they should preach His Gospel in the world? And, as within
            the upper room the mystery of the body and of the blood of our Lord began to prevail in
            the world, so also from thence did the teaching of His preaching begin to have authority
            in the world.</p>
         <p>And, when the disciples were cast into this perplexity, how they should preach His
            Gospel to men of strange tongues<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> which were unknown to them, and were speaking thus
            to one another: Although we are confident that Christ will perform by our hands mighty
            works and miracles in the presence of strange peoples whose tongues we know not, and who
            themselves also are unversed in our tongue, yet who shall teach them and make them
            understand that it is by the name of Christ who was crucified that these mighty works
            and miracles are done?—while, I say, the disciples were occupied with these thoughts,
            Simon Cephas rose up, and said to them: My brethren, this matter, how we shall preach
            His Gospel, pertaineth not to us, but to our Lord; for He knoweth how it is possible for
            us to preach His Gospel in the world; and we rely on His care for us, which He promised
            us, saying: “When I am ascended to my Father I will send you the Spirit, the Paraclete,
            that He may teach you everything which it is meet for you to know, and to make
            known.”</p>
         <p>And, whilst Simon Cephas was saying these things to his fellow-apostles, and putting
            them in remembrance, a mysterious voice was heard by them, and a sweet odour, which was
            strange to the world, breathed upon them;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> and tongues of fire, between the voice and
            the odour, came down from heaven<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> towards them, and alighted and sat on every one of
            them; and, according to the tongue which every one of them had severally received, so
            did he prepare himself to go to the country in which that tongue was spoken and
            heard.</p>
         <p>And, by the same gift of the Spirit which was given to them on that day, they appointed
            Ordinances and Laws—such as were in accordance with the Gospel of their preaching, and
            with the true and faithful doctrine of their teaching:—</p>
         <p>1. The apostles therefore appointed: Pray ye towards the east:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> because, “as the
            lightning which lighteneth from the east and is seen even to the west, so shall the
            coming of the Son of man be:”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> that by this we might know and understand that He will
            appear from the east suddenly.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/></p>
         <p>2. The apostles further appointed: On the first day of the week let there be service,
            and the reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the oblation:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> because on the first day
            of the week our Lord rose from the place of the dead and on the first day of the week He
            arose upon the world, and on the first day of the week He ascended up to heaven, and on
            the first day of the week He will appear at last with the angels of heaven.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/></p>
         <p>3. The apostles further appointed: On the fourth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> day of the week let there be
            service: because on that day our Lord made the disclosure to them about His trial,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/>
            and His suffering, and His crucifixion, and His death, and His resurrection; and the
            disciples were on account of this in sorrow.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/></p>
         <p>4. The apostles further appointed: On the eve of the Sabbath,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> at the ninth hour, let
            there be service: because that which had been spoken on the fourth day of the week about
            the suffering of the Saviour was brought to pass on the same eve; the worlds and
            creatures trembling, and the luminaries in the heavens being darkened.</p>
         <p>5. The apostles further appointed: Let there be elders and deacons, like the
            Levites;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> and subdeacons,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/> like those who carried the vessels of the court of the
            sanctuary of the Lord; and an overseer,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> who shall likewise be the Guide of all the
            people,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> like Aaron, the head and chief of all the priests and Levites of the whole
            city.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/></p>
         <p>6. The apostles further appointed: Celebrate the day of the Epiphany<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> of our Saviour,
            which is the chief of the festivals of the Church, on the sixth day of the latter
            Canun,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> in the long number of the Greeks.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/></p>
         <p>7. The apostles further appointed: Forty<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> days before the day of the passion of our
            Saviour fast ye, and then celebrate the day of the passion, and the day of the
            resurrection: because our Lord Himself also, the Lord of the festival, fasted forty
            days; and Moses and Elijah, who were endued with this mystery, likewise each fasted
            forty days, and then were glorified.</p>
         <p>8. The apostles further appointed: At the conclusion of all the Scriptures other let the
            Gospel be read, as being the seal<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/> of all the Scriptures; and let the people listen
            to it standing upon their feet: because it is the Gospel of the redemption of all
            men.</p>
         <p>9. The apostles further appointed: At the completion of fifty<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> days after His
            resurrection make ye a commemoration of His ascension to His glorious Father.</p>
         <p>10. The apostles appointed: That, beside the Old Testament, and the Prophets, and the
            Gospel, and the Acts (of their exploits), nothing should be read on the pulpit in the
            church.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/></p>
         <p>11. The apostles further appointed: Whosoever is unacquainted with the faith of the
            Church and the ordinances and laws which are appointed in it, let him not be a guide and
            ruler; and whosoever is acquainted with them and departs from them, let him not minister
            again: because, not being true in his ministry, he has lied.</p>
         <p>12. The apostles further appointed: Whosoever sweareth, or<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> lieth, or beareth false
            witness, or hath recourse to magicians and soothsayers and Chaldeans, and putteth
            confidence in fates and nativities, which they hold fast who know not God,—let him also,
            as a man that knoweth not God, be dismissed from the ministry, and not minister
            again.</p>
         <p>13. The apostles further appointed: If there be any man that is divided in mind touching
            the ministry, and who follows it not with a steadfast will<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/>, let not this man
            minister again: because the Lord of the ministry is not served by him with a stedfast
            will; and he deceiveth man only, and not God, “before whom crafty devices avail
            not.”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/></p>
         <p>14. The apostles further appointed: Whosoever lendeth and receiveth usury,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n36"/> and is
            occupied in merchandise and covetousness, let not this man minister again, nor continue
            in the ministry.</p>
         <p>15. The apostles further appointed: That whosoever loveth the Jews,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/> like Iscariot,
            who was their friend, or the pagans, who worship creatures instead of the
            Creator,—should not enter in amongst them and minister; and moreover, that if he be
            already amongst them, they should not suffer him to remain, but that he should be
            separated from amongst them, and not minister with them again.</p>
         <p>16. The apostles further appointed: That, if any one from the Jews or from the pagans
            come and join himself with them, and if after he has joined himself with them he turn
            and go back again to the side on which he stood before, and if he again return and come
            to them a second time,—he should not be received again; but that, according to the side
            on which he was before, so those who know him should look upon him.</p>
         <p>17. The apostles further appointed: That it should not be permitted to the Guide to
            transact the matters which pertain to the Church apart from those who minister with him;
            but that he should issue commands with the counsel of them all, and that that only
            should be done which all of them should concur in and not disapprove.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n38"/></p>
         <p>18. The apostles further appointed: Whenever any shall depart out of this world with a
            good testimony to the faith of Christ, and with affliction borne for His name’s sake,
            make ye a commemoration of them on the day on which they were put to death.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39"/></p>
         <p>19. The apostles further appointed: In the service of the Church repeat ye the praises
            of David day by day: because of this saying: “I will bless the Lord at all times, and at
            all times His praises shall be in my mouth;”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40"/> and this: “By day and by night will I
            meditate and speak, and cause my voice to be heard before Thee.”</p>
         <p>20. The apostles further appointed: If any divest themselves of mammon and run not after
            the gain of money, let these men be chosen and admitted to the ministry of the
            altar.</p>
         <p>21. The apostles further appointed: Let any priest who accidentally puts another in
            bonds<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41"/> contrary to justice receive the punishment that is right; and let him that has
            been bound receive the bonds as if he had been equitably bound.</p>
         <p>22. The apostles further appointed: If it be seen that those who are accustomed to hear
            causes show partiality, and pronounce the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent, let
            them never again hear another cause: thus receiving the rebuke of their partiality, as
            it is fit.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42"/></p>
         <p>23. The apostles further ordained: Let not those that are high-minded and lifted up with
            the arrogance of boasting be admitted to the ministry: because of this text: “That which
            is exalted among men is abominable before God;” and because concerning them it is said:
            “I will return a recompense upon those that vaunt themselves.”</p>
         <p>24. The apostles further appointed: Let there be a Ruler over the elders who are in the
            villages, and let him be recognised as head of them all, at whose hand all of them shall
            be required: for Samuel also thus made visits from place to place and ruled.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43"/></p>
         <p>25. The apostles further appointed: That those kings who shall hereafter believe in
            Christ should be permitted to go up and stand before the altar along with the Guides of
            the Church: because David also, and those who were like him, went up and stood before
            the altar.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44"/></p>
         <p>26. The apostles further appointed: Let no man dare to do anything by the authority of
            the priesthood which is not in accordance with justice and equity, but in accordance
            with justice, and free from the blame of partiality, let all things be done.</p>
         <p>27. The apostles further appointed: Let the bread of the Oblation be placed upon the
            altar on the day on which it is baked, and not some days after—a thing which is not
            permitted.</p>
         <p>All these things did the apostles appoint, not for themselves, but for those who should
            come after them—for they were apprehensive that in time to come wolves would put on
            sheep’s clothing: since for themselves the Spirit, the Paraclete, which was in them, was
            sufficient: that, even as He had appointed these laws by their hands, so He would guide
            them lawfully. For they, who had received from our Lord power and authority, had no need
            that laws should be appointed for them by others. For Paul also, and Timothy,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n45"/> while
            they were going from place to place in the country of Syria and Cilicia, committed these
            same Commands and Laws of the apostles and elders to those who were under the hand of
            the apostles, for the churches of the countries in which they were preaching and
            publishing the Gospel.</p>
         <p>The disciples, moreover, after they had appointed these Ordinances and Laws, ceased not
            from the preaching of the Gospel, or from the wonderful mighty-works which our Lord did
            by their hands. For much people was gathered about them every day, who believed in
            Christ; and they came to them from other cities, and heard their words and received
            them. Nicodemus also, and Gamaliel, chiefs of the synagogue of the Jews, used to come to
            the apostles in secret, agreeing with their teaching. Judas, moreover, and Levi, and
            Peri, and Joseph, and Justus, sons of Hananias, and Caiaphas<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n46"/> and Alexander the
            priests—they too used to come to the apostles by night, confessing Christ that He is the
            Son of God; but they were afraid of the people of their own nation, so that they did not
            disclose their mind toward the disciples.</p>
         <p>And the apostles received them affectionately, saying to them: Do not, by reason of the
            shame and fear of men, forfeit your salvation before God, nor have the blood of Christ
            required of you; even as your fathers, who took it upon them: for it is not acceptable
            before God, that, while ye are, in secret, with His worshippers, ye should go and
            associate with the murderers of His adorable Son. How do ye expect that your faith
            should be accepted with those that are true, whilst ye are with those that are false?
            But it becomes you, as men who believe in Christ, to confess openly this faith which we
            preach.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n47"/></p>
         <p>And, when they heard these things from the Disciples, those sons of the priests, all of
            them alike, cried out before the whole company of the apostles: We confess and believe
            in Christ who was crucified, and we confess that He is from everlasting the Son of God;
            and those who dared to crucify Him do we renounce. For even the priests of the people in
            secret confess Christ; but, for the sake of the headship among the people which they
            love, they are not willing to confess openly; and they have forgotten that which is
            written:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48"/> “Of knowledge is He the Lord, and before Him avail not crafty devices.”</p>
         <p>And, when their fathers heard these things from their sons, they became exceedingly
            hostile to them: not indeed because they had believed in Christ, but because they had
            declared and spoken openly of the mind of their fathers before the sons of their
            people.</p>
         <p>But those who believed clove to the disciples, and departed not from them, because they
            saw that, whatsoever they taught the multitude, they themselves carried into practice
            before all men; and, when affliction and persecution arose against the disciples, they
            rejoiced to be afflicted with them, and received with gladness stripes and imprisonment
            for the confession of their faith in Christ; and all the days of their life they
            preached Christ before the Jews and the Samaritans.</p>
         <p>And after the death of the apostles there were Guides and Rulers<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n49"/> in the churches;
            and, whatsoever the apostles had committed to them and they had received from them, they
            continued to teach to the multitude through the whole space of their lives. They too,
            again, at their deaths committed and delivered to their disciples after them whatsoever
            they had received from the apostles; also what James had written from Jerusalem, and
            Simon from the city of Rome, and John from Ephesus, and Mark from Alexandria the Great,
            and Andrew from Phrygia, and Luke from Macedonia, and Judas Thomas from India:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n50"/> that
            the epistles of an apostle<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n51"/> might be received and read in the churches that were in
            every place, just as the achievements of their Acts, which Luke wrote, are read; that
            hereby the apostles might be known, and the prophets, and the Old Testament and the
            New;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n52"/> that so might be seen one truth was proclaimed in them all: that one Spirit
            spoke in them all, from one God whom they had all worshipped and had all preached. And
            the divers countries received their teaching. Everything, therefore, which had been
            spoken by our Lord by means of the apostles, and which the apostles had delivered to
            their disciples, was believed and received in every country, by the operation<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n53"/> of our
            Lord, who said to them: “I am with you, even until the world shall end;” the Guides
            disputing with the Jews from the books of the prophets, and contending also against the
            deluded pagans with the terrible mighty-works which they did in the name of Christ. For
            all the peoples, even those that dwell in other countries, quietly and silently
            received<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n54"/> the Gospel of Christ; and those who became confessors cried out under their
            persecution: This our persecution to-day shall plead<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55"/> on our behalf, lest we be
            punished, for having been formerly persecutors ourselves. For there were some of them
            against whom death by the sword was ordered; and there were some of them from whom they
            took away whatsoever they possessed, and let them go.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56"/> And the more affliction arose
            against them, the richer and larger did their congregations become; and with gladness in
            their hearts did they receive death of every kind. And by ordination to the priesthood,
            which the apostles themselves had received from our Lord, did their Gospel wing its way
            rapidly into the four quarters of the world. And by mutual visitation they ministered to
            one another.</p>
         <p>1. Jerusalem received the ordination to the priesthood, as did all the country of
            Palestine, and the parts occupied by the Samaritans, and the parts occupied by the
            Philistines, and the country of the Arabians, and of Phœnicia, and the people of

         <p>The other remaining companions of the apostles, moreover went to the distant countries

            whither each one of them went. By his diligence, I say, did Luke write these things, and
            more than these; and he placed them in the hand of Priscus<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n68"/> and Aquilus, his
            disciples; and they accompanied him up to the day of his death, just as Timothy and
