         <p>Some days since we were calling<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> to pay a visit to our brother <persName>Shemashgram</persName>, and
            <persName>Bardesan</persName> came and found us there. And when he had made inquiries after his health,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/>
            and ascertained that he was well, he asked us, <quote>What were you talking about? for I heard
            your voice outside as I was coming in.</quote> For it was his habit, whenever he found us
            talking about anything before he came,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> to ask us, <quote>What were you saying?</quote> that he
            might talk with us about it.</p>
         <p><quote><persName>Avida</persName> here,</quote> said we to him, <quote>was saying to us, ‘If God is one, as ye say, and if He is
            the creator of men, and if it is His will that you should do that which you are
            commanded, why did He not so create men that they should not be able to do wrong, but
            should constantly be doing that which is right? for in this way His will would have been
            accomplished.’</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Tell me, my son <persName>Avida</persName>,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName> to him, <quote>why it has come into thy mind that the
            God of all is not One; or that He is One, but doth not will that men should behave
            themselves justly and uprightly?</quote></p>
         <p><quote>I, sir,</quote> said <persName>Avida</persName>, <quote>have asked these brethren, persons of my own age, in order that
            ‘they’ may return me an answer.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>If,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName> to him, <quote>thou wishest to learn, it were for thy advantage to learn
            from some one who is older than they; but if to teach, it is not requisite for <quote>thee</quote> to
            ask <quote>them,</quote> but rather that thou shouldst induce <quote>them</quote> to ask <quote>thee</quote> what they wish.
            For teachers are <quote>asked</quote> questions, and do not themselves ask them; or, if they ever do
            ask a question, it is to direct the mind of the questioner, so that he may ask properly,
            and they may know what his desire is. For it is a good thing that a man should know how
            to ask questions.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>For my part,</quote> said <persName>Avida</persName>, <quote>I wish to learn; but I began first of all to question my
            brethren here, because I was too bashful to ask thee.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Thou speakest becomingly,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> said <persName>Bardesan</persName>. <quote>But know, nevertheless, that he who asks
            questions properly, and wishes to be convinced, and approaches the way of truth without
            contentiousness, has no need to be bashful; because he is sure by means of the things I
            have mentioned to please him to whom his questions are addressed. If so be, therefore,
            my son, thou hast any opinion of thy own<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> respecting this matter about which thou hast
            asked, tell it to us all; and, if we too approve of it, we shall express our agreement
            with thee; and, if we do not approve of it, we shall be under obligation to show thee
            why we do not approve of it. But if thou wast simply desirous of becoming acquainted
            with this subject, and hast no opinion of thy own about it, as a man who has but lately
            joined the disciples and is a recent inquirer, I will tell thee respecting it; so that
            thou mayest not go from us empty away. If, moreover, thou art pleased with those things
            which I shall say to thee, we have other things besides to tell thee<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> concerning this
            matter; but, if thou art not pleased, we on our part shall have stated our views without
            any personal feeling.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>I too,</quote> said <persName>Avida</persName>, <quote>shall be much gratified<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> to hear and to be convinced: because it
            is not from another that I have heard of this subject, but I have spoken of it to my
            brethren here out of my own mind; and they have not cared to convince me; but they say,
            <quote>Only believe, and thou wilt then be able to know everything.</quote> But for my part, I cannot
            believe unless I be convinced.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Not only,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName>, <quote>is <persName>Avida</persName> unwilling to believe, but there are many others
            also who, because there is no faith in them, are not even capable of being convinced;
            but they are always pulling down and building up, and so are found destitute of all
            knowledge of the truth. But notwithstanding, since <persName>Avida</persName> is not willing to believe, lo!
            I will speak to you who do believe, concerning this matter about which he asks; and thus
            he too will hear something further about it.</quote></p>
         <p>He began accordingly to address us as follows: “Many men are there who have not faith,
            and have not received knowledge from the True Wisdom.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> In consequence of this, they
            are not competent to speak and give instruction to others, nor are they readily inclined
            themselves to hear. For they have not the foundation of faith to build upon, nor have
            they any confidence on which to rest their hope. Moreover, because they are accustomed
            to doubt even concerning God, they likewise have not in them the fear of Him, which
            would of itself deliver them from all other fears: for he in whom there is no fear of
            God is the slave of all sorts of fears. For even with regard to those things of various
            kinds which they disbelieve, they are not certain that they disbelieve them rightly, but
            they are unsettled in their opinions, and have no fixed belief,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> and the taste of
            their thoughts is insipid in their own mouth; and they are always haunted with fear, and
            flushed with excitement, and reckless.</p>
         <p><!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“But with regard to what <persName>Avida</persName> has said: <quote>How is it that God did not so make us that we
            should not sin and incur condemnation?</quote>—if man had been made so, he would not have
            belonged to himself, but would have been the instrument of him that moved him; and it is
            evident also, that he who moves an instrument as he pleases, moves it either for good or
            for evil. And how, in that case, would a man differ from a harp, on which another plays;
            or from a ship, which another guides: where the praise and the blame reside in the hand
            of the performer or the steersman,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> and the harp itself knows not what is played on
            it, nor the ship itself whether it be well steered and guided or ill, they being only
            instruments made for the use of him in whom is the requisite skill? But God in His
            benignity chose not so to make man; but by freedom He exalted him above many of His
            creatures, and even made him equal with the angels. For look at the sun, and the moon,
            and the signs of the zodiac,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> and all the other creatures which are greater than we
            in some points, and see how individual freedom has been denied them, and how they are
            all fixed in their course by decree, so that they may do that only which is decreed for
            them, and nothing else. For the sun never says, I will not rise at my appointed time;
            nor the moon, I will not change, nor wane, nor wax; nor does any one of the stars say, I
            will not rise nor set; nor the sea, I will not bear up the ships, nor stay within my
            boundaries; nor the mountains, We will not continue in the places in which we are set;
            nor do the winds say, We will not blow; nor the earth, I will not bear up and sustain
            whatsoever is upon me. But all these things are servants, and are subject to one decree:
            for they are the instruments of the wisdom of God, which erreth not.</p>
         <p><!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“Not so, however, with man: for, if everything ministered, who would be he that is
            ministered to? And, if everything were ministered to, who would be he that ministered?
            In that case, too, there would not be one thing diverse from another: yet that which is
            one, and in which there is no diversity of parts, is a being<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> which up to this time
            has not been fashioned. But those things which are destined<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> for ministering have
            been fixed in the power of man: because in the image of <persName>Elohim</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> was he made.
            Therefore have these things, in the benignity of God, been given to him, that they may
            minister to him for a season. It has also been given to him to be guided by his own
            will; so that whatever he is able to do, if he will he may do it, and if he do not will
            he may not do it, and that so he may justify himself or condemn. For, had he been made
            so as not to be able to do evil and thereby incur condemnation, in like manner also the
            good which he did would not have been his own, and he could not have been justified by
            it. For, if any one should not of his own will do that which is good or that which is
            evil, his justification and his condemnation would rest simply with that Fortune to
            which he is subjected.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/></p>
         <p><!-- eb, This quote closes in another paragraph. Oxygen won't let me close the quote across two paragraphs. -->“It will therefore be manifest to you, that the goodness of God is great toward man, and
            that freedom has been given to him in greater measure than to any of those elemental
            bodies<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> of which we have spoken, in order that by this freedom he may justify
            himself, and order his conduct in a godlike manner, and be copartner with angels, who
            are likewise possessed of personal freedom. For we are sure that, if the angels likewise
            had not been possessed of personal freedom, they would not have consorted with the
            daughters of men, and sinned, and fallen from their places. In like manner, too, those
            other angels, who did the will of their Lord, were, by reason of their self-control,
            raised to higher rank, and sanctified, and received noble gifts. For every being in
            existence is in need of the Lord of all; of His gifts also there is no end.</p>
         <p>Know ye, however, notwithstanding what I have said, that even those things of which I
            have spoken as subsisting by decree are not absolutely destitute of all freedom; and on
            this account, at the last day, they will all be made subject to judgment.”</p>
         <p>“But how,” said I to him, “should those things which are fixed and regulated by decree
            be judged?”</p>
         <p>“Not inasmuch as they are fixed, O <persName>Philip</persName>,” said he, “will the elements be judged, but
            inasmuch as they are endowed with power. For beings<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> are not deprived of their
            natural properties<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> when they come to be fashioned, but only of the full exercise of
            their strength,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> suffering a decrease<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/> of power through their intermingling one
            with another, and being kept in subjection by the power of their Maker; and in so far as
            they are in subjection they will not be judged, but in respect of that only which is
            under their own control.”</p>
         <p><quote>Those things,</quote> said <persName>Avida</persName> to him, <quote>which thou hast said, are very good; but, lo! the
            commands which have been given to men are severe, and they cannot perform them.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>This,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName>, <!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“is the saying of one who has not the will to do that which is
            right; nay, more, of him who has already yielded obedience and submission to his foe.
            For men have not been commanded to do anything but that which they are able to do. For
            the commandments set before us are only two, and they are such as are compatible with
            freedom and consistent with equity: one, that we refrain from everything which is wrong,
            and which we should not like to have done to ourselves; and the other, that we should do
            that which is right, and which we love and are pleased to have done to us likewise. Who,
            then, is the man that is too weak to avoid stealing, or to avoid lying, or to avoid acts
            of profligacy, or to avoid hatred and deception? For, lo! all these things are under the
            control of the mind of man; and are not dependent on<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> the strength of the body, but
            on the will of the soul. For even if a man be poor, and sick, and old, and disabled in
            his limbs, he is able to avoid doing all these things. And, as he is able to avoid doing
            these things, so is he able to love, and to bless, and to speak the truth, and to pray
            for what is good for every one with whom he is acquainted; and if he be in health, and
            capable of working,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> he is able also to give of that which he has; moreover, to
            support with strength of body him that is sick and enfeebled—this also he can do.</p>
         <p><quote>Who, then, it is that is not capable of doing that which men destitute of faith
            complain of, I know not. For my part, I think that it is precisely in respect to these
            commandments that man has more power than in anything else. For they are easy, and there
            are no circumstances that can hinder their performance. For we are not commanded to
            carry heavy loads of stones, or of timber, or of anything else, which those only who
            have great bodily strength can do; nor to build fortresses<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> and found cities, which
            kings only can do; nor to steer a ship, which mariners only have the skill to steer; nor
            to measure and divide land, which land-measurers only know how to do; nor to practise
            any one of those arts which are possessed by some, while the rest are destitute of them.
            But there have been given to us, in accordance with the benignity of God, commandments
            having no harshness in them<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/>—such as any living man whatsoever<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> may rejoice to
            do.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> For there is no man that does not rejoice when he does that which is right, nor
            any one that is not gladdened within himself if he abstains from things that are
            bad—except those who were not created for this good thing, and are called tares.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> For
            would not the judge be unjust who should censure a man with regard to any such thing as
            he has not the ability to do?</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Sayest thou of these deeds, O <persName>Bardesan</persName>,” said <persName>Avida</persName> to him, “that they are easy to
            do?</quote></p>
         <p><quote>To him that hath the will,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName>, <quote>I have said, and do still say, that they
            are easy. For this obedience I contend for is the proper behaviour of a free mind,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/>
            and of the soul which has not revolted against its governors. As for the action of the
            body, there are many things which hinder it: especially old age, and sickness, and
            poverty.</quote></p>
         <p><quote>Possibly,</quote> said <persName>Avida</persName>, <quote>a man may be able to abstain from the things that are bad; but
            as for doing the things that are good, what man is capable of this?</quote></p>
         <p><quote>It is easier,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName>, <!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“to do good than to abstain from evil. For the good comes
            from the man himself,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> and therefore he rejoices whenever he does good; but the evil
            is the work of the Enemy, and therefore it is that, only when a man is excited by some
            evil passion, and is not in his sound natural condition,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/> he does the things that are
            bad. For know, my son, that for a man to praise and bless his friend is an easy thing;
            but for a man to refrain from taunting and reviling one whom he hates is not easy:
            nevertheless, it is possible. When, too, a man does that which is right, his mind is
            gladdened, and his conscience at ease, and he is pleased for every one to see what he
            does. But, when a man behaves amiss and commits wrong, he is troubled and excited, and
            full of anger and rage, and distressed in his soul and in his body; and, when he is in
            this state of mind, he does not like to be seen by any one; and even those things in
            which he rejoices, and which are accompanied with praise and blessing from others, are
            spurned from his thoughts, while those things by which he is agitated and disturbed are
            rendered more distressing to him because accompanied by the curse of conscious
            guilt.</p>
         <p><quote>Perhaps, however, some one will say that fools also are pleased when they do abominable
            things. Undoubtedly: but not because they do them as such, nor because they receive any
            conmendation for them, nor because they do them with a good hope;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> nor does the
            pleasure itself stay long with them. For the pleasure which is experienced in a healthy
            state of the soul, with a good hope, is one thing; and the pleasure of a diseased state
            of the soul, with a bad hope, is another. For lust is one thing, and love is another;
            and friendship is one thing, and good-fellowship another; and we ought without any
            difficulty to understand that the false counterfeit of affection which is called lust,
            even though there be in it the enjoyment of the moment, is nevertheless widely different
            from true affection, whose enjoyment is for ever, incorruptible and indestructible.</quote></p>
         <p><quote><persName>Avida</persName> here,</quote> said I to him, <quote>has also been speaking thus: <quote>It is from his nature that
            man does wrong; for, were he not naturally formed to do wrong, he would not do it.</quote></quote></p>
         <p><quote>If all men,</quote> said <persName>Bardesan</persName>, <!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“acted alike,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/> and followed one bias,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/> it would then
            be manifest that it was their nature that guided them, and that they had not that
            freedom of which I have been speaking to you. That you may understand, however, what is
            nature and what is freedom, I will proceed to inform you.</p>
         <p><!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“The nature of man is, that he should be born, and grow up, and rise to his full
            stature, and produce children, and grow old, eating and drinking, and sleeping and
            waking, and that then he should die. These things, because they are of nature, belong to
            all men; and not to all men only, but also to all animals whatsoever,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n36"/> and some of
            them also to trees. For this is the work of physical nature,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/> which makes and
            produces and regulates everything just as it has been commanded. Nature, I say, is found
            to be maintained among animals also in their actions. For the lion eats flesh, in
            accordance with his nature; and therefore all lions are eaters of flesh. The sheep eats
            grass; and therefore all sheep are eaters of grass. The bee makes honey, by which it is
            sustained; therefore all bees are makers of honey. The ant collects for herself a store
            in summer, from which to sustain herself in winter; and therefore do all ants act
            likewise. The scorpion strikes with its sting him who has not hurt it; and thus do all

            cease to propagate: nor is Fate able to give them offspring at a time when the body has
            not the natural power to give them. Neither, again, is Fate able to preserve the body of
            man in life without meat and drink; nor yet, even when it has meat and drink, to grant

            Thus, from Nature comes the growth and perfecting of the body; but apart from Nature,
            that is by Fate, come diseases and blemishes in the body. From Nature comes the union of
            male and female, and the unalloyed happiness of them both; but from Fate comes hatred

            from influencing the entire circumference of the world. In the whole of <placeName>Media</placeName>, all men
            when they die, and even while life is still remaining in them, are cast to the dogs, and
            the dogs eat the dead of the whole of <placeName>Media</placeName>. Yet we cannot say that all the <persName>Medians</persName> are
            born having the Moon posited with <persName>Mars</persName> in <placeName>Cancer</placeName> in the day-time beneath the earth: for
            it is written that those whom dogs eat are so born. The <persName>Hindoos</persName>, when they die, are all
            of them burnt with fire, and many of their wives are burnt along with them alive. But we
            cannot say that all those women of the <persName>Hindoos</persName> who are burnt had at their Nativity Mars
            and the Sun posited in Leo in the night-time beneath the earth, as those persons are
            born who are burnt with fire. All the <persName>Germans</persName> die by strangulation,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n93"/> except those who
            are killed in battle. But it is a thing impossible, that, at the Nativity of all the
            <persName>Germans</persName> the Moon and Hora should have been posited between <persName>Mars</persName> and Saturn. The truth
            is, that in all countries, every day, and at all hours, men are born under Nativities
            diverse from one another, and the laws of men prevail over the decree of the stars, and
            they are governed by their customs. Fate does not compel the <persName>Seres</persName> to commit murder
            against their wish, nor the <persName>Brahmans</persName> to eat flesh; nor does it hinder the <persName>Persians</persName> from

            any man within the circumference of the whole world to cultivate the art of the <persName>Muses</persName>;
            but, as I have already said, in every country and in every nation all men avail
            themselves of the freedom of their nature in any way they choose, and, by reason of the
            body with which they are clothed, do service to Fate and to Nature, sometimes as they
            wish, and at other times as they do not wish. For in every country and in every nation

            be found differing from one another. For there are not seven kinds of laws only found in

            kingdom, from country to country, from district to district, and in every abode of man,
            differing one from another. For ye remember what I said to you—that in one zone, that of
            the <persName>Hindoos</persName>, there are many men that do not eat the flesh of animals, and there are
            others that even eat the flesh of men. And again, I told you, in speaking of the

            for wives their daughters and their sisters, but that in every country to which they
            have gone they have followed the law of their fathers, and have preserved the mystic
            arts contained in that teaching which they delivered to them. And again, remember that I
            told you of many nations spread abroad over the entire circuit of the world,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95"/> who
            have not been confined to any one zone, but have dwelt in every quarter from which the
            wind blows,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n96"/> and in all the zones, and who have not the arts which <persName>Mercury</persName> and <persName>Venus</persName>
            are said to have given when in conjunction with each other. Yet, if laws were regulated
            by zones, this could not be; but they clearly are not: because those men I have spoken

         <p><persName>Bardesan</persName>, therefore, an aged man, and one celebrated for his knowledge of events, wrote,
            in a certain work which was composed by him, concerning the synchronisms<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n107"/> with one
            another of the luminaries of heaven, speaking as follows:—</p>
         <p>Two revolutions of Saturn,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n108"/> 60 years;</p>
         <p>5 revolutions of Jupiter, 60 years;</p>
         <p>40 revolutions of Mars, 60 years;</p>
         <p>60 revolutions of the Sun, 60 years;</p>
         <p>72 revolutions of <persName>Venus</persName>, 60 years;</p>
         <p>150 revolutions of <persName>Mercury</persName>, 60 years;</p>
         <p>720 revolutions of the Moon, 60 years.</p>
         <p>And this,” says he, <!-- eb, There is no close to this quote. -->“is one synchronism of them all; that is, the time of one such
            synchronism of them. So that from hence it appears that to complete 100 such
            synchronisms there will be required six thousands of years. Thus:—</p>
         <p>200 revolutions of Saturn, six thousands of years;</p>
         <p>500 revolutions of Jupiter, 6 thousands of years;</p>
         <p>4 thousand revolutions of Mars, 6 thousands of years;</p>
         <p>Six thousand revolutions of the Sun, 6 thousands of years;</p>
         <p>7 thousand and 200 revolutions of <persName>Venus</persName>, 6 thousands of years;</p>
         <p>12 thousand revolutions of <persName>Mercury</persName>, 6 thousands of years;</p>
         <p>72 thousand revolutions of the Moon, 6 thousands of years.”</p>
         <p>These things did <persName>Bardesan</persName> thus compute when desiring to show that this world would stand
            only six thousands of years.</p>

               remarks that it could only come from <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign>, which verb, however, throws away its <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign>,
               so that the form would be <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign>. He suggests, doubtfully, that the right reading is
               <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign>, which is used occasionally for appetite, and forms such an adjective
               in the sense of animosus, animâ praeditus; and that if so, it may, like <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign> in Jude 19
               and 1 Cor. xv. 44, 46, be = ψυχικοί, having an animal nature, sensual. Eusebius and

            <note xml:id="n84">Cureton’s rendering, “and some adorn themselves,” etc., is not so good,
               as being a repetition of what has already been said. It is also doubtful whether the
               words can be so construed. The Greek of Eusebius gives the sense as in the text:
               <foreign xml:lang="grc">κοσμοῦσαι πολλῷ χρυσῷ καὶ λίθοις βαρυτίμοις τοὺς ἵππους</foreign>. If <foreign xml:lang="">***<!-- Add Syriac/Arabic/etc. --></foreign>, horses, be masc., or
               masc. only, as Bernstein gives it, the participle should be altered to the same
               gender. But Dr. Payne Smith remarks that Amira in his Grammar makes it fem. Possibly
               the word takes both genders; possibly, too, the women of Bactria rode on
