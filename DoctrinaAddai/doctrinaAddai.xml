        <p>THE letter of king Abgar,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n2"/> the son of king Ma'nu, and at
            what time he sent it to our Lord at Jerusalem; and at what time Addai the Apostle came
            to him (Abgar) at Edessa;<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n3"/> and what he spake in the gospel
            of his preaching; and what he said and commanded, when he went forth from, this world,
            to those who had received from him the hand of the priesthood.</p>
        <p>In the three hundred and forty and third year of the kingdom of the 
            Greeks,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n4"/> and in the reign of our lord Tiberius, the Roman Emperor, and
            in the reign of king Abgar, son of king Ma'nu, in the month of October, on the twelfth
            day, Abgar Ukkama sent Marihab and Shamshagram,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n5"/> chiefs and
            honoured persons of his kingdom,<pb n="2"/> and
                Hannan<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n6"/> the tabularius, the sharrir, with them, to the
            city which is called Eleutheropolis, but in Aramaic Beth-gubrin,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n7"/> 
            to the honoured Sabinus, the son of Eustorgius, the deputy of
            our lord the emperor, who ruled over Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine, and the whole country
            of Mesopotamia. They brought him letters concerning the affairs of the kingdom; and when
            they went to him, he received them with joy and honour, and they were with him twenty
            and five days. He wrote for them a reply<sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n8"/>
            </sup>to the letters, and sent them to Abgar the king. When they went forth from him,
            they set out and came on the way towards Jerusalem; and they saw many men, who came from
            a distance to see Christ, because the fame of his wonderful deeds had gone forth to
            remote countries. When Marihab, Shamshagram, and Hannan, the keeper of the archives, saw
            the men, they also came with them to Jerusalem. When they 
            entered<pb n="3"/> Jerusalem, they saw Christ, and they rejoiced with the
            multitudes, who were joined to Him. But they saw also the Jews, who were standing in
            groups, and were considering what they should do to Him; for they were disturbed to see
            that a multitude of their people confessed Him. And they were there in Jerusalem ten
            days, and Hannan, the keeper of the archives, wrote down everything which he saw that
            Christ did; also the rest of that done by Him, before they went thither. And they
            departed and came to Edessa, and entered into the presence of Abgar the king, their
            lord, who had sent them, and they gave him the reply of the letters, which they had
            brought with them. After the letters were read, they began to recount before the king
            all which they had seen and all which Christ had done in Jerusalem. And Hannan, the
            keeper of the archives, read before him all which he had written and brought with him;
            and when Abgar the king heard, he was astonished and wondered, as also his princes, who
            stood before him. Abgar said to them: These mighty works are not of men, but of God;
            because there is not any one who can make the dead alive, but God only. And Abgar wished
            himself to pass over and go to Palestine, and see with his own eyes all which Christ was
            doing; but because he was not able to pass through the country of the Romans, which was
            not his, lest this cause should call forth bitter enmity, he wrote a letter and sent it
            to Christ by the hand of Hannan, the keeper of the archives. He went forth from Edessa
            on the fourteenth day of Adar,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n9"/> and entered Jerusalem on the
            twelfth day of Nisan,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n10"/> on the fourth day of the week
            (Wednesday). And he found Christ at the house of<pb n="4"/> Gamaliel, the 
            chief priest<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n11"/> of the
            Jews. The letter was read before Him, which was written thus:----<quote>Abgar Ukkama, to
            Jesus, the Good Physician, who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem. My Lord: Peace.
            I have heard of Thee and of Thy healing, that it is not by medicines and roots Thou
            healest, but by Thy word Thou openest <i>the eyes of </i>the blind, Thou makest the lame
            to walk, cleansest the lepers, and makest the deaf to hear. And unclean 
            spirits<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n12"/> and lunatics, and those tormented, them Thou healest by
            Thy word; Thou also raisest the dead. And when I heard of these great wonders which Thou
            doest, I decided in my mind that either Thou art God, who hast come down from heaven and
            doest these things, or Thou art the Son of God, who doest all these things. Therefore, I
            have written to request of Thee to come to me who adore Thee, and to heal the disease
            which I have, as I believe in Thee. This also I have heard, that the Jews murmur against
            Thee and persecute Thee, and even seek to crucify Thee, and contemplate treating Thee
            cruelly. I possess one small and beautiful city, and it is sufficient for both to dwell
            in it in quietness.</quote></p>
        <p>When Jesus received the letter at the house of the chief priest of the Jews, He said to
            Hannan, the keeper of the archives: <quote>Go and say to thy lord, who hath sent thee to Me,
            <quote>Blessed art thou, who, although thou hast not seen Me, believest in Me, for it is
            written of Me,<sub> </sub>Those who see Me will not believe in Me, and those who see Me
            not, will believe in me.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n13"/> But as to that 
            which<pb n="5"/> thou hast written to Me, that I should come
            to thee, that for which I was sent here is now finished, and I am going up to my Father,
            who sent me, and when I have gone up to Him, I will send to thee one of my disciples,
            who will cure the disease which thou hast, and restore thee to health; and all who are
            with thee he will convert to everlasting life. Thy city shall be blessed, and no enemy
            shall again become master of it for ever.</quote></quote></p>
        <p>When Hannan, the keeper of the archives, saw that Jesus spake thus to him, by virtue of
            being the king's painter, he took and painted a likeness of Jesus with choice paints,
            and brought with him to Abgar the king, his master. And when Abgar the king saw the
            likeness, he received it with great joy, and placed it with great honour in one of his
            palatial houses. Hannan, the keeper of the archives, related to him everything which he
            had heard from Jesus, as His words were put by him in writing. After that Christ had
            ascended to heaven, Judas Thomas<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n14"/> sent to Abgar, Addai the
            Apostle, who was one of the seventy-two Apostles. And when Addai came to the city of
            Edessa, he dwelt at the house of<pb n="6"/> Tobias,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n15"/> son 
            of Tobias the Jew, who was of Palestine. Through
            all the city <i>a report </i>was heard of him, and one of the nobles of Abgar whose name
            was Abdu,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n16"/> the son of Abdu, one of those who sat with
            bended knees <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n17"/>
            dwells here, he of whom Jesus sent to thee, <quote>I send to Thee one of my disciples</quote>. And
            when Abgar heard these <i>words, </i>and the mighty acts which Addai did, and the
            wonderful cures which he effected, he thought for certain in his mind: Truly this is he
            whom Jesus sent, saying, <quote>When I have ascended to heaven I will send to thee one of my
            disciples, and he will cure thy disease</quote>. And Abgar sent and called for Tobias, and said
            to him, I have heard that a certain powerful man has come, and dwells in thy house.
            Bring him up to me; a good hope of recovery through him has been found for me. Tobias
            went early on the next day and took Addai the Apostle, and brought him up to Abgar,
            Addai himself knowing that by the power of God he was sent to him. And when Addai came
            up and went to Abgar, his nobles standing with him, and in going towards him, a
            wonderful vision was seen by Abgar in the face of Addai. At the moment that Abgar saw
            the vision, he fell down and worshipped Addai. Great astonishment seized all those who
            were standing before him, for they saw not the vision which<pb n="7"/> was seen 
            by Abgar. Then Abgar said to Addai, <quote>Of a
            truth thou art the disciple of Jesus, that mighty one, the son of God, who sent to me
            saying I send thee one of my disciples for healing and for life</quote>. Addai said to him,
            <quote>Because that from the beginning thou didst believe in Him who sent me to thee,
            therefore have I been sent to thee, and if thou believest in Him, everything in which
            thou dost believe thou shalt have</quote>. Abgar said to him, <quote>So have I believed in Him, that
            with respect to those Jews who crucified Him, I desire to take with me an army, and to
            go and destroy them; but because the kingdom belongs to the Romans, I was restrained by
            the covenant of peace, which was confirmed by me with our lord the emperor Tiberius,
            like my forefathers</quote>. Addai said to him, <quote>Our Lord has fulfilled the will of His Father.
            And when He had completed the will of His Parent, He was taken up to His Father, and sat
            with Him in glory, with whom he was from eternity</quote>. Abgar said to him: <quote>I also believe
            in Him and in His Father</quote>. Addai said to him:<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n18"/> <quote>Because
            that thou so believest, I place my hand on thee, in the name of Him in whom thou
            believest</quote>.</p>
        <p>At the moment that he placed his hand upon him, he was cured of the plague of the
            disease, which he had had for a long time.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n19"/> Abgar wondered
            and was astonished,<pb n="8"/> that as it was reported
            to him concerning Jesus, that which He did and cured; so also Addai himself, without
            medicine of any kind, healed in the name of Jesus. And also with respect to Abdu, the
            son of Abdu, he had the gout in his feet, and he too brought his feet near him, and he
            (Addai) placed his hand upon them and healed him; and he had not the gout again. And
            also in all the city he wrought great cures, and showed wonderful mighty works in it.
            Abgar said to him: <quote>Now that every man knoweth that by the power of Jesus Christ thou
            doest these wonderful works, and behold we are wondering at thy works, I require
            therefore of thee, that thou wouldest recount to us concerning the coining of Christ,
            how it was, and concerning His glorious power, and concerning those miracles which we
            have heard that He did, which thou hast seen with the rest of thy companions</quote>. Addai
            said to him: <quote>I will not keep silent from declaring this; for because of this I was sent
            here to speak and to teach every one, who, like thee, is willing to believe. Tomorrow
            assemble for me all the city, that I may sow in it the Word of Life, by the preaching
            which I will preach before you concerning the coming of Christ, how it was, and
            concerning His glorious power, and concerning Him that sent Him, for what and how He
            sent Him, and concerning His power and His wonderful works, and concerning the glorious
            mysteries of His coming, which He spake in the world, and concerning the certitude of
            His preaching, how and for what He abased Himself, and humbled His 
            exalted<pb n="9"/> divinity by the body, which He took, and was
            crucified and descended to the house of the dead, and cleaved the wall of partition,
            which had never been cleft, and gave life to the dead by being Himself slain, and
            descended by Himself, and ascended with many to His glorious Father, with whom He was
            from, eternity in one exalted divinity</quote>. And Abgar commanded that they should deliver to
            Addai silver and gold. Addai said to him: <quote>How are we able to receive anything which is
            not ours? for, behold, that which was ours we have forsaken, as we were commanded by our
            Lord to be without purses and without scrips, and carrying crosses upon our shoulders,
            we were commanded to preach His Gospel to the whole creation: the whole creation felt
            and suffered by His crucifixion, which was for us, for the salvation of all men</quote>. And he
            narrated before Abgar the king, and before his princes and his nobles, and before
            Augustina, the mother of Abgar, and before Shalmath, the daughter of Meherdath, the wife
            of Abgar,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n20"/> the signs of our Lord and His wonders, and the
            glorious miracles which He wrought, and His divine triumphs, and His ascension to His
            Father; and how they received powers and authorities at the time that He ascended, by
            which same power he had healed Abgar and Abdu, the son of Abdu, the second person of his
            kingdom; and how he made them know that which would be revealed at the end of times, and
            in the consummation of all creatures, and the resuscitation and resurrection, which is
            about to be for all men, and the separation which is to be between the sheep 
            and<pb n="10"/> the goats, and between the faithful and
            the unbelieving. And he said to them: "Because that the gate of life is strait and the
            way of truth is narrow, therefore few are the believers of truth, and in the power of
            unbelief is Satan's recreation. Because of this there are many liars, who cause to err
            those who look on. For except that there is a good end for faithful men, our Lord had
            not descended from heaven, and come to the birth, and to the suffering of death, and
            also He had not sent us<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n21"/> to be His preachers and
            evangelists. Those things which we saw and heard from Him, which He did and taught, we
            confidently preach before all men; for we would not do any wrong with respect to the
            truth of His Gospel. And not these things only; but also those which were done in His
            Name, after His ascension, we show and preach.</p>
        <p>I will tell before you that which happened and was done in the presence of men, who, as
            you, believed in Christ, that He is the Son of the living God. Protonice, the wife of
            the Emperor Claudius,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n22"/> whom Tiberius made 
            second<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n23"/> in his kingdom, when he went to make war with the
            Spaniards, who had rebelled against him, this woman, when Simon, one of the disciples,
            was in the city of Rome, and she saw the signs and wonders, and<pb n="11"/> marvellous 
            works which he did in the name of Christ;
            denied the paganism of her fathers in which she was brought up, and the idolatrous
            images which she had worshipped; and she believed in Christ our Lord, and worshipped
            Him, and praised with those who were joined unto Simon, and held Him in great honour.
            After this she wished also to see Jerusalem, and those places in which the mighty works
            of our Lord were done. So she arose promptly and descended from Rome to Jerusalem, 
            she<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n24"/> and her two sons with her, and her one virgin daughter.</p>
        <p>When she was entering Jerusalem, the city went forth to meet her, and they received her
            with great honour, as that which is due to the queen, the mistress of the great country
            of the Romans. But James, who was made director and ruler in the church which was built
            for us there, when he had heard for what purpose she had gone there, arose and went to
            her. And he entered into her presence where she was dwelling, in the royal great palace
            of king Herod. When she saw him, she received him with great joy, as also she had Simon
            Peter. He also showed her cures and mighty works as did Simon, and she said to him:
            "Show me Golgotha, on which Christ was crucified, and the wood of His cross on which He
            was suspended by the Jews, and the grave in which<pb n="12"/> He was placed." 
            James said to her: "These three things which
            thy Majesty wishes to see are under the control of the Jews. They possess them, and
            permit us not to go to pray there before Golgotha and the grave, and neither the wood of
            His cross will they give us.#nbsp# And not only this, but they also severely persecute
            us, that we may not publish and preach in the name of Christ, and many times also they
            bind us in prison." When she heard these things, the queen immediately commanded, and
            they brought before her Onias, the son of Hannan the priest, and Gedalia, son of
            Caiaphas, and Judah the son of Ebed Shalom, chiefs and rulers of the Jews. And she said
            to them: "Deliver up Golgotha, and the grave, and the wood of the cross, to James, and
            those who agree with him, and let no man forbid them to minister there according to the
            custom of their ministry." And when she had so commanded the priests, she arose to go
            and see these places, and she also delivered that place to James, and those who were
            with him. Afterwards she entered the grave, and found in the grave three crosses, one of
            our Lord, and two of those robbers, who were crucified with Him, on His right hand and
            on His left. And at the time that she entered into the grave----she and her children
            with her----at that instant her virgin daughter fell down and died, without pain,
            without disease, and without any cause of death. And when the queen saw that her
            daughter had died suddenly, she kneeled and prayed within the grave, and said in her
            prayer: "God, who gave Himself to death for all men, and was crucified in this place,
            and was laid in this grave; and as God, who keepeth alive all, has risen, and made many
            to rise with Him, lest the Jews, the crucifiers, should hear----and also the erring
            heathens, whose<pb n="13"/> idols and graven images,
            and the terrors of paganism, I have denied----and they see me, deride me, and say that
            all this which has happened to her is because that she denied the gods, which she did
            worship, and confessed Christ, whom she knew not, and went to honour the place of His
            grave and His crucifixion; and if, O my Lord, I am not worthy to be heard, because that
            I have worshipped creatures instead of Thee; spare Thou, for the sake of Thy adorable
            Name, that it may not be blasphemed in this place, as they blasphemed Thee at Thy
            crucifixion." She said these things in her prayer, and, in the excitement of her
            supplication, she repeated them before all those who were there. Her eldest son
            approached her, and said to her: "Hear that which I shall say before thy Majesty. I
            think thus in my mind and in my thought, that this death of this my sister, which was
            sudden, was not for nought; but this is a wonderful work, in which God will be praised,
            and not that His Name will be blasphemed, as those thought, who heard it. Behold, we
            enter the grave and find in it three crosses, and we know not which of them is the cross
            on which Christ was suspended. In the death of this my sister, we may be able to see and
            to learn which is the cross of Christ, for Christ is not neglectful of those who believe
            in Him, and seek Him." And the queen Protonice----her soul was very sad at this
            time----saw in her mind that her son spake these things wisely, justly and rightly. And
            with her hands she took hold of one of the crosses and placed it upon the dead body of
            her daughter, which lay before her, and she said in her prayer: "O God, who hast shown
            wonderful works in this place, as we hear and believe, if this cross, O Lord, be Thine,
            and on it Thy humanity was suspended by the insolent, show the strong<pb n="14"/> and 
            mighty power of Thy divinity, which dwells
            in the humanity, and restore to life this my daughter, that she may arise, and Thy Name
            be glorified in her. May her soul return to her body, that Thy crucifiers may be
            confounded and Thy worshippers may rejoice! And she waited a long time after she had
            spoken thus. Afterwards she took that cross from the dead body of her daughter, and
            placed another, and also said in her prayer:</p>
        <p>"O God, by whose nod worlds and creatures endure, and wishing the life of all men that
            they may be turned to Him, and is not neglectful of the petition of those who seek Him,
            if this cross be Thine, O Lord, show the power of Thy triumphs as Thou art accustomed,
            and restore to life this my daughter, that she may arise, and the heathens, worshipping
            Thy creatures instead of Thee, may be confounded, and the faithful and the true may
            confess, that their mouth may be opened to Thy praise before those who deny Thee!" And
            she waited a long time after these things, and took the second cross from her daughter;
            and she took the third cross and placed it upon her daughter. And as she was going to
            lift up her eyes to heaven, and to open her mouth in prayer, at that moment, at that
            time, in the twinkling of an eye, that, the cross touched the dead body of her daughter,
            her daughter became alive, and she arose suddenly, and praised God, who had restored her
            to life by His cross. But the queen Protonice, when she saw how her daughter became
            alive, trembled, and was greatly alarmed, but though alarmed she glorified Christ, and
            believed in Him, that He was the Son of the living God. Her son said to her: "My lady,
            thou seest that if this had not occurred today, it might have happened that they would
            have left this cross of Christ, by which my<pb n="15"/> sister became alive, and 
            have taken and honoured that of one of
            those murderous thieves. Now, behold, we see and rejoice, and Christ, who has done this
            thing, is glorified in her."<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n25"/> And she took the cross of
            Christ, and gave it to James, that it might be kept with great honour. She also
            commanded that a great and splendid building should be erected over Golgotha, on which
            He was crucified, and over the grave in which He was placed, so that these places might
            be honoured; and that there should be there a place of assembly for prayer, and a
            gathering for service.</p>
        <p>But the queen, when she saw the whole population of the city, which she had collected
            for the sight of this work, she commanded that, without the covering of honour worn by
            queens, her daughter should go with her unveiled to the palace of the king, in which she
            dwelt, so that every one might see her and praise God. But the people of the Jews and
            the Gentiles, who rejoiced at the beginning of this occurrence, and were glad, became
            very sad at the end of it. For they would have been well pleased if this had not
            occurred, for they saw on account of this many believed in Christ; and especially when
            they saw that the miracles, which were done in His Name after His ascension, were many
            more than those which were done before His ascension. And the fame of this deed which
            was done went forth to<pb n="16"/> distant countries,
            and also to the Apostles, my companions, who preached Christ. And there was rest in the
            churches of Jerusalem, and the cities round about it; and those who saw not this
                <i>deed, </i>with those who did see <i>it, </i>praised God. And when the queen went
            up from Jerusalem to the city of Rome, every city which she entered pressed to see the
            sight of her daughter. And when she had entered Eome, she recounted before the Emperor
            Claudius those things which had happened; and when the Emperor heard, he commanded that
            all the Jews should go forth from the country of Italy. In all that country this deed
            was spoken of by many, and also before Simon Peter this was recounted, which was done.
            "Whatsoever also the Apostles, companions, did, we preach before every man, that those
            who do not know may likewise hear those things which, by our hand, Christ did openly,
            that our Lord might be glorified by every man. These things which I repeat before you
            are told, that ye may know and understand how great is the faith of Christ among those
            who truly join themselves to Him.</p>
        <p>But James, the director of the Church of Jerusalem, who with his own eyes saw the deed,
            gave a written account, and sent it to the Apostles, my companions, in the cities of
            their countries. And also the Apostles themselves gave written accounts, and made known
            to James whatsoever that Christ had done by their hands, and these were read before all
            the multitude of the people of the church.</p>
        <p>But when Abgar the king heard these things, he and Augustina, his mother, and Shalmath,
            the daughter of Meherdath, and Paqûr<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n26"/> and Abdshemesh, 
            and<pb n="17"/> Shamshagram, and Abdu, and Azzai and
            Bar-kalba, with the rest of their companions, rejoiced exceedingly, and all of them
            glorified God, and made their confession in Christ. Abgar the king said to Addai: "I
            wish that everything which we have heard from thee today, and the rest also of the other
            things, thou wouldst tell openly before all the city, that every man may hear the
            preaching of the Gospel of Christ, which thou teachest to us, that he may rest and be
            confirmed in the doctrine which thou teachest to us, that many may understand that I
            believed rightly in Christ, in the Letter which I sent to Him, and may know that He is
            God, the Son of God, and thou art His true and faithful disciple, and that thou showest
            by works His glorious power before those who wish to believe in Him. The day after,
            Abgar commanded Abdu, the son of Abdu, who was healed of a sore disease of his feet, to
            send a herald, that he may proclaim in all the city that the whole population may be
            assembled, men and women, at the place which is called Beththabara, the wide space of
            the house of Avida,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n27"/> the son of Abd-nachad, that they
            might hear the doctrine of Addai the Apostle, and how he taught, and in the name of whom
            he cured, and by what power he wrought these miracles, and those wonders he did. For
            when he healed Abgar the king, it was the nobles only who stood before him, and saw him,
            when he healed him by the word of Christ, whom many physicians were not able to heal,
            but a stranger cured him by the faith of Christ.</p>
        <p>And when all the city were assembled, men and women, as the king had commanded, Avida
            and Labbu, and<pb n="18"/> Chaphsai, and Bar-Kalba,
            and Labubna,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n28"/> and Chesrun,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n29"/>
            and Shamshagram stood there, with their companions, who as they were princes and nobles
            of the king, and commanders, and all the workmen and the artisans and the Jews and
            Gentiles who were in this city, and strangers of the countries of Soba and Harran, and
            the rest of the inhabitants of all this country of Mesopotamia, all of them stood to
            hear the doctrine of Addai; concerning whom they had heard; that he was the disciple of
            Jesus, who was crucified in Jerusalem, and he effected cures in His name. And Addai
            began to speak to them thus:</p>
        <p>"Hear, all of you, and understand that which I speak before you; that I am not a
            physician of medicines and roots, of the art of the sons of men; but I am the disciple
            of Jesus Christ, the Physician of troubled souls, and the Saviour of future life, the
            Son of God, who came down from heaven, and was clothed with a body and became man; and
            He gave Himself and was crucified for all men. And when He was suspended on the wood,
            the sun He made dark in the firmament; and when He had entered the grave, He arose and
            went forth from the grave with many. And those who guarded the grave saw not how He went
            forth from the grave; but the angels of heaven<pb n="19"/> were the preachers 
            and publishers of His resurrection, who if He had
            not wished, had not died, because that He is the Lord of death, the exit <i>of all
                things</i>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n30"/><i> </i>And except it had pleased Him,He
            had not again clothed Himself with a body, for He is Himself the framer of the body. For
            the will which inclined Him to the birth from a virgin, also made Him condescend to the
            suffering of death, and He humbled the majesty of His exalted divinity,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n31"/> 
            who was with His Father from eternity, He of whom Prophets of
            old spake in their mysteries; and they represented images of His birth, and His
            suffering, and His resurrection, and His ascension to His Father, and of His sitting at
            the right hand. And, behold, He is worshipped by celestial spirits, and by the
            inhabitants of the earth, He who is worshipped from eternity. For although His was the
            appearance of men, His might, and His knowledge, and His power were of God Himself; as
            He said to us, <sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n32"/>
            </sup>Behold,<sub> </sub>now is the son of man glorified, and God glorifies Himself in
            Him, by miracles and by wonders, and by honour of being at the right hand. But His body
            is the pure vestment of His glorious divinity, by which we are able to see His invisible
            Lordship. This Jesus Christ, therefore, we preach and publish, and, with Him, we praise
            His Father, and we extol and worship the Spirit of His<pb n="20"/> divinity, 
            because that we were thus commanded by Him, to baptize
            and absolve those who believe in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
            Also the Prophets of old spake thus: that 'The Lord our God and His Spirit hath sent
                us.'<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n33"/> And if I speak anything which is not written in
            the Prophets, the Jews, who are standing among you and hear me, will not receive it; and
            if, again, I make mention of the name of Christ over those who have sufferings and
            diseases, and they are not healed by this glorious name, they, worshipping the work of
            their hands, will not believe. If now these things be written, which we say, in the
            Books of the Prophets,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n34"/> and we are able to show the
            healing powers upon the sick, not a man will look on us without discerning the
                    faith<sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n35"/>
            </sup>which we preach, that God was crucified for all men. If there be those who do not
            wish to acquiesce in these words, let them draw near to us, and reveal to us what is
            their mind, that as a disease of their mind we may apply healing medicine for the cure
            of their wound. For although ye were not present at the time of the suffering of Christ,
            yet because of the sun, which was dark, and ye saw it, learn and understand concerning
            the great hororr there was at the time of the crucifixion of<pb n="21"/> Him 
            whose Gospel has flown over all the earth, by the
            miracles which His disciples, my companions, are working in all the earth. And those who
            were Hebrews, and knew only the Hebrew tongue in which they were born, behold to day
            speak in all languages, that those who are far off, as those who are nigh, might hear
            and believe that He is the same, who confounded<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n36"/> the
            tongues of the impious in this district, which lies before us; He it is who to day
            teaches through us the faith of truth and verity, by humble and wretched men, who were
            from Galilee of Palestine. For I also, whom ye see, am from 
            Paneas,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n37"/> from where the river Jordan goes forth. And I was chosen,
            with my companions, to be a preacher<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n38"/> of this Gospel, by
            which, behold, the regions everywhere resound with the glorious name of the adorable
            Christ. Let, therefore, no man of you harden his heart against the truth and keep his
            mind at a distance from verity. Be ye not led captive after thoughts destructively
            erroneous, which are full of the despair of a bitter 
            death.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n39"/> Be ye not taken by the evil customs of the paganism of your
            fathers, and so keep yourselves at a distance from the life of truth and verity, which
            are in Christ. For those who believe in Him are those who are trusted before Him, who
            descended to us by His favour, to make to cease from the earth the sacrifices of
            heathenism, and the offerings<pb n="22"/> of idolatry;
            that creatures should no longer be worshipped; but we should worship Him and His Father,
            with His Holy Spirit.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n40"/> For I, as my Lord commanded me,
            behold, I preach and I publish. And His silver on the table, behold I cast before you,
            and the seed of His word I sow in the ears of every man. Those who wish to receive,
            theirs is the good reward of confession; and those who do not obey, against them I
            scatter the dust of my feet, as my Lord commanded me. Turn ye, therefore, my beloved,
            from evil ways and from hateful deeds, and turn yourselves to Him with a good and honest
            will, as He turned Himself to you with His grace and His rich mercies. And be ye not as
            the generations of old, which are passed, who, because that they hardened their heart
            against the fear of God, received punishment openly; that they may be chastised, and
            those who came after them may tremble and fear. For that for which our Lord came into
            the world was altogether<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n41"/> to teach and show that at the
            end of created things is a resurrection for all men. And at that time their acts of
            conduct will be represented on their own persons, and their bodies become volumes for
            the written things of justice, and there will not be he who knoweth not writing; because
            that every man shall read the letters of his own book<sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n42"/>
            </sup>at that day, and the account of his actions he taketh with the fingers of his
            hands. Thus the unlettered will know the new writing of the new language, and there is
            not he who will say to his fellow, Read me this, because that one doctrine and one
            instruction shall reign over all men.<pb n="23"/>#nbsp#</p>
        <p>Let this thought, therefore, be represented before your eyes, and let it not pass from
            your mind, because that if it pass from your mind, it passeth not from 
            Justice.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n43"/> Seek mercies from God, that He may pardon the hateful
            infidelity of your paganism, for ye have forsaken Him who created you upon the face of
            the earth, and makes His rain to descend and His sun to rise upon you, and ye worship,
            instead of Him, His works. For the idols and graven images of paganism, and whatsoever
            of the creation in which ye have confidence and which ye worship, if there were in them
            feeling and understanding, for the sake of which ye worship and honour them, it would be
            right for them, which ye have engraven and established, and have firmly fixed with nails
            that they be not shaken, to receive your favour. For if the creatures were aware of your
            honours to them, they would cry, shouting to you, not to worship your fellows, which
            like yourselves are made and created; because that creatures made should not be
            worshipped; but that they should worship their Creator, and they should glorify Him who
            created them. And as His grace covers the wicked here,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n44"/> so
            His justice shall be avenged on the infidels there. For I saw in this city that it
            abounded greatly in paganism, which is against God. Who is this 
            Nebo,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n45"/> an idol made which ye worship,<pb n="24"/> and 
            Bel,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n46"/> which ye honour? Behold,
            there are those among you who adore Bath Nical,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n47"/> as the
            inhabitants of Harran your neighbours, and Taratha,<sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n48"/>
            </sup>as the people of Mabug, and the eagle, as the Arabians, also the sun and the
            moon,as the rest of the inhabitants of Harran, who are as 
            yourselves.<pb n="25"/> Be ye not led away captive by the rays of the
            luminaries and the bright star; for every one who worships creatures is cursed before
            God. For although there are among creatures such as are greater than their companions,
            yet they are fellow-servants of their companions, as I have said to you. For this is a
            bitter pain, for which there is not a cure, that things made should worship things made,
            and creatures should glorify their fellows. For as they are not able to stand by the
            power of themselves, but by the power of Him who created them, so they are not able to
            be worshipped with Him, nor to be honoured with Him; for it is a blasphemy against both
            parties, against the creatures when they are worshipped, and against the Creator, when
            the creatures, who are strangers to the nature of His existence, are made partakers with
            Him. For all the prophecy of the Prophets, and the preaching of us who are after the
            Prophets, is this, that creatures should not be worshipped with the Creator, and that
            men should not bind themselves to the yoke of corrupt paganism. It is not because of the
            creatures being seen, I say, that they should not be worshipped; but everything which is
            made is a creature, whether visible or invisible. This is a horrible wickedness, to
            place the glorious name of divinity upon it. For not creatures, as you, we proclaim and
            worship; but the Lord of creatures. The earthquake, which made them tremble at the
            Cross, testifies that everything which is made depends on and exists by the power of its
            Maker, who was before worlds and creatures, whose nature is incomprehensible, in that
            His nature is invisible, and, with His Father, is sanctified in the heights above, for
            that He is Lord and God from eternity. This is our doctrine in every country and in
            every region. And so<pb n="26"/> have we been
            commanded to preach to those who hear us, not violently, but by the teaching of the
            truth and by the power of God. And the miracles which were done in His name, testify
            concerning our faith, that it is true and to be believed. Be obedient, therefore, to my
            words, and receive that which I have said, and am saying before you; and that I may not
            require your death, behold, I warn you to be very cautious. Receive my words fitly, and
            do not neglect. Draw nigh to me ye my distant ones from Christ, and be near to Christ.
            And in the place Of erroneous sacrifices and oblations, offer now to Him the sacrifices
            of thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>What is this great altar which ye have built in the midst of this city? and what are
            those going and coming offering upon it to demons, and sacrificing on it to devils? But
            if ye know not the Scriptures, doth not nature itself teach you, by its power of sight,
            that your idols have eyes and see not? And ye <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n49"/> who see
            with eyes in that ye do not understand, ye are also as they who see not and hear not,
            and in vain you excite your voices, ineffective to deaf ears. For they are not to be
            complained of for that which they do not hear, because that by nature they are deaf and
            dumb. And the blame with which justice is involved is yours, for ye do not wish to
            understand, even that which ye see. For the thick darkness of error, which is spread
            over your mind, permits you not to acquire the heavenly light, which is the
            understanding of knowledge. Flee, therefore, from things made and created, as I have
            said unto you, that in name only are they called gods, though they are not gods in their
            nature; and draw near to Him, who in His nature is<pb n="27"/> God 
            from eternity and from everlasting, and is not made as your
            idols, and also not a creature, and a work of art as the images in which ye make your
            boast. Because that although He put on this body, He was God with His Father; for the
            works of creation, which trembled when He was slain, and were terrified by the suffering
            of His death, they testify that He is He who created the works of creation. For it was
            not for a man the earth shook, but for Him who established the earth upon the waters;
            and it was not for a man the sun became dark in the heavens, but for Him who made the
            great lights. And it was not by a man the righteous and the just were raised to life,
            but by Him who gave power over death from the beginning. Nor was it by a man the vail of
            the temple of the Jews was rent from the top to the bottom, but by Him who said to them,
            'Behold, your house is left desolate.'<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n50"/> For, behold,
            except they who crucified Him knew that He was the Son of God, they would not have
            proclaimed the desolation of their city, also they would not have brought down woes upon
            themselves. For even if they wished to neglect this confession, the terrible commotions
            which were at that time would not have permitted them. Behold also some of the children
            of the crucifiers have become at this day preachers and evangelists, with the Apostles
            my companions, in all the land of Palestine and among the Samaritans, and in all the
            country of the Philistines. The idols of paganism also are despised, and the Cross of
            Christ is honoured. Peoples and creatures also confess God, who became man. If truly
            when Jesus our Lord was upon earth ye believed in Him that He is the Son of God, and
            before that ye had heard the word of<pb n="28"/> His
            preaching, confessed in Him that He is God; now that He has ascended to His Father, and
            ye have seen the signs and wonders which are done in His name, and the word of His
            Gospel ye have heard with your ears; not a man of you should let himself doubt in his
            mind how the promise of His blessing which He sent to you would have been established
            with you: "Blessed are ye who have believed in me, although ye have not seen me; and
            because ye have so believed in me the city in which ye dwell shall be blessed, and the
            enemy shall not prevail against it for ever."<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n51"/> Do not,
            therefore, turn from His faith; for, behold, ye have heard and seen those things which
            bear witness to His faith, that He is the adorable Son, and is the glorious God, and is
            the triumphant King, and is the Omnipotent Power; and by His true faith a man is able to
            acquire the eye of the true mind, and to perceive that every one who worships creatures,
            the wrath of justice overtakes him.</p>
        <p>For everything which we say before you, we say as we have received of the gift of our
            Lord, and we teach and we show how to possess your life, and not destroy your spirits by
            the error of paganism; because that the heavenly light hath risen upon creation, and He
            it is, who hath chosen the ancient fathers and the just men and the Prophets, and hath
            spoken with them by the revelation of the Holy Spirit. For He is the God of the Jews,
            who crucified Him, and the erring Gentiles also worship Him, though they know <i>it
            </i>not; because that there is no<pb n="29"/> other
            God in heaven and in earth, and behold confession ascendeth up to Him from the four
            quarters of the earth. Behold now your ears have heard that which was not heard by you
                <i>before, </i>and behold, again, your eyes have seen that which was never seen by
            you <i>before. </i>Be ye not therefore unjust to that which ye have heard and seen.
            Cause to pass from you the rebellious mind of your fathers, and free yourselves from the
            yoke of sin, which hath dominion over you by libations and sacrifices before graven
            images. Let it be a care to you concerning your perishing lives, and concerning the vain
            bowing of your head, and acquire the new mind which worships the Maker and not the thing
            made, in which is represented the image of truth and verity, of the Father, and of the
            Son, and of the Holy Spirit, when ye believe and are baptized in the triple and glorious
            names. For this is our doctrine and our preaching. For it is not in many things that the
            truth of Christ is believed. And such of you as are willing to be obedient to Christ,
            know that many times I have repeated my words before you, that ye might learn and
            understand whatsoever ye hear. And we will rejoice in this, as a husbandman in his field
            which is blessed; and our God is glorified by your repentance towards Him. And as ye
            live in this, we also who counsel you thus will not be defrauded of the blessed reward
            of this. And because I am confident that ye are a blessed land, according to the will of
            the Lord Christ, therefore for the dust of my feet which we have been 
            commanded<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n52"/> to shake off against the city that receiveth not our
            words; behold I shake off to-day at the door of your ears the words of my lips, in which
            the<pb n="30"/> coming of Christ is represented, that
            which has been, and that which is about to be, and the resurrection and resuscitation of
            all men, and the separation which is to be between the faithful and unbelieving, and the
            blessed promise of future joys which they who have believed in Christ and worshipped His
            high Father, and confessed Him and the Spirit of His godhead, shall receive. And now it
            is right for us to finish our present discourse, and let those who have received the
            word of Christ remain with us, and also those who wish to be associated, with us in
            prayer, and then let them go to their homes."</p>
        <p>And Addai the Apostle rejoiced in this when he saw that the multitude of the population
            of the city remained with him, and there were few who did not remain at that time; and
            these same few, after a few days, received his words and believed in the gospel of the
            preaching of Christ.</p>
        <p>And when Addai the Apostle had said these things before all the city of Edessa, and
            Abgar the king saw that all the city rejoiced in his doctrine, men and women equally,
            and were saying to him "Christ, who hath sent thee to us is true and faithful," and he
            also greatly rejoiced at this, praising God, that according to what he had heard from
            Hannan, his tabularius, concerning Christ, so he had seen the marvellous mighty works
            which Addai the Apostle had done in the name of Christ. And Abgar the king also said to
            Addai the Apostle, As I sent to Christ by my letter to Him; and as He also sent to me
            and I have received from thee thyself this day; so will I believe all the days of my
            life, and in the same things continue, exulting, because I know that there is no other
            power in the name of whom these signs and wonders are done, but by the power of Christ,
            whom thou preachest in truth and verity. And now I will worship 
            Him,<pb n="31"/> I and Ma'nu,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n53"/> my son,
            and Augustina, and Shalmath the queen. And now, wherever thou wishest, build a church, a
            house of assembly for those who have believed, and shall believe in thy words. And, as
            commanded thee by thy Lord, minister thou at times with confidence. And those who are
            teachers with thee of this Gospel, I am prepared to deliver to them large gifts, that
            they may not have any other work with the ministry. Everything also which is required by
            thee for the expenses of the house, I will give thee without taking account; thy word
            shall be powerful and have rule in this city, and without another man, have thou
            authority to enter into my presence in my royal palace of honour.</p>
        <p>And when Abgar the king went down to his royal palace, he rejoiced, he and his princes
            with him, Abdu and Garmai, and Shamshagram, and Abubai, and Meherdath, with the rest of
            their companions, at everything which their eyes had seen, and their ears had heard, and
            in the joy of their heart they also praised God, who had turned their mind to Him; they
            renounced the paganism in which they stood, and confessed the Gospel of Christ. And when
            Addai had built a church, they offered in it vows and offerings, they and the people of
            the city, and there they worshipped all the days of their life.</p>
        <p>And Avida <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n54"/> and Bar-kalba who were chiefs and rulers, and
            clothed with royal headbands <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n55"/>, drew near to Addai, and
            they asked Addai concerning the<pb n="32"/> history of
            Christ, to tell them how that He being God was seen by them, as man, and how ye were
            able to see Him. And he satisfied them all concerning this, concerning all which their
            eyes had seen, and concerning all which their ears had heard of Him. And every thing
            which the Prophets had said of Him, he repeated before them, and they received his words
            gladly and faithfully, and there was not a man who rose up against him. For the glorious
            things which he did permitted not a man to rise up against him.</p>
        <p>Shavida and Ebednebo, chiefs of the priests of this city, with 
            Piroz<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n56"/> and 
            Dancu <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n57"/> their companions,
            when they saw the signs which he did, ran and threw down the altars upon which they
            sacrificed before Nebo and Bel their gods, except the great altar, which was in the
            midst of the city, and they cried out and said, that this is truly the disciple of the
            distinguished and glorious Master of whom we heard all those things, which He did in the
            country of Palestine. And all who believed in Christ, Addai received, and baptized them
            in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And those who were
            accustomed to worship stones and stocks, sat at his feet, learning, and being corrected
            of the plague of the foolishness of paganism. The Jews also, conversant with the Law and
            the Prophets, who carried on<pb n="33"/> merchandise
            in silks, <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n58"/> were also persuaded and became disciples, and
            made confession in Christ, that He is the Son of the living God. But neither Abgar the
            king, nor Addai the Apostle pressed any man by force to believe in Christ; because
            without the force of man, the force of the signs compelled many to believe in Him. And
            all this country of Mesopotamia, and all the regions round about it received his
            doctrine with love.</p>
        <p>But Aggai made the chains <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n59"/> and headbands of the king, and
            Palut and Abshelama <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n60"/> and Barsamya with the rest of the
            others their companions, adhered to Addai the Apostle, and he received them and made
            them partakers with him in the ministry; they read in the Old 
            Testament<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n61"/> and the New, and the Prophets, and the Acts of the Apostles,
            every day they meditated on them. He commanded them cautiously, "Let your bodies be
            pure, and let your persons be holy; as is right for men who stand before the altar of
            God; and be ye indeed far<pb n="34"/> removed from
            false swearing, and from wicked murder, and from false testimony, which is mixed with
            adultery, and from sorcerers with respect to whom there are no mercies, and from
            divinations, and soothsaying, and necromancers, and from fates, and nativities, in which
            the erring Chaldees boast themselves; and from stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, in
            which the foolish are confident. And keep at a distance from you evil hypocrisy, and
            bribes, and gifts, by which the pure are condemned. And with this ministry to which ye
            have been called, let there not be for you another service; for the Lord Himself is the
            service of your ministry all the days of your life. Be ye also diligent to deliver the
            sign of baptism, and love ye not the gains of this world, but hearken ye to judgment
            with justice and truth. And be ye not a stumbling block to the blind, that the name of
            Him who opened the eyes of the blind, as we have seen, be not blasphemed through you.
            Let all, therefore, who see you, perceive that ye perform all which ye preach and teach.
            And they ministered with him in the church which Addai had built by the word and command
            of Abgar the king, and they were supplied from that which was the king's and his nobles;
            and some of them they brought for the house of God, and some for the nourishment of the
            poor. But a large multitude of people assembled day by day and came to the prayer of the
            service, and to <i>the reading </i>of the Old and New Testament, of the 
            Diatessaron,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n62"/> and they believed in the revival of the 
            dead, and<pb n="35"/> they buried their dead in the hope of the
            resurrection. They also observed the festivals of the Church in their times, and every
            day they were constant in the vigils of the Church, and they likewise performed acts of
            charity to the sick and those who were whole, according to the instruction of Addai to
            them. And in places round about the city churches were built, and the hand of the
            priesthood many received from him: So also orientals with the appearance of merchants
            passed into the country of the Romans to see the signs which Addai did, and those of
            them who became disciples, received from them <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n63"/> the hand
            of the priesthood, and in their own country of the Assyrians they taught the sons of
            their people, and houses of prayer they built there secretly, because of the danger
            arising from the worshippers of fire and the adorers of water.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n64"/>
       </p>
        <p>But Nersai,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n65"/> the king of the Assyrians, when he had heard
            of these things which Addai the Apostle had done, he sent to Abgar, the king; either
            send me the man who<pb n="36"/> hath done these signs
            with thee, that I may see him and hear his discourse, or send me <i>an account of
            </i>all these things which thou hast seen him do in thy city. And Abgar wrote to Nersai
            and made him acquainted with the whole history of the affair of Addai from the beginning
            to the end, and he left not any thing which he did not write to him.</p>
        <p>But when Nersai heard those things which were written to him, he wondered and was
            astonished. But Abgar the king, because that he was not able to pass to the country of
            the Romans, and to go to Palestine and slay the Jews, because that they had crucified
            Christ, wrote a letter and sent to Tiberius Caesar, writing it thus: "Abgar, the king,
            to our Lord Tiberius Caesar, peace. Knowing that not anything is hidden from thy
            Majesty, I write and inform thy dread and great sovereignty, that the Jews, who are
            under thy hand, who dwell in the country of Palestine, assembled themselves together and
            crucified the Christ without any fault <i>worthy </i>of death, when he was doing before
            them signs and wonders, and showed them mighty works and signs; 
            so<pb n="37"/> that even the dead He raised to life for them. And at
            the time they crucified Him, the sun became darkened and the earth shook, and all
            creatures trembled, and as if of themselves, at this deed all creation quailed, and its
            inhabitants. And now thy majesty knows what is right to command against the people of
            the Jews, who did these things."</p>
        <p>And Tiberius Caesar wrote and sent to Abgar the king, and thus he wrote to him: "The
            letter of thy fidelity to me, I have received, and it was read before me. With respect
            to that which the Jews have done with the cross, Pilate the governor hath also written,
            and informed Olbinus, <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n66"/> my pro-consul, of these things
            which thou hast written to me. But because of the war of the Spaniards who have rebelled
            against me is going on at this time, therefore I have not been able to avenge this
            matter; but I am prepared, when I have quietness, to make a charge legally against the
            Jews, who have not acted legally. And because of this, as to Pilate, who was made by me
            governor there, I have sent another in his place, and I have dismissed him with
            disgrace, because that he departed from the law, and did the will of the Jews, and he
            crucified Christ for the gratification of the Jews, who according to that which I hear
            of them, instead of the cross of death, it was fitting that He should be honoured, and
            it was right He should be worshipped by them, especially as they saw with their eyes all
            which He did. But thou, according to thy fidelity to me and thy 
            true<pb n="38"/> compact and that of thy fathers, hast done well to
            write to me thus."</p>
        <p>And Abgar the king, received Aristides,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n67"/> who was sent to
            him by Tiberius Caesar, and he replied, sent him back with honourable gifts, which were
            suitable for him, who had sent him to him. And he departed from Edessa, and went to
                Ticnutha,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n68"/> where was Claudius the second, from the
            king, and from there also he went to Artica,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n69"/> where was
            Tiberius Caesar. But Gaius guarded the regions, which were round about the Emperor. And
            Aristides himself also recounted before Tiberius the mighty works which Addai did before
            Abgar the king. And when he had rest from the war, he sent, slew some of the chiefs of
            the Jews, who were in Palestine. And when Abgar the king heard, he greatly rejoiced at
            this, that the Jews had received punishment, as it was right.</p>
        <p>And some years after Addai the Apostle had built the church in Edessa, and furnished it
            with everything which was suitable for it, and had taught many of the population of the
            city, also in the other villages, both those which were distant, and those which were
            near, he built churches, and completed and ornamented <i>them, </i>and appointed in them
            deacons and elders, and<pb n="39"/> taught in them
            those who should read the Scriptures, and the orders of the ministry within and without
            he taught. After all these things he became ill with the disease, by which he departed
            from this world.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n70"/> And he called Aggai before all the
            congregation of the church, and he brought him near, and made him governor and ruler in
            his place. And concerning Palut, who was a deacon, he made him an elder, and of
            Abshelama, who was a scribe, he made him a deacon. And when the nobles and chiefs were
            assembled and stood by him, Bar-kalba and <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n71"/> Bar-Zati, and
            Marihab, the son of Barshemesh, and Sennac, son of Avida, and Peroz, son of Patricius,
            with the rest of their companions, Addai the Apostle said to them: "Ye know, and ye
            testify, all of you who hear me, that everything which I have preached to you and taught
            you, and ye have heard from me, so have I conducted myself among you, and ye have seen
            also in works, because that thus our Lord commanded us that whatsoever we preach in
            words before the people, we in work should do before every man. And according to the
            ordinances and laws which were appointed in Jerusalem, and by which also the Apostles,
            my companions, were governed,<pb n="40"/> so also ye,
            do not turn aside from them, and do not take away anything from them, as I myself also
            have been guided by them among you, and have not turned aside from them to the right
            hand, or to the left, that I might not become strange to the promised salvation, which
            is reserved for those who are guided by them. Take heed, therefore, to this ministry
            which ye hold, and with fear and trembling abide ye in it, and minister every day.
            Minister not in it with habits bringing contempt, but with the prudence of faith; and
            the praises of Christ, let them not cease from your mouth, and let not weariness in
            prayer at the <i>stated </i>times draw near to you. Take heed to the truth, which ye
            hold, and to the teaching of the truth, which ye have received, and to the inheritance
            of salvation, which I commend to you, because before the judgment-seat of Christ you
            will be sought out by Him, when He taketh account with the pastors and superiors, and
            when He taketh His money from merchants with the increase of gains. For He is the king's
            son, and goes to receive a kingdom, and to return, and to come and make a resurrection
            for all men; and then He sitteth on the throne of righteousness, and judgeth the dead
            and the living, as He hath said to us. Let not the secret eye of your mind from the
            height above be closed, that your offences may not multiply in the way in which there
            are no offences; nor abominable error in its ways. Seek ye those that are lost, and
            visit those that err, and rejoice ye in those that are found. Bind up those that are
            bruised, and be ye watchful of the fatlings, because at your hands will the sheep of
            Christ be required. Look ye not to passing honour, for the shepherd that looketh to be
            honoured by his flock, badly, badly with respect to him does his flock stand. Let your
            solicitude for the<pb n="41"/> young lambs be great,
            for their angels <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n72"/> behold the face of the invisible
            Father, and be ye not a stone of stumbling before the blind, but 
            clearers<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n73"/> of the way and the path in a difficult country, among the
            Jews, the crucifiers, and the erring heathen; for with these two parties only is there
            war for you, in order to show the truth of the faith, which ye hold; also when ye are
            quiet, your modest and honourable appearance will be fighting for you with those who
            hate truth and love falsehood. Be ye not smiters of the poor before the rich, for the
            severe infliction of their poverty is sufficient for them. Be ye not beguiled with the
            hateful cogitations of Satan, that ye be not stripped naked of the faith that ye have
            put on,<sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n74"/>
            </sup>for unbelief is easier than faith, as sin is easier than righteousness. Take heed,
            therefore, of those that crucified, that ye be not friends to them, that ye be not
            responsible with them whose hands are full of the blood of Christ; and ye know, and ye
            bear witness, that everything which we say and teach of the history of Christ, is
            written in the Book of the Prophets, and deposited with them. And their words bear
            witness to our teaching concerning the judgment, and suffering, and resurrection, and
            ascension of Christ; but they know not, that when they rise against us they rise against
            the words of the Prophets, and as in their lives they persecuted the Prophets, so also
            now, since their death, they persecute the truth, which is written in the Prophets.
            Again, take ye heed of the heathen, who worship the sun and the moon, and Bel and Nebo,
            and the rest of those which they call gods, though they are not gods in their 
            nature.<pb n="42"/> Flee ye, therefore, from them, because
            that they worship creatures and things made. And as reported to you before, the whole
            object <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n75"/> for which our Lord came into the world was that
            creatures might not again be worshipped and honoured, because they exist by the nod of
            their Creator; and when He wishes, He dissolves and makes them cease, and they are as
            though they are not. For the will of Him, who created the creatures, freed men from the
            yoke of the paganism of the creatures. For ye know that every one who worships the
            servants of a king with the king, the death of the sword findeth him in his worship. Be
            ye not searching for secret things, and inquiring after hidden things, which are written
            in the holy books that ye possess. Be ye not judges concerning the words of the
            Prophets. Remember and consider that by the Spirit of God they are said; and he who
            accuses the Prophets, accuses and judges the Spirit of God. May this be far from you I
            Because the ways of the Lord are straight, and the righteous walk in them without
            stumbling; but the infidels stumble in them; because that they have not the secret eye
            of the secret mind, which has no need of questions in which there is no profit, but
                loss.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n76"/> Remember the menacing judgment of the Prophets,
            and the word of our Lord, which defines their words, that the Lord judgeth by fire, and
            all men are tried by it. Wherefore, as wayfarers<pb n="43"/> and sojourners, 
            who tarry for a night and return early to their
            homes, so may you yourselves consider concerning this world, that from here ye go forth
            to the places where the Son went to prepare for every one worthy of them. As to kings of
            countries, their armies go forth before them, and prepare for them a dwelling-house for
            their honour; but this King of ours, behold, He is gone to prepare for His worshippers
            blessed mansions <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n77"/> in which they may dwell. For it was not
            in vain God created the children of men; but that they might worship and glorify Him.
            here and there for ever. As He passeth not away, so those glorifying Him cease not.
            Wherefore my death also, with the disease of which I am bound and lie; as a sleep of the
            night, let it be esteemed in your eyes. And remember that with the suffering of the Son,
            Death, which snatches away the children of men, passed away and ceased; and Satan, who
            causes many to sin and makes war with the true, that they may be without truth. And as a
            husbandman who puts his hand to the ploughshare, if he looks 
            behind,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n78"/> the furrows before him cannot be straight; so also ye who
            have been called to this gift of the ministry, be ye cautious, that ye do not trouble
                <i>yourselves </i>with the things of this world, lest by chance ye be impeded as to
            that to which ye have been called.</p>
        <p>As to princes and judges, who have embraced this faith, be ye loving them, although do
            not simulate in any thing, and if they sin, ye reprove them with justice. Ye shall show
            them openly your rectitude, that they may be corrected so as not again to conduct
            themselves after their own will. This solicitude ye shall have all the 
            days<pb n="44"/> of your life, that all of you may run
            after honest things, as ye also counsel others with respect to them; for in these things
            men find their life before God.</p>
        <p>But the Law,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n79"/> and the Prophets, and the Gospel, which ye
            read every day before the people, and the Epistles of Paul, which Simon Peter sent us
            from the city of Rome, and the Acts of the twelve Apostles, which John, the son of
            Zebedee, sent us from Ephesus; these Books read ye in the churches of Christ, and with
            these read not any others, as there is not any other in which the truth that ye hold is
            written, except these books, which retain you in the faith to which ye have been called.
            And our lord Abgar the king, and his honoured nobles, who have heard that which I have
            spoken before you to day are sufficient to be for me witnesses after my death, that I
            have diligently preached the doctrine of our Lord before every man, and that I have not
            acquired anything with His word in the world. For His word by which I have become rich
            was sufficient for me, and I have made by it many rich; for it lifts me up in this way
            in which I go forth before Christ, who has sent after me, that I should go by it to Him.
            For ye know that which I have said to you, "That all the souls of men, which depart from
            this body, die not; but they live and rise, and have mansions, and a dwelling-place of
            rest,<pb n="45"/> for the understanding and the
            intelligence of the soul do not cease, because the image of God is represented in it,
            which dieth not. For it is not as the body without feeling which perceives not the
            odious corruption which has come upon it. Eeward and recompense it is not able to
            receive without it (<i>the body</i>); because that labour was not its only, but also of
            the body in which it dwelt. But the rebellious who know not God, they become penitent
            then to no purpose. Ye, indeed, who are of Christ, whose glorious name is placed upon
            you, and ruleth, He will direct you in the way of truth, in which, ye shall go and shall
            arrive at and attain to that which is promised and kept for those who depart not from
            Him; but abide according to what they were called to by our Lord.</p>
        <p>And when Addai the Apostle had said this word, he ceased and was silent. And Aggai,
            maker of the king's chains, and Palut, and Abshelama, with the rest of their companions,
            answered and said to Addai the Apostle, "Christ Himself has testified that He sent thee
            to us, and thou hast taught us the true faith, and hast made us possess the true life.
            As we have heard from thee and received, all this time thou hast been with us, so we
            abide all the days of our life. And from the worship of things made and created, which
            our fathers worshipped, we flee, and with <sup><ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n80"/>
            </sup>the Jews, the crucifiers we will not mix ourselves; and this inheritance, which we
            have received from thee, we do not let go, but with it we will depart from this world.
            And in the day of our Lord, before the judgment-seat of righteousness, there will He
            return to us this inheritance as that thou hast said to us.</p>
        <p>And when these things had been said, Abgar the king,<pb n="46"/> arose, he 
            and his princes, and all the nobles of his kingdom,
            and he went to his own palace, when all of them grieved over him, for he was dying. And
            he sent to him honourable and costly garments, in which he should be buried; and when
            Addai saw them, he sent word to him, that not in my life have I taken from thee
            anything, and I will not falsify in me the word of Christ, which He said to me, "Receive
            not anything from man, arid acquire not anything in this 
            world."<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n81"/> And after three other days, that these things were said by
            Addai the Apostle, and he had heard and received the testimony of the doctrine of his
            preaching from the sons of his ministry, before all the nobles, he departed from this
            world, and it was the fifth day of the week, in the fourteenth of the month 
            Eyor.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n82"/> And the whole city was in great sorrow and bitter pain;
            not only Christians sorrowed for Him, but also Jews and Pagans, who were in this city.
            But king Abgar more than any man sorrowed for him, he and the princes of his kingdom.
            And in the grief of his<pb n="47"/> mind he despised
            and forsook the honour of his kingdom on that day; and with mournful tears he wept over
            him with every man. And all the people of the city, who saw him, wondered at how much he
            suffered because of him. And with great and excellent honour he carried and buried him,
            as one of the princes, when he dies, and he placed him in a great sepulchre of
            ornamental sculpture, in which those of the house of Aryu, the ancestors of the father
            of king Abgar, were placed. There he placed him carefully with grief and great sorrow.
            And all the people of the church went from time to time, and prayed there diligently,
            and the commemoration of his death they made from year to year, according to the command
            and instruction which was received by them from Addai the Apostle, and according to the
            word of Aggai, who was himself the guide and ruler and the successor of his chair after
            him, by the hand of the priesthood, which he had received from him before every man.</p>
        <p>And he also by the hand from which he received made priests and guides in all this
            country of Mesopotamia. For they also, as of Addai the Apostle, thus took his word and
            heard and received, as a good and faithful heir of the Apostle of the adorable Christ.
            But silver and gold he took not from man, and the gifts of the princes approached him
            not. For instead of gold and silver he enriched the Church of Christ with the souls of
            the faithful. But all the chiefs <ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n83"/> of men and 
            women<pb n="48"/> were modest and decorous, and they were
            holy and pure, and they dwelt singly and modestly without spot, in watchfulness of the
            ministry decorously, in their carefulness for the poor, in their visitations to the
            sick; for their goings forth were full of praise from those who saw, and their
            conversation was covered with glory from strangers; so that even the priests of the
            temple of Nebo and Bel divided with them the honour at all times, by their honourable
            aspect, by their truthful discourse, by the confidence which they possessed, and by
            their freedom, which was not enslaved to greediness, and was not in bondage under blame.
            For every one who saw them ran to meet them, that he might honourably salute them;
            because even the sight of them spread peace over the beholders. For their words of peace
            were spread like nets over the rebellious, when they were entering the fold of truth and
            verity. For there was no man who saw them, and was ashamed of them; because they did not
            anything which was not just, and which was not becoming, and in consequence of this
            their countenances were open in the preaching of their doctrine to every man. For
            whatsoever they said to others and directed them, they exhibited the same by works in
            themselves; and as to the hearers, who saw that their works were with their words, many
            became their disciples without persuasion, and confessed Christ the king, praising God
            who had turned them to Him.</p>
        <p>And years after the death of Abgar the king, one of<pb n="49"/> his rebellious 
            sons,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n84"/> who was not
            obedient to the truth, arose and sent word to Aggai, when he was sitting in the Church:
            "Make me headbands of gold, according to that which thou didst make for my fathers of
            old." Aggai sent him word: "I desert not the ministry of Christ, which has been
            committed to me by the disciple of Christ, and make headbands of 
            wickedness."<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n85"/> And when he saw that he did not obey him, he sent, and
            broke his legs, as he was sitting in the church and expounding. And as he was dying he
            made Palut and Abshelama swear that in this house, for the sake of whose name, behold, I
            die, place me and bury me. And as he made them swear, so they placed him within the
            middle door of the church, between the men and the women. And there was great and bitter
            sorrow in all the church, and in all the city, above the pain of sorrow, which had 
            been<pb n="50"/> in its interior, as the sorrow, which
            had been when Addai the Apostle died.</p>
        <p>And because that by the breaking of his legs he died suddenly and quickly, he was not
            able to place the hand upon Palut.<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n86"/> Palut himself went to
            Antioch, and received the hand of the priesthood from Serapion, Bishop of Antioch.
            Serapion, Bishop of Antioch, himself also received the hand from Zephyrinus, Bishop of
            the city of Rome,<ptr type="noteAnchor" ref="#n87"/> from the succession of the hand of the
            priesthood of Simon Cephas, which he received from our Lord, who was there Bishop of
            Rome twenty-five years, in the days of the Caesar, who reigned there thirteen years.</p>
        <p>And as is the custom in the kingdom of Abgar the king, and in all kingdoms, that
            everything which the king commands, and everything that is said before him is written
            down and placed among the records, so also Labubna, the son of Sennac, the son of
            Abshadar, the king's scribe, wrote these things of Addai the Apostle, from the beginning
            to the end. Hannan also, the Tabularius, the king's Sharrir, set the hand of witness,
            and placed it among the records of the writings of the kings, where are put the commands
            and laws, and <i>the contracts </i>of those who buy and sell are kept there with care,
            without any negligence.#nbsp#</p>

            is speaking in the context in the plural number, viz. "the Prophets of old."</note>
        <note xml:id="n34"> The sense seems to require Dolath instead of Vau,

            worshipped in other places. In Isaiah xlvi. 1, we read that "Nebo stoopeth." It is
            supposed that at Dibon, a city of Moab, was a temple to Nebo. See Selden, "De Diis

            Addai, have been an object of worship distinct from Bel. The worshippers of Bel
            attributed to him the gift of healing diseases, and asserted that he ate and drank. See

            Moses of Chorene, translated from the Armenian into French by P. E. le Vaillant de
            Florival, liv. ii. c. 27, this goddess is called Pathincagh. One has not heard of a god
            called <i>Nical, </i>and therefore it may be inferred that Bath Nical was a goddess
            invested with the attribute or attributes implied in the word [Syriac]. The sense of
            this word, however, is uncertain. The root has been supposed to be the Hebrew [Hebrew]
                '<i>He was able.</i>'<i> </i>If this be correct, the distinguishing attribute of
            this goddess would accordingly be <i>power. </i>It has also been suggested that,

            <i>Taratha. </i>Jacob of Serug, see Assemani, Bibliotheca Orient. I. 327, mentions this
            goddess with others, viz. Nebo, Bel, Sin, Bel-shemin, Bar-Nemre, Gadlat, &amp;c. It is
            thought that Taratha, or Atargatis as she was also called, is considered to have been a
            correlative of Dagon. Diodorus Siculus says (lib. ii.) that at Askelon the goddess
            Derceto or Atargatis was worshipped under the figure of a woman with the lower parts of
            a fish. (See Calmet's Dictionary of the Bible, under Dagon.) Assemani, in a note at the
            foot of the page cited above, says: "Tarata, Janus fortasse Syrorum nam <i>Tara </i>est
            Janua, unde faemininum <i>Tarata, </i>quod faeminae specie illud idolum colerent. See
            the discourse of Jacob of Serug, on the Fall of the Idols, published by M. l'Abbé
            Martin, in the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental Society, note and translation, p. 131,
            for the year 1875. These four divinities, in Whiston's Latin translation of Moses of
            Chorene, are Nabogus, Belus, Bathnicalus and Tharatha.</note>

            Lord to Abgar. See p. 5. The passage in this message seems to have given rise to the
            notion very prevalent and mentioned by several Syriac writers, that Edessa would be
            henceforth free from hostile invasion and be especially blessed and protected by God.</note>

            <i> Headlands, </i>According to our Syriac text [Syriac] of [Syriac] has no point to
            show whether it be a Dolath or a Resh. In Cureton's text it is a Dolath, but elsewhere
            we find it a Resh. As to the meaning of the word, see Dr. Payne Smith's note, cited by
            Pratten, Syr. Documents, p. 22.</note>
        <note xml:id="n56">
            <i>Piroz. </i>According to Cureton, this is supposed to be the same name as that of

        <note xml:id="n58">
            <i>Silks. </i>So the Syriac word is translated by Cureton. In Luke vii. 25, we have
            [Syriac] rendered by <i>soft raiment. </i>See also Matt. xi. 8. It is probable from what
            is here said and referred to by other writers, that the Jews of Edessa carried on an
            extensive trade with people of other districts and countries.</note>
        <note xml:id="n59"> The word [Syriac] is by some translated <i>chains,
            </i>and by others <i>silks </i>or <i>muslins. </i>The former rendering is adopted by
            Castle, and the latter by Moses of Chorene, and although the word is translated
                <i>chains </i>by Dr. Cureton in a note p. 157, he seems to think it might be more
            correctly rendered <i>silks. </i>I prefer the former rendering, because in Numb. xxxi.
            50, and Isaiah iii. 22, the former but not the latter will suit the context.</note>

        <note xml:id="n61"> As the Prophets are mentioned by themselves, the
            Old Testament here probably means no more than the Pentateuch. Similarly, as the Acts of
            the Apostles are named apart from the New Testament, the latter is probably intended to
            comprise only the Gospels.</note>
        <note xml:id="n62">
            <i>Diatessaron. </i>In the text of Cureton is <i>Ditornon. </i>The reading of the MS.,
            he remarks, is not quite clear, and he is disposed to think that the word ought to be
                <i>Diatessaron. </i>The reading of the St. Petersburgh MS., as we see, confirms Dr.
            Cureton's supposition. The Diatessaron was that made by Tatian, and was, as appears from
            sundry</note>
        <p>testimonies, in general use in the Syrian churches in the second century. It was a
            volume compiled from the Four Gospels, and seems to have been publicly read at Edessa up
            to the fourth century. Mention is<sub> </sub>made of it in Asseman. Bibl. Orient, tom.
            iii. p. 12: <i>The Gospel which Tatian compiled, and he called it the Diatessaron, </i>A
            commentary was written on this work by Ephraim Syrus, according to what is affirmed by
            Barsalibe and Bar Hebraeus as recorded in Asseman. Bibl. Orient, tom. I. pp. 57, 58. The
            former says that Ephraim illustrated the Diatessaron with commentaries; and the latter,
            in speaking of Tatian's volume, in his work [Syriac], says that the expression "In the
            beginning was the word "was elucidated by Ephraim.#nbsp#</p>

            Arméniens, à mon fils Narseh, salut; J'ai reçu ta lettre et tes hommages; j'ai déchargé
            Béroze de ses fers, et lui ai remis ses offenses, si cela te fait plaisir, donne lui le

            des miracles et prêche un autre Dieu supérieur au feu et à l'eau, afin que tu puisses le
            voir et l'entendre, je te dirai: Ce n'était point un médecin selon l'art des hommes,
            c'était un disciple du fils de Dieu, créateur du feu et de l'eau, il a été destiné,
            envoyé aux contrées de l'Arménie. Mais un de ses principaux compagnons, nommé Simon, est

            <i>Olbinus. </i>It is the opinion of Cureton that this name has been confounded with
            that of Albinus, who was made governor of Judaea by Nero, A.D. 62. No person of the name
            of Olbinus was governor of Judaea at the time mentioned in the document, and the opinion
            referred to is most probably correct, and the mistake arose from some confusion of the
            editor.</note>
        <note xml:id="n67">
            <i>Aristides. </i>In the Armenian version, this name is written <i>Artidias, </i>which

            p. 45.</note>
        <note xml:id="n69">
            <i>Artica. </i>This word may, by placing different vowels to it, be pronounced
                <i>Ortyka, </i>which Cureton thinks was intended for <i>Ortygia, </i>near to
            Syracuse, not far distant from Capreae, where Tiberius resided.</note>
        <note xml:id="n70"> A great difference is found here between the Syriac
            text and the Armenian version. According to the former, Addai had gathered around him
            the nobles and chiefs, in order that he might deliver unto them his farewell and dying
            discourse, but in the latter it is said that "the Apostle Addai conceived the thought of
            visiting the countries of the East and Assyria to preach there," &amp;c. One statement
            must be erroneous, and authority obliges us to conclude that the error is in the
            Armenian version.</note>
        <note xml:id="n71">
            <i>And. </i>We have a <i>vau </i>in our MS. which is not in Cureton's text, nor is it
            supported by the Armenian version; we think, therefore, that the reading should be, not
                <i>Bar-Kalba and Bar-Zati, </i>but <i>Bar Kalba, son of Zati.</i>

            the whole object for which our Lord came into the world was that creatures might not

            and the New of the Diatessaron, p. 34. Here we have the Holy Scriptures more
            particularly specified. The New Testament is described as consisting of the Gospel, the
            Epistles of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles. The two latter were probably not written
            at the time that Addai was preaching Christianity in Edessa. If the Gospel mentioned be
            that of St. Matthew, that might possibly have been then in existence.</note>
        <note xml:id="n80"> Here Cureton's text recommences.</note>
        <note xml:id="n81"> These words are not according to the letter, but
            are certainly in the spirit of the instructions, which our Lord delivered to the twelve
            disciples at their ordination, as we read them in Matt. x. 7-10. Anything like desire or
            anxiety for the things of this world, the disciples of Christ were frequently and in
            distinct and impressive language warned against by their Master.</note>
        <note xml:id="n82"> Eyor is the Syriac word for the month of May. In
            Assemani, Bibl. Orient. tom. ii. p. 392, we find it stated, on the authority of Bar
            Hebraeus, "that Addai the Apostle was slain on the 30th of July, and buried in the
            church, which he himself had built in Edessa." This date, however, is contradicted in a
            foot-note on the same page, in the following terms:----"Amrus Matthaei filius historicus
            Nestorianus, qui Chronicon Maris ejusdem sectae scriptoris in compendium redegit,
            Addaeum obiise refert, non die 30 Julii, sed 14 Maii. Et quidem in pervetusto Kalendario
            Syriaco, quod ad calcem Codicis 32 in fine hujus tomi subjicitur, die Maii 14, Addaeus
            decessisse dicitur."</note>
        <note xml:id="n83">
            <i>Chiefs. </i>This is the rendering in the Armenian version, and it seems to me that it
            is a sense in accordance with the Syriac text. The Syriac noun, among other meanings,
            signifies a <i>prefect </i>or <i>chief. Every chief </i>is the same as <i>all the
                chiefs, </i>and so the noun may agree with the plural number of the verb in the
            text. The expression thus considered refers to the most distinguished persons of both
            sexes. Cureton states that it alludes to those who especially belonged to the ministry
            of the church.</note>
        <note xml:id="n84"> It appears that this rebellious son did not reign
            till years after the death of Abgar. There must consequently have been another, who was
            the immediate successor of Abgar; and the name of this successor was Ma'nu, who is said
            to have reigned seven years, according to what is stated by Assemani, Bibl. Orient, tom.
            i. p. 421. The successor of Ma'nu was his brother, also by name Ma'nu, and he reigned
            fourteen years. Moses of Chorene, liv. II. ch. xxxiv., says of this prince: "Il ouvrit
            les temples des idoles, embrassa le culte des païens. Il envoie dire à Attée, 'Fais moi
            une coiffure en toile tissée d'or, comme celles que tu faisais autrefois pour mon père.'
            Il reçut cette réponse d'Attée: 'Mes mains ne feront point de coiffure pour un prince
            indigne, qui n' adore pas le Christ Dieu vivant.' Aussitôt, le roi d'ordonner à un de
            ses gens d'armes de couper les pieds à Attée. Le soldat étant allé et ayant vu le saint
            personnage assis dans la chaire doctorale, avec son glaive lui coupa les jambes, et
            aussitôt le saint rendit l'esprit."</note>
        <note xml:id="n85">
            <i>Wickedness. </i>In Cureton's text the word is in the singular number.</note>
        <note xml:id="n86"> In p. 39, it is said that Addai made Palut an Elder.
            It would seem, therefore, that this whole paragraph, as Cureton observes, must have been
            introduced into the text at a later period, and that too by some careless, ignorant
            person.</note>
        <note xml:id="n87"> In Cureton's text the word is <i>Rome, </i>which is
            right. The name found in our MS. is obviously a mistake.</note>
