                 Syro-Macedonians, coincides, says Assemani, with B.C. 129. Dionysius places the
                 commencement of the Edessene kingdom in B.C. 136, or, as he calls it, in the year of
                 Abraham 1880.----"The year 1880 of Abraham, there began to reign over Edessa (Urhoi) the
                 first King Orhoi, son of Hevia, five years, and after his name it was called Urhoi." No
                 great antiquity is ascribed to the name of the city by this version of its story.</note>

              <p>In the year 400 Abgar the king built a mausoleum for himself.</p>
              <note>The Syriac is remarkable. Abgar "built 
                 a <hi rend="italic">naphsho</hi> in  honour of his death." The 
                 word <hi rend="italic">naphsho</hi>  is usually translated "soul," or " self," but 
                 is said sometimes to denote a sepulchre or mausoleum. Perhaps the word should 
                 be <hi rend="italic">nauso</hi>, a shrine or temple. Assemani says this 
                 Abgar was Abgar Bar Ajazat, the nineteenth King of Edessa. Bayer thinks he 
                 was old when he began to reign, because he built a mausoleum 
                 for himself. <title>Bibl. Or.</title>, i., 421; Bayer, <title>Hist. Osrhoena</title>,

                 flourished in the year 479. If he were only born in 465 (A.D. 154) this can hardly be

              <p> 8. In the year 513, in the reign of Severus, and in the reign of Abgar the king, son of
                 Maano the king, in the month Tishrin the latter (<abbr>i.e.,</abbr>, November), the fountain
                 of water which proceeds from the great palace of Abgar the great king increased, and it
                 prevailed, and it went up according to its former manner, and overflowed and ran out on
                 all sides, so that the courts and the porches and the royal houses began to be filled
                 with water. And when our lord Abgar the king saw it, he went up to the level ground on
                 the hill above his palace, where dwell and reside those who do the work for the
                 government. And while the wise men considered what to do to the waters which had so
                 greatly increased, it happened that there was a great and violent rain in the night, and
                 the Daisan (river) came, neither in its day, nor in its month. And strange waters came;
                 and they encountered the <hi rend="italics">cataracts</hi>(? flood gates) which were fastened with great
                 pieces of iron which were overlaid upon them, and with bars of iron which supported
                 them. But not prevailing against them, the waters rose like a great sea beyond the walls
                 of the city. And the waters began to come down from the apertures of the wall into the
                 city. And Abgar the king stood on the great tower which was called that of the Persians,
                 and saw the water by the light of torches, and he commanded, and they took away the
                 gates and the eight <hi rend="italics">cataracts</hi>(? flood-gates) of the western wall of the city
                 where the river flowed out. But that very hour the waters broke down the western wall of
                 the city, and entered the city, and overthrew the great and beautiful palace of our lord
                 the king, and they carried away everything that was found before them, the desirable and
                 beautiful edifices of the city, whatever <pb n="31"/>
                 was near the river on the south and on the north of it. And they destroyed the temple of
                 the church of the Christians. And there were killed by that occurrence more than two
                 thousand men, upon many of whom as they slept in the night the waters came suddenly, and
                 they were drowned, and the city was filled with the sound of lamentation.</p>
              <p> And when Abgar the king saw this destruction which had befallen, he commanded that all
                 the craftsmen of the city should remove their cottages (or huts) from near the river,
                 and that no man should build near the river any cottage. And by the wisdom of measurers
                 and men of skill the cottages were placed so that the breadth of the river might be
                 increased, and they added to its former measure. For if the waters were many and strong,
                 the width of the river was too small to receive the water of twenty-five brooks with
                 what they gathered from all sides. And Abgar the king commanded that all who lived in
                 the porch, and were occupied over against the river, from Tishrin the former to Nisan
                 (October to April), should not lodge in their cottages, except the islanders (Gazireans)
                 who kept the city, five of whom should lodge on the wall above the place where the
                 waters entered the city all the time of winter, and when they perceived by night and
                 heard the sound of strange waters, which began to enter the city, and whoever heard the
                 sound and neglected it, and did not publish it, behold the waters should drown the
                 contempt of him that despised the command of the king. And this commandment was decreed
                 from this time wherein it was so to the end of the world.</p>
              <p> Our lord Abgar the king commanded, and there was built for him a building for his royal
                 house----a winter house at Tabara ----and there he dwelt all the time of winter; and in
                 summer he came down to the new palace which was built for him at the fountain head. And
                 his nobles also built for themselves buildings to live in, in the neighbourhood in which
                 the king was, in the high street (?) which is called Beth Saharoye. And in order to
                 restore the welfare of the former city, Abgar the king commanded, and the tributes due
                 from those within, and from those who dwelt in towns, and in hamlets, were remitted: and
                 tribute was not demanded from them for five years, until the city was enriched with men,
                 and was crowned with buildings.</p>
              <p> Now Mar Yahab Bar Shemesh, and Kajuma Bar Magartat, the scribes of Edessa, recorded this
                 event, and the command of Abgar the king: and Bar Din and Bulid, who are prefects over
                 the archives of Edessa, received and deposited it within them as trusted of the city
                 (<abbr>i.e.,</abbr>, archivists.) <pb n="32"/>#nbsp.</p>

                 also built a "nosocomium pauperum invalidorum extra portam Beth-Semes." The Syriac is
                 here peculiar, and might be rendered "the field of the house of poor invalids."

              <note type="section">This Chronicle is followed in Assemani by a list of the kings of Edessa, and a list
                 of its bishops from A.D. 313 to 769. We may note that the Chronicle mentions no Bishop
                 of Edessa before Conon, "who laid the foundation of the Church of Edessa" in A.D. 313.
                 But we must not misinterpret this indication. There had long been Christians in Edessa,
                 as authentic records prove. Not only so, this very Chronicle, in recording the overthrow
                 of the city by water in 513 (A.D. 202), mentions the destruction of the "temple of the
                 church of the Christians." This remarkable phrase shews not only that the disciples had
                 a house of worship then, but that it was called a temple. More than this, the Christian
                 community seems to monopolize the word Church, which was not yet applied to the building
                 in which they assembled. Assemani observes that the words under notice shew that the
                 Archivists were still heathen, although the king was a Christian, as Eusebius notes from
                 Africanus (in Chron). Conon, above-named, refounded the church at Edessa, and hoped to
                 rebuild it, but this work was accomplished by his successor. It can hardly be supposed
                 that the reference is to the restoration of the "temple" destroyed in A.D. 202; it is
                 rather to what is called "the old church" in number 60; restored by Justinian with
                 immense splendour.---- (Vid. Bayer, p. 250).</note>
