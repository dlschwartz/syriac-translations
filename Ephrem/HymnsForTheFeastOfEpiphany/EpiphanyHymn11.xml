            <ab>Response: Let the bodies rejoice which the Evil One had made naked, that in the
               water they have put on their glory!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>Give thanks, O daughter, that thy crownings have been doubled;—for lo! thy temples
               and thy sons rejoice.—The dedication of thy temples is in the ministration;—The
               dedication of thy sons is in the anointing.—Blessed art thou that at once……—……the
               tabernacle for them that dwell in thee,—and the Spirit has abode upon thy sons!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Our Lord opened up Baptism—in the midst of <placeName>Jordan</placeName> the blessed river.—The height and
               the depth rejoiced in Him;—He brings forth the first fruits of His peace from the
               water,—for they are first fruits, the fruits of Baptism.—The good God in His
               compassion will bring to pass—that His peace shall be first fruits on earth.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab><placeName>Moses</placeName> stretched out the temporal Tabernacle;—the priests bathed themselves in
               water,—and went in and ministered; and were stricken and punished,—because their
               heart within was not cleansed.—Blessed art thou that in the Passover of the great
               Passion,—the priests by the savour of their oblations,—lo! are cleansing souls in
               thee!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Great was the mystery that the Prophet saw,—the torrent that was mighty.—Into its
               depths he gazed and beheld—thy beauty instead of himself; thee it was he saw, for thy
               faith passes not away,—thou whose flood unseen shall overwhelm—the subtleties of
               idolatry.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Though <persName>John</persName> was great among them that are born of women,—yet he that is little is
               greater than he,—in this that his baptized were again baptized,—in the baptism that
               was of the Apostles.—Blessed art thou that thy priest is greater than he—in this
               alone that forever—abides his baptism.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The baptism that was of <placeName>Siloam</placeName>—did not bring mercy to the man that was laid
               there—who for thirty and eight years awaited it,—for he was a respecter of the
               persons of the Levites.—Blessed art thou that thy healing is in thee for all men,—and
               thy priests are devoted and ready—for all that are in need of thy help.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>The Prophet healed the waters that were unwholesome,—and cured the disease of the
               land that was barren,—so that its death was done away and its region resounded, for
               its offspring increased and its bosom was filled.—Greater is Thy grace, Lord, than
               <persName>Elisha</persName>’s!—Multiply my lambs and my flocks—at the great stream of my fountain!<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></ab>

         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Great is the marvel that is within thy abode;—the flocks together with the
               Shepherds,—those at the stream of the waters,—two unseen with one manifest who
               baptizes.—Blessed is he who is baptized in their fountains!—for three arms have
               upheld him,—and three Names have preserved him!</ab>
