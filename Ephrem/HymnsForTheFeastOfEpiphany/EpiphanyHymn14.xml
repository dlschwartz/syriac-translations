            <ab>My thought bore me to Jordan,—and I saw a marvel when there was revealed—the

            <ab>I saw John filled with wonder,—and the multitudes standing about him,—and the
               glorious Bridegroom bowed down—to the Son of the barren that he might baptize
               Him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>At the Word and the Voice my thought marvelled:—for lo! John was the Voice;—our Lord

         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>The Bride was espoused but knew not—who was the Bridegroom on whom she gazed:—the

               them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Then the Bridegroom revealed Himself;—and to John at the voice He drew near:—and the
               Forerunner was moved and said of Him—<quote>This is the Bridegroom Whom I
                  proclaimed.</quote></ab>

            <ab>He came to baptism Who baptizes all,—and He showed Himself at Jordan.—John saw Him

                  Thou that with Thy hyssop purifiest all.</quote></ab>

            <ab><quote>I have asked it, and it pleases Me that thus it should be;—and thou, John,

            <ab><quote>It becomes thee to know wherefore I am come,—and for what cause I have

            <ab><quote>Small is the river whereto Thou art come,—that Thou shouldst lodge therein

                  less shall Baptism contain Thee!</quote></ab>
