            <ab>Response: Happy are ye whose bodies have been made to shine!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>God in His mercy stooped and came down,—to mingle His compassion with the water,—and
               to blend the nature of His majesty—with the wretched bodies of men.—He made occasion
               by the water—to come down and to dwell in us:—like to the occasion of mercy—when He
               came down and dwelt in the womb:—O the mercies of God—Who seeks for Himself all
               occasions to dwell in us!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>To the cave in <placeName>Horeb</placeName> He stooped and came down,—and on <persName>Moses</persName> He caused His majesty to
               dwell;—He imparted His glorious splendour to mortals.—There was therein a figure of
               Baptism:—He Who came down and dwelt in it,—tempers within the water—the might of His
               majesty,—that He may dwell in the feeble.—On <persName>Moses</persName> dwelt the Breath,—and on you the
               Perfecting of Christ.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>That might then none could endure;—not <persName>Moses</persName> chief of deliverers,—nor <persName>Elijah</persName> chief
               of zealots;—and the Seraphin too vail their faces,—for it is the might that subdues
               all.—His mercy mingled gentleness—in the water and by the oil;—that mankind in its
               weakness—might be able to stand before Him—when covered by the water and the
               oil.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>The captive priests again in the well—hid and concealed the fire of the
               sanctuary,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/>—a mystery of that glorified fire—which the Highpriest mingles in
               Baptism.—The priests took up of the mire,—and on the altar they sprinkled it;—for its
               fire, the fire of that well,—with the mire had been mingled;—a mystery of our bodies
               which in the water—with the fire of the Holy Spirit have been mingled.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>The famous Three in <placeName>Babylon</placeName>—in the furnace of fire were baptized, and came
               forth;—they went in and bathed in the flood of flame, they were buffeted by the
               blazing billows.—There was sprinkled on them there—the dew that fell from heaven;—it
               loosed from off them there—the bonds of the earthly king.—Lo! the famous Three went
               in and found a fourth in the furnace.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>That visible fire that triumphed outwardly,—pointed to the fire of the Holy
               Ghost,—which is mingled, lo! and hidden in the water.—In the flame Baptism is
               figured,—in that blaze of the furnace.—Come, enter, be baptized, my brethren,—for lo!
               it looses the bonds;—for in it there dwells and is hidden—the Daysman of God,—Who in
               the furnace was the fourth.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Two words again our Lord spake—which in one voice agree in unison:—He said, <quote>I am
               come to send fire,</quote>—and again, <quote>I have a baptism to be baptized with.</quote>—By the fire of
               Baptism is quenched the fire,—that which the Evil One had kindled:—and the water of
               Baptism has overcome—those waters of contention—by which he had made trial—of <persName>Joseph</persName>
               who conquered and was crowned.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Lo! the pure fire of our Redeemer—which he kindled in mankind of His mercy!—Through
               His fire He quenched that fire—which had been kindled in the defiled and sinful.—This
               is the fire wherein the thorns—are burnt up and the tares.—But happy are your
               bodies—that have been baptized in the fire—which has consumed your thickets,—and by
               it your seeds have sprung up to heaven!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab><persName>Jeremiah</persName> in the womb He sanctified and taught.—But if the lowly bosom of wedlock—was
               sanctified in conceiving and bringing him forth,—how much more shall Baptism
               sanctify—its conception and its bringing forth—of them that are pure and
               spiritual!—For there, within the womb—is the conception of all men;—but here, out of
               the water,—is the birth whereof the spiritual are worthy.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>For <persName>Jeremiah</persName> though sanctified in the womb,—they took up nails and cast him into the
               pit.—Holy was the prophet in his befoulment,—for clean was his heart though he was in
               the mire.—Be ye afraid, my brethren—for lo! to-day is washed away—your secret
               befoulment,—and the abomination of your sins.—Turn not again to uncleanness,—for
               there is but one cleansing of your bodies!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>The presumptuous who is baptized and again sins,—is as the serpent that casts its
               slough and again puts it on, that is renewed and made young, and turns again——putting
               on anew its skin of old;—for the serpent does not—cast off its nature.—Cast ye off
               the tempter—the corrupter of souls,—even the old man;—let it not make old—the newness
               ye have put on!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab><persName>Elisha</persName> cast the wood into the water, and made the heavy float and the light
               sink:—their natures were exchanged in the water.—There a new thing came to pass not
               according to nature.—How much easier then, O Lord,—is this for Thy grace; that in the
               water should sink—transgression which is heavy,—but that the soul which is
               light—should be drawn forth and raised up on high!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab><persName>Joshua</persName>, son of <persName>Nun</persName>, on <placeName>Jericho</placeName>—laid a curse on its walls and a doom on its
               fountains.—They whom <persName>Joshua</persName> cursed to their destruction,—again in the mystery of
               <persName>Jesus</persName> have been blessed.—There was cast into them salt,—and they were healed and
               sweetened:—a mystery of this salt,—the sweet salt that came from <persName>Mary</persName>,—that was
               mingled in the water,—whereby was healed the noisomeness of our plagues.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Lo! quiet waters are before you,—holy and tranquil and pleasant;—for they are not
               the waters of contention—that cast <persName>Joseph</persName> into the dungeon;—nor yet are they the
               waters,—those waters of strife,—beside which the people strove,—and gainsaid in the
               wilderness.—There are waters whereby—there is reconciliation made with Heaven.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab><persName>Hagar</persName> saw the spring of water,—and from it she gave drink to her forward son, him
               who became as a wild ass in the wilderness.—Instead of that fountain of water is
               Baptism.—In it are baptized the sons of <persName>Hagar</persName>,—and are become gentle and peaceful.
               Who has seen rams<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> like these,—that are yoked, lo! and labour—along with tame
               bullocks,—and the seed of their tillage is reaped an hundredfold!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>In the beginning the Spirit that brooded—moved on the waters; they conceived and
               gave birth—to serpents and fishes and birds.—The Holy Spirit has brooded in
               Baptism,—and in mystery has given birth to eagles,—Virgins and Prelates;—and in
               mystery has given birth to fishes,—celibates and intercessors; and in mystery of
               serpents,—lo! the subtle have become simple as doves!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>Lo! the sword of our Lord in the waters!—that which divides sons and fathers:—for it
               is the living sword that makes—division, lo! of the living from the dying.—Lo! they
               are baptized and they become—Virgins and saints,—who have gone down, been baptized,
               and put on—the One Only begotten.—Lo! many have come boldly to Him!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>For whoso have been baptized and put on Him—the Only begotten the Lord of the
               many,—has filled thereby the place of many,—for to him Christ has become a great
               treasure:—for He became in the wilderness—a table of good meats,—and He became at the
               marriage feast—a fountain of choice wines.—He has become such to all in all
               things,—by helps and healings and promises.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab><persName>Elisha</persName> was the equal of the Watchers—in his doings, glorious and holy.—The camp of
               the Watchers was round about him;—thus let Baptism be unto you,—a camp of
               guardians,—for by means of it there dwells in the heart—the hope of them that are
               below—and the Lord of them that are above.—Sanctify for Him your bodies,—for where He
               abides, corruption comes not near.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>They are no more, the waters of that sea—which by its billows preserved the
               People,—and by its billows laid low the peoples.—Of contrary effect are the waters in
               Baptism.—In them, lo! the people have life;—in them, lo! the People perishes:—for all
               that are not baptized,—in the waters that give life to all,—they are dead
               invisibly.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>They are no more, the waters of that sea—which were tempestuous, and boiled against
               <persName>Jonah</persName>,—and plunged into the depths the Son of <persName>Amittai</persName>.—Though he fled he was bound in
               the prison-house;—God cast him in and bound him—in dungeon within dungeon;—for he
               bound him in the sea.—and He bound him in the fish.—For him Grace stood surety,—and
               she opened the prison and brought forth the preacher.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>The Prophets have called the Most High a fire,—<quote>a devouring fire,</quote> and <quote>who can
               dwell with it?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/>—The People were not able to dwell in it;—its might crushed the
               peoples and they were confounded.—In it, with the unction ye have been anointed;—ye
               have put Him on in the water;—in the bread ye have eaten Him;—in the wine ye have
               drunk Him;—in the voice ye have heard Him;—and in the eye of the mind ye have seen
               Him!</ab>
