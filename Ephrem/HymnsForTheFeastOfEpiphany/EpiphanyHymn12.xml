            <ab>Response: Blessed is He Who went down and was baptized in <placeName>Jordan</placeName>, and turned back
               the People from error!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>In Baptism <persName>Adam</persName> found again—that glory that was among the trees of <placeName>Eden</placeName>.—He went
               down, and received it out of the water;—he put it on, and went up and was adorned
               therein.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Man fell in the midst of Paradise,—and in baptism compassion restored him:—he lost
               his comeliness through <persName>Satan</persName>’s envy,—and found it again by God’s grace.—Blessed be He
               that has mercy on all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>The wedded pair were adorned in <placeName>Eden</placeName>;—but the serpent stole their crowns:—yet mercy
               crushed down the accursed one,—and made the wedded pair goodly in their
               raiment.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</ab>

         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>They clothed themselves with leaves of necessity;—but the Merciful had pity on their
               beauty,—and instead of leaves of trees,—He clothed them with glory in the
               water.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Baptism is the well-spring of life,—which the Son of God opened by His Life;—and
               from His Side it has brought forth streams.—Come, all that thirst, come,
               rejoice!—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The Father has sealed Baptism, to exalt it;—and the Son has espoused it to glorify
               it;—and the Spirit with threefold seal—has stamped it, and it has shone in
               holiness.—Blessed be He that has mercy on all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>The Trinity that is unsearchable—has laid up treasures in baptism.—Descend, ye poor,
               to its fountain!—and be enriched from it, ye needy!—Blessed be He that has mercy on
               all!</ab>
