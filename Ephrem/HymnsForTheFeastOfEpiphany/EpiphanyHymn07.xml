            <ab>Response: Blessed is He Who atoned your sins, that ye might receive His Body
               worthily!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>The flock of <persName>Jacob</persName> came down—and stood round the well of water.—In the water they
               put on the similitude of the wood that was covered by it.—Mysteries these and types
               of the Cross,—wherein the parables are interpreted.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>There are shown in these rods similitudes,—and in the sheep, parables.—The Cross in
               the rods is figured, and in the sheep the souls of men.—His wood was a mystery of our
               Wood;—likewise his sheep a mystery of our flock.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>The sheep of Christ rejoice,—and stand round the laver of baptism;—in the water they
               put on the likeness—of the living and goodly Cross—whereon gaze all things
               created,—and all of it is stamped on them all.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>At the well <persName>Rebecca</persName> received—in her ears and hands the jewels.—The Spouse of Christ
               has put on—precious things that are from the water:—on her hand the living Body,—and
               in her ears the promises.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab><persName>Moses</persName> drew water and watered the sheep—of <persName>Jethro</persName> the priest of sin.—But our Shepherd
               has baptized His sheep—Who is the high priest of truth.—At the well the flocks were
               dumb,—but here the sheep have speech.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The People passed through the water and were baptized:—the People came up on dry
               land and became as heathen.—The Commandment was savourless in their ears;—the manna
               corrupted in their vessels.—Eat ye the living Body,—the medicine of life that gives
               life to all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>To the sons of Lot <persName>Moses</persName> said,—<quote>Give us water for money,—let us only pass by through
               your border.</quote>—They refused the way, and the temporal water.—Lo! the living water
               freely<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> given,—and the path that leads to <placeName>Eden</placeName>!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>From the water <persName>Gideon</persName> chose for himself—the men who were victorious in the
               battle.—Ye have gone down to the victorious waters:—come ye up and triumph in the
               fight!—receive from the water atonement,—and from the fight the crowning!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>Ye baptized, receive your lamps,—like the lamps of the house of <persName>Gideon</persName>;—conquer the
               darkness by your lamps,—and the silence by your hosannas!—<persName>Gideon</persName> likewise in the
               battle—triumphed by the shout and the flame.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab><persName>David</persName> the King longed after—the water of the well, and they brought it him;—but he
               drank it not, for he saw that with blood of men it was bought.—In the midst of the
               water ye have revelled—that was bought with the blood of God.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Out of <persName>Edom</persName> the prophet saw—God coming as one that presses the grapes.—He made ready
               the winepress of wrath,—He trod down the peoples and delivered the People.—He has
               turned and ordained Baptism;—the peoples live, the People is come to nought.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>In the river <persName>Jeremiah</persName> buried—the linen girdle that was marred;—and [the People]
               waxed old and decayed.—…—The peoples that were decayed and marred,—by the waters have
               been clad in newness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>In <placeName>Siloam</placeName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> the blessed stream—the priests anointed <persName>Solomon</persName>.—His youth was had in
               honour;—his old age was despised.—Through the pure waters ye have been clad—in the
               purity of Heaven.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>The fleece that was dry from the dew,—<placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> was figured in it:—the bason that
               was filled with water,—Baptism was figured in it.—That was dry after the manner of
               its type;—this was full after the manner of its symbol.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>The wearied body in water—washes and is refreshed from its toil.—Lo! the laver in
               which are hidden—refreshing and life and delights.—In it wearied <persName>Adam</persName> had rest—who
               brought labour into the creation.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>The fountain of sweat in the body—is set to protect against fever:—the fountain of
               Baptism—is set to protect against the Flame.—This is the water that avails—for the
               quenching of <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>He who journeys through the desert,—as armour takes to himself water—against
               all-conquering thirst.—Go ye down to the fountain of Christ,—receive life in your
               members,—as armour against death.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Again, the diver brings up—out of the sea the pearl.—Be baptized and bring up from
               the water—purity that therein is hidden,—the pearl that is set as a jewel—in the
               crown of the Godhead.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Sweet water in his vessel—the seaman lays up as a store;—in the midst of the sea he
               lays up and keeps it, the sweet in the midst of the bitter.—So amidst the floods of
               sin,—keep ye the water of Baptism.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>The woman of <placeName>Samaria</placeName> said to our Lord,—<quote>Lo! verily the well is deep.</quote>—Baptism though
               it be high,—in its mercy has stooped down with us:—for the atonement is from
               above—that has come down unto sinners.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab><quote>He that drinks the water that I shall give him,—verily never again shall he
               thirst.</quote>—For this holy Baptism,—for it be ye athirst, my beloved;—never again shall
               ye be athirst,—so that ye should come to another baptism.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>In the baptism of <persName>Siloam</persName>—the blind man washed, and his eyeballs—were opened and
               enlightened by the water;—he cast off the darkness that was on them.—The hidden
               darkness ye have cast off;—from the water ye have been clad in light.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab>His hands <persName>Pilate</persName> washed—that he might not be of them that slew.—Ye have bathed your
               bodies,—your hands together with your mouths.—Go in and be of them that eat,—for this
               medicine of life gives life to all.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="24">
            <ab><quote>Come after Me and verily I will make you—fishers of men.</quote>—For instead of a draught
               of that which perishes,—they fished for the draught that is forever.—They who had
               taken fishes for death,—baptized and gave life to them that were to die.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="25">
            <ab>An hundred and fifty fishes were taken—by <persName>Simon</persName>’s net from the water;—but there were
               taken by his preaching,—out of the bosom of Baptism,—ten thousands and thousands of
               men,—a draught of the sons of the Kingdom.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="26">
            <ab>Lo! our priest as a fisher—over the scanty water is standing;—he has taken thence a
               great draught—of every shape and of every kind;—he has drawn up the draught to bring
               it near—to the King of kings, most high.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="27">
            <ab><persName>Simon</persName> took the fishes and drew them up,—and they were brought near before our
               Lord:—Our priest has taken from out of the water,—by the Hand which he received from
               Simon,—virgins and chaste men who are brought near—in the festival of the Lord of
               feasts.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="28">
            <ab>In Thy mercy I adjure Thee pardon me,—for in mercy Thou too hast sworn,—Rabboni, <quote>In
               the death of him that dieth,—I have no pleasure, but in his life.</quote>—Thou hast sworn
               and I have adjured:—O Thou Who hast sworn, pardon him who has adjured!</ab>
