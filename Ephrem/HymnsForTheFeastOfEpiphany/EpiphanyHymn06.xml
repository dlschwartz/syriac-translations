         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Blessed be He Who was baptized that He might baptize you, that ye should
               be absolved from your offences.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>The Spirit came down from on high,—and hallowed the waters by His brooding.—In the
               baptism of John,—He passed by the rest and abode on One:—but now He has descended and
               abode,—on all that are born of the water.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Out of all that John baptized,—on One it was that the Spirit dwelt:—but now He has
               flown and come down,—that He may dwell on the many;—and as each after each comes
               up,—He loves him and abides on him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>A marvel it is that surpasses all!—To the water He went down and was baptized.—The
               seas declared it blessed,—that river wherein Thou wast baptized:—even the waters that
               were in heaven envied,—because they were not worthy to be Thy bath.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>A marvel it is, O my Lord, now also,—that while the fountains are full of water,—it
               is the water of baptism,—that alone is able to atone.—Mighty is the water in the
               seas,—yet is it too weak for atonement.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Thy might, O my Lord, if it abides,—within the humble it exalts him;—like as royalty
               if it abide—within the desert gives it peace.—Water by Thy might has triumphed—over
               sin, for Life has encompassed it.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The sheep exulted when they saw—the hand draw nigh to baptize them.—Receive, O ye
               sheep, your sealing; enter and be mingled in the flock!—for more than over all the
               flock,—over you rejoice the Watchers to-day.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>The Angels and the Watchers rejoice—over that which is born of the Spirit and of
               water:—they rejoice that by fire and by the Spirit,—the corporeal have become
               spiritual.—The Seraphins who sing <quote>Holy</quote> rejoice,—that they who are made holy have
               been increased.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>For lo! the Angels rejoice—over one sinner if he repent:—how much more do they now
               rejoice—that in all churches and congregations,—lo! Baptism is bringing forth—the
               heavenly from the earthly!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>The baptized when they come up are sanctified;—the sealed when they go down are
               pardoned.—They who come up have put on glory;—they who go down have cast off
               sin.—Adam put off his glory in a moment;—ye have been clothed with glory in a
               moment.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>A house that is of dust when it has fallen,—by means of water can be renewed:—the
               body of Adam that was of dust,—which had fallen by water has been renewed.—Lo! the
               priests as builders—afresh renew your bodies.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>A great marvel is this of the wool,—that it can take every dye,—as the mind takes
               every discourse.—By the name of its dye it is called;—as ye who were—baptized when
               <quote>Hearers,</quote>—have gained the name of <quote>Recipients.</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>The common waters he sanctified—even Elisha through the Name that is secret.—In them
               washed the leper openly,—and was cleansed by the Power that is secret:—the leprosy
               was done away in the water, as transgressions in Baptism.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>To-day, lo! your offences are blotted out,—and your names are written down.—The
               priest blots out in the water;—and Christ writes down in Heaven.—By the blotting out
               and the writing down—lo! doubled is your rejoicing.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Lo! mercy has dawned to-day;—and from bound to bound it stretches:—the sun has sunk
               and mercy has dawned.—Justice has drawn in her wrath; Grace has spread forth her
               love,—lo! she pardons and quickens freely.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>The sheep that beforetime were in the fold—lo! they hasten forth to greet—the new
               lambs that have been added to it.—They are white and are clad in white;—within and
               without white are your bodies as your vestments.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>From every mouth <quote>Blessed are ye,</quote>—on every side <quote>Blessed are ye.</quote>—Sin from you is
               driven out,—and the Holy Spirit on you is dwelling.—The Evil One is become sad of
               countenance;—the Good God makes glad your countenance.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>The gift that ye have received freely,—cease not from watching over it:—this pearl
               if it shall be lost—cannot again be sought out,—for it is like to virginity—which if
               it be lost is not to be found.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>May ye from all defilement—be kept by the power of your white robes!—and he whose
               freedom has defiled itself—may it be able to wash itself clean by his weeping!—For me
               who am servant of the community—may the supplication of the community win
               pardon!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>To the author who has toiled in words,—be reconciliation in rest!—to the teacher who
               has toiled with voice,—be forgiveness through grace!—to the priest who has toiled in
               baptizing,—let there come the crown of righteousness!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>From every mouth with one consent,—of those beneath and those above,—Watchers,
               Cherubin, and Seraphin,—the baptized, the sealed, and the hearers,—let each of us cry
               aloud and say,—<quote>Glory to the Lord of our feasts!</quote></ab>
