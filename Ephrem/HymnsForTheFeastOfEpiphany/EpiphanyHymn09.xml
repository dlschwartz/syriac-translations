         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Blessed is He Who came down, and sanctified water for the remission of the
               sins of the children of Adam!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>O John, who sawest the Spirit,—that abode on the head of the Son,—to show how the
               Head of the Highest—went down and was baptized—and came up to be Head on
               earth!—Children of the Spirit ye have thus become,—and Christ has become for you the
               Head:—ye also have become His members.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Consider and see how exalted ye are;—how instead of the river Jordan—ye have
               glorious Baptism, wherein is peace;—spreading her wings to shade your bodies.—In the
               wilderness John baptized:—in Her pure flood of Baptism,—purely are ye baptized
               therein.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Infants think when they see its glory,—that by its pomp its might is enhanced.—But
               it is the same, and within itself—is not divided.—But the might which never waxes
               less or greater—in us is little or again great;—and he in whom is great
               understanding,—great in him is Baptism.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>A man’s knowledge, if it be exalted,—exalted also is his degree above his
               brethren;—and he whose faith is great,—so also is his promise;—and as is his wisdom,
               so also his crowning.—As is the light, which though it be all goodly—and equal all of
               it with itself,—yet goodlier is one eye than another.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Jesus mingled His might in the water:—put ye Him on my brethren as discerning
               men!—For there are that in the water merely—perceive that they are washed. With our
               body be our soul washed!—The manifest water let the body perceive,—and the soul the
               secret might;—that both to the manifest and to the secret ye may be made like!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>How beautiful is Baptism—in the eye of the heart; come, let us gaze on it!—Like as
               by a seal ye have been moulded;—receive ye its image,—that nought may be lacking to
               us of our image!—For the sheep that are white of heart—gaze on the glory that is in
               the water:—in your souls reflect ye it!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Water is by nature as a mirror,—for one who in it examines himself.—Stir up thy
               soul, thou that discernest,—and be like unto it!—For it in its midst reflects thy
               image;—from it, on it, find an example;—gaze in it on Baptism,—and put on the beauty
               that is hidden therein!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>What profits it him that hears—a voice and knows not its significance?—Whoso hears a
               voice and is devoid—of the understanding thereof,—his ear is filled but his soul is
               empty.—Lo! since the gift is abundant,—with discernment receive ye it.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>Baptism that is with understanding—is the conjunction of two lights,—and rich are
               the fountains of its rays.—……—And the darkness that is on the mind departs,—and the
               soul beholds Him in beauty,—the hidden Christ of glory,—and grieves when the glory
               fails.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Baptism without understanding—is a treasure full yet empty;—since he that receives
               it is poor in it,—for he understands not—how great are its riches into which he
               enters and dwells.—For great is the gift within it,—though the mean man perceives
               not—that he is exalted even as it.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Open wide your minds and see, my brethren,—the secret column in the air, whose base
               is fixed from the midst of the water—unto the door of the Highest Place, like the
               ladder that Jacob saw.—Lo! by it came down the light unto Baptism,—and by it the soul
               goes up to Heaven,—that in one love we may be mingled.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Our Lord when he was baptized by John—sent forth twelve fountains;—and they issued
               forth and cleansed by their streams—the defilement of the peoples.—His worshippers
               are made white like His garments,—the garments in Tabor and the body in the
               water.—Instead of the garments the peoples are made white,—and have become for Him a
               clothing of glory.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>From your garments learn, my brethren,—how your members should be kept.—For if the
               garment, which ever so many times—may be made clean,—is duly kept for the sake of its
               comeliness,—the body which has but one baptism—manifold more exceeding is the care of
               its keeping,—for manifold are its dangers.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Again the sun in a house that is strait,—is straitened therein though he be
               great:—but in a house that is goodly and large,—when he rises thereon—far and wide in
               it he spreads his rays;—and though the sun is one and the same in his nature,—in
               divers houses he undergoes changes:—Even so our Lord in divers men.</ab>
