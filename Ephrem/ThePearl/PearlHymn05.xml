         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>O gift that camest up without price<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> with the diver! Thou laidest hold upon this
               visible light, that without price rises for the children of men: a parable of the
               hidden One that without price gives the hidden Dayspring!</ab>
            <ab>And the painter too paints a likeness of thee with colours. Yet by thee is faith
               painted in types and emblems for colours, and in the place of the image by thee and
               thy colours is thy Creator painted.</ab>
            <ab>O thou frankincense without smell, who breathest types from out of thee! thou art not
               to be eaten, yet thou givest a sweet smell unto them that hear thee! thou art not to
               be drunk, yet by thy story, a fountain of types art thou made unto the ears!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>It is thou which art great in thy littleness, O pearl! Small is thy measure and
               little thy compass with thy weight; but great is thy glory: to that crown alone in
               which thou art placed, there is none like.</ab>
            <ab>And who hath not perceived of thy littleness, how great it is; if one despises thee
               and throws thee away, he would blame himself for his clownishness, for when he saw
               thee in a kingâ€™s crown he would be attracted to thee.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Men stripped their clothes off and dived and drew thee out, pearl! It was not kings
               that put thee before men, but those naked ones who were a type of the poor and the
               fishers and the Galileans.</ab>
            <ab>For clothed bodies were not able to come to thee; they came that were stript as
               children; they plunged their bodies and came down to thee; and thou didst much desire
               them, and thou didst aid them who thus loved thee.</ab>
            <ab>Glad tidings did they give for thee: their tongues before their bosoms did the poor
               [fishers] open, and produced and showed the new riches among the merchants: upon the
               wrists of men they put thee as a medicine of life.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>The naked ones in a type saw thy rising again by the sea-shore; and by the side of
               the lake they, the Apostles<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> of a truth, saw the rising again of the Son of thy
               Creator. By thee and by thy Lord the sea and the lake were beautified.</ab>
            <ab>The diver came up from the sea and put on his clothing; and from the lake too <persName>Simon
               Peter</persName> came up swimming and put on his coat;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> clad as with coats, with the love of
               both of you, were these two.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>And since I have wandered in thee, pearl, I will gather up my mind, and by having
               contemplated thee, would become like thee, in that thou art all gathered up into
               thyself; and as thou in all times art one, one let me become by thee!</ab>
            <ab>Pearls have I gathered together that I might make a crown for the Son in the place of
               stains which are in my members. Receive my offering, not that Thou art shortcoming;
               it is because of mine own shortcoming that I have offered it to Thee. Whiten my
               stains!</ab>
            <ab>This crown is all spiritual pearls, which instead of gold are set in love, and
               instead of ouches in faith; and instead of hands, let praise offer it up to the
               Highest!</ab>
