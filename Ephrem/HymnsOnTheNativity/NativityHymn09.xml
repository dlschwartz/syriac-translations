         <div type="section">
            <ab>Come rest, and be still in the bosom of Thy Mother, Son of the Glorious. Forwardness
               fits not the sons of kings. O Son of David, Thou art glorious, and [yet] the Son of
               Mary, who dost hide Thy beauty in the inner chamber.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>To whom art Thou like, glad Babe, fair little One, Whose Mother is a Virgin, Whose
               Father is hidden, Whom even the Seraphim are not able to look upon? Tell us whom Thou
               art like, O Son of the Gracious!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>When the wrathful came to see Thee, Thou madest them gladsome: they exchanged smiles
               one with another: the angry were made gentle in Thee, O sweet One. Blessed art Thou,
               little One, for that in Thee even the bitter are made sweet.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Who ever saw a Babe that was gladsome when in arms to those that came near him, lo!
               reached Himself unto them that were far off? Fair sight [to see] a Child, that takes
               thought for every man that they may see him!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>He that hath care came and saw Thee, and his care fled away. He that had anxiety; at
               Thee forgat his anxiety; the hungry by Thee forgat his victuals; and he that had an
               errand, by Thee was errant and forgot his journey!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>O still Thyself, and let men go to their works! Thou art a son of the poor, learn
               from Thyself that all the poor had to leave their work to come. Thou who lovest men,
               hast bound men together by Thy gladsomeness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>David, that stately king, took branches,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> and in the feast amongst the children as
               he danced, he gave praise. Is it not the love of David Thy father that is warm in
               Thee?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>That daughter of Saul! her father’s devil spake in her: she called the stately
               [king] a vile fellow, because he gave an ensample to the elders of her people of
               taking up branches with the children in the day of praise to Thee.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Who would not fear to lay it to Thee that Thou art forward? For lo, the daughter of
               Saul who mocked the child, cut off her womb from childbearing; because her mouth
               derided, the reward of its mouth was barrenness.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> Let mouths tremble at blasphemy,
               lest they be shut up! Refrain, O daughter of Sion, thy mouth from Him, for He is the
               Son of David, Who is gladsome before thee. Be not unto Him as the daughter of Saul,
               whose race is extinct.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Because Elijah restrained the desire of the body, he withheld rain from the
               adulterous; because he kept under his body, he withheld dew from the whoremongers,
               who let their fountains be loosely poured out.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Because the hidden fire of the lust of the body ruled not in him, to him the fire
               from on high was obedient. And since he subdued on the earth the lust of the flesh,
               he went up thither where holiness dwells and is at peace.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Elisha also who deadened his own body, quickened the dead. The resurrection of the
               dead was in the usual course by a sanctification not in the usual course; He raised
               the child, because he purified his soul like a weaned child.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Moses, who divided and separated himself from his wife, divided the sea before the
               harlot. Zipporah though daughter of a heathen priest kept sanctity: with a calf the
               daughter of Abraham<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> went a whoring.</ab>
