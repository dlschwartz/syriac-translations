            <ab>The Babe that I carry carries me, saith Mary, and He has lowered His wings, and
               taken and placed me between His pinions, and mounted into the air; and a promise has
               been given me that height and depth shall be my Son’s.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>I have seen Gabriel that called him Lord, and the high priest the aged servant, that
               carried Him and bare Him. I have seen the Magi when they bowed down, and Herod when
               he was troubled because the King had come.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Satan also who strangled the little ones that Moses might perish,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> murdered the
               little ones that the Living One might die. To Egypt He fled, Who came to Judea that
               He might labour and wander there: he sought to catch the man that would catch
               himself.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>In her virginity Eve put on the leaves of shame: Thy Mother put on in her Virginity
               the garment of Glory that suffices for all. She gave the little vest of the Body to
               Him that covers all.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Blessed is she in whose heart and mind Thou wast! A King’s palace she was by Thee, O
               Son of the King, and a Holy of Holies by Thee, O High Priest! She had not the trouble
               nor vexation of a family, or a husband!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Eve, again, was a nest and a den for the accursed serpent, that entered in and dwelt
               in her. His evil counsel became bread to her that she might become dust. Thou art our
               Bread, and Thou art also [of] our race and our garment of glory.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>He that has sanctity, if he be in danger, lo! here is his Guardian! He that has
               iniquity, lo! here is his Pardoner! He that has a devil, here is the Pursuer thereof!
               They that have pains, lo! here is the Binder up of their breaches.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>He that has a child, let him come and become a brother to my Well-beloved!<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> He
               that has a daughter or a young woman of his race, let her come and become the bride
               of my Glorious One! He that has a servant, let him set him free, that he may come and
               serve his Lord.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The son of free men that bears Thy yoke, my Son, shall have one reward; and the
               slave that bears the burden of the yoke of two masters, of Him above and of Him
               below, there are two blessings for him, and two rewards of the two burdens.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The free woman, my Son, is Thy handmaid: also if she who is in bondage serve Thee,
               in Thee she is free: in Thee she shall be comforted, because she is freed; hidden
               apples in her bosom are stored up,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> if she love Thee!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>O chaste woman, long ye for my Well-beloved, that He may dwell in you; and ye also
               that are impure that He may sanctify you! ye Churches also, that the Son of the
               Creator Who came to renew all creatures, may adorn you!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>He received the foolish who worshipped and served all the stars; He renewed the
               earth which was worn out through Adam, who sinned and waxed old. The new formation
               was the creature of its Renewer, and the all-sufficient One repaired the bodies along
               with their wills.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Come ye blind, and without money receive lights! Come ye lame, and receive your
               feet! ye deaf and dumb, receive your voice! come thou also whose hand is cut off; the
               maimed also shall receive his hands.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>It is the Son of the Creator Whose treasure-houses are filled with all manner of
               helps. Let him that is without eyeballs come to Him that makes clay and changes it,
               that makes flesh, that enlightens eyes.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>By the small portion of clay He shows that it was with His hand that Adam was
               formed: the soul of the dead also bears Him witness, that by Him it was that the
               breath of man was breathed in; by the last witnesses He was accredited to be the Son
               of Him Who is the First.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Gather ye together and come, O ye lepers, and receive purification without labour.
               For He will not wash you as Elisha, who baptized seven times in the river: neither
               will He trouble you as the priests did with their sprinklings. Foreigners and also
               strangers have betaken themselves to the Great Physician.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The rank of strangers hath no place with the King’s Son; the Lord makes not Himself
               strange to His servants, [or conceal] that He is Lord of all. For if the Just makes
               the body leprous, and Thou purifiest it; then, the Former of the body hateth the
               body; but Thou lovest it.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>And if it be not Thy forming, being Just, Thou wouldest not have healed it;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> and
               if it were not Thy creature, when in health, Thou wouldest not have afflicted it. The
               punishments that Thou has cast upon it, and the pains which Thou hast healed,
               proclaim that Thou art the Creator’s Son.</ab>
