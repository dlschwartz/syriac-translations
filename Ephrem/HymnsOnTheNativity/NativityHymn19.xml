            <ab>Response: Blessed be thy Birth that gladdens all creatures!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>The first year wherein, our Saviour was born,—is source of blessing, and ground of
               life;—for by it are borne,—manifold triumphs, the sum of all help:—as the first day
               of <quote>the beginning,</quote>—the great pillar of all creatures,—bears the building of
               Creation;—so the year of the Firstborn bears help for man.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>In the second year, of our Saviour’s Birth,—the Magi exult, the Pharisees
               mourn:—treasures are opened,—kings are hastening, and infants are slain.—For in it
               are offered in <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>,—oblations precious and terrible;—for while love made
               offering of gold,—hatred offered infants by the sword.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>The day of the All-Lightening, exults in His birth;—a pillar of radiance, which
               drives away, by its beams—the works of darkness. After the type of that day, wherein
               light was created,—and sundered the darkness that spread—over the fair beauty of
               Creation;—the radiance of our Saviour’s birth—came in to sunder the darkness that was
               on the heart.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>The first day the source and the beginning,—orders the roots, to make all things
               grow.—Our Saviour’s day—is praised far above it, a tree planted in the world.—For His
               Death is as the root in the earth; His Resurrection as the head in heaven; on all
               sides His words reach as boughs; likewise His Body as fruit for the eaters.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Let the second day, sing praise to the Birth—of the second Son, and His voice which
               first—commanded the firmament and it was made,—divided the waters that were above,
               and gathered the seas that were under.—He Who divided waters from waters, divided
               Himself from the Watchers and came down to man.—For the waters which at His command
               were gathered.—He cleft the fountain of life and gave drink.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>Let the third day weave with divers hymns—the crown of psalms and with one voice
               present it—for His Birth who gave growth—of buds and flowers, on the third day.—But
               now He the All-giver of growth,—has come down and become the All-holy Flower; from
               the thirsting earth has sprang forth and gone up,—that he may decorate and crown the
               conquerors.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Let the fourth day praise, first among the four,—His Birth Who created as the fourth
               day—the two lightgivers,—which fools worship, and are sightless and blind.—The Lord
               of Lightgivers has come down,—and from the womb has shone on us as the Sun.—His
               splendours have opened the eyes of the blind:—His rays have given light to the
               wandering.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Let the fifth day laud Him Who created—on the fifth day creeping things and
               Dragons—of whose kind is the serpent.—He deceived with guile our mother, a maid void
               of counsel.—The deceiver who had mocked the maid,—by the Dove was exposed as
               false,—which from a virgin bosom sprang, and came forth—the Wise that trod down the
               crafty.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>Let the sixth day laud Him who created—on Vesper-day <persName>Adam</persName>, whom <persName>Satan</persName> envied; as a
               feigned friend—cheered him in offering poison in his food.—The medicine of life
               reached them both,—put on a body and came near to both.—The mortal tasted Him and
               lived through Him;—the devourer who ate Him was left void.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Let the seventh day hallow the Holy One,—Who halloweth the Sabbath, and gave rest to
               all that live.—The Blessed One Who wearied not—has care for mankind, and has care for
               the beasts.—When Freedom fell under the yoke,—He came to the Birth and became bond to
               make it free:—He was smitten on the face by servants in the judgment hall;—He broke
               the yoke that was on the free, as Lord.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Let the eighth day, which circumcised the Hebrews,—praise Him Who commanded his
               namesake <persName>Joshua</persName>—to circumcise with a flint—the people circumcised in body, while the
               heart was profane within.—Lo! as the eighth day, as a Babe,—to circumcision He came
               Who circumcises all.—Though the sign of <persName>Abraham</persName> is on His Flesh,—the blind daughter
               of <placeName>Sion</placeName> had defiled it.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Let the tenth day sing, praises in its turn.—For God the first letter of Jesus
               (goodly name!), is ten in numbering.—He Who is as a lamb, turns back the numbers.—For
               when the number goes up to ten, it is turned back to begin again from one. O great
               mystery of that which is in <persName>Jesus</persName>, Whose might turns all creation back again!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>The All-Purifier Firstborn in the day of His purifying,—purified the purification of
               the firstborn and was offered<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> in the Temple:—the Lord of offering needed
               offerings,—to make offering of birds.—In His Birth were fulfilled the types,—in His
               purification and circumcision the allegories.—He came and paid over debts in His
               coming down;—in His Resurrection He went up and sent down treasures.</ab>
