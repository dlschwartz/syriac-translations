         <div type="section">
            <ab>The Son of the Maker is like unto His Father as Maker! He made Himself a pure body,
               He clothed Himself with it, and came forth and clothed our weakness with glory, which
               in His mercy He brought from the Father.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>From Melchizedek, the High Priest, a hyssop came to Thee, a throne and crown from
               the house of David, a race and family from Abraham.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Be thou unto me a Haven, for Thine own sake, O great Sea. Lo! the Psalms of David
               Thy Father, and the words also of the Prophets, came forth unto me, as it were
               ships.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>David Thy father, in the hundred and tenth Psalm, twined together two numbers as it
               were crowns to Thee, and came [to Thee], O Conqueror! With these shalt Thou be
               crowned, and unto the throne shalt Thou ascend and sit.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>A great crown is the number that is twined in the hundred, wherein is crowned Thy
               Godhead! A little crown is that of the number ten, which crowns the Head of Thy
               Manhood, O Victorious One!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>For Thy sake women sought after men. Tamar desired him that was widowed, and Ruth
               loved a man that was old, yea, that Rahab, that led men captive, was captivated by
               Thee.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Tamar went forth, and in the darkness<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> stole the Light, and in uncleanness stole
               the Holy One, and by uncovering her nakedness she went in and stole Thee, O glorious
               One, that bringest the pure out of the impure.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Satan saw her and trembled, and hasted to trouble her. He brought the judgment to
               her mind, and she feared not; stoning and the sword, and she trembled not. He that
               teacheth adultery hindered adultery, because he was a hinderer of Thee.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>For holy was the adultery of Tamar, for Thy sake. Thee it was she thirsted after, O
               pure Fountain. Judah defrauded her of drinking Thee. The thirsty womb stole a
               dew-draught of Thee from the spring thereof.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>She was a widow for Thy sake. Thee did she long for, she hasted and was also an
               harlot for Thy sake. Thee did she vehemently desire, and was sanctified in that it
               was Thee she loved.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>May Tamar rejoice that her Lord hath come and hath made her name known for the son
               of her adultery! Surely the name she gave him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> was calling unto Thee to come to
               her.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>For Thee honorable women shamed themselves, Thou that givest chastity to all! Thee
               she stole away in the midst of the ways, who pavest the way into the kingdom! Because
               it was life that she stole, the sword was not able to put her to death.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Ruth lay down by a man in the threshingfloor for Thy sake; her love made her bold
               for Thy sake, O Thou that teachest all penitents boldness. Her ears refused [to
               listen to] any voices for the sake of Thy voice.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The live coal that glowed went up into the bed, of Boaz, lay down there, saw the
               High Priest, in whose loins was hidden a fire for his incense!<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> She hasted and was
               a heifer to Boaz, that should bring forth Thee, the fatted Calf.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>She went gleaning for her love of Thee; she gathered straw. Thou didst quickly pay
               her the reward of her lowliness; and instead of ears of corn, the Root of Kings, and
               instead of straws, the Sheaf of Life, didst Thou make to spring from her.</ab>

            <note xml:id="n3">The introduction of Ruth after Tamara was doubtless suggested by Ruth
               iv. 12, Mat. i. 3, etc. St. E. seems to mean, <quote>Ruth saw by faith Christ the High
               Priest, in whose loins was to be that Fire of Righteousness which alone could make
               the incense (i.e. the child which rose up from Ruth, who is called a coal) to be
               acceptable.</quote></note>
