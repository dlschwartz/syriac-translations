         <div type="section">
            <ab>This is the month which brings all manner of joy; it is the freedom of the bondsmen,
               the pride of the free, the crown of the gates, the soothing of the body, that also in
               its love put purple upon us as upon kings.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>This is the month that brings all manner of victories; it frees the spirit; it
               subdues the body; it brings forth life among mortals; it caused, in its love,
               Godhead, to dwell in Manhood.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>In this day the Lord exchanged glory for shame, as being humble; because <persName>Adam</persName>
               changed the truth for unrighteousness as being a rebel: the Good One had mercy on
               him, justified and set right them that had turned aside.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Let every man chase away his weariness, since that Majesty was not wearied with
               being in the womb nine months for us, and in being thirty years in <placeName>Sodom</placeName> among the
               madmen.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> Because the Good One saw that the race of man was poor and humbled, He
               made feasts as a treasure-house, and opened them to the slothful, that the feast
               might stir up the slothful one to rise and be rich.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Lo! the First-born has opened unto us His feast as a treasure-house. This one day in
               the whole year alone opens that treasure-house: come, let us make gain, let us grow
               rich from it, ere they shut it up.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Blessed be the watchful, that have taken by force<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> from it the spoil of Life. It
               is a great disgrace, when a man sees his neighbor take and carry out treasure, and
               himself sits in the treasure-house slumbering, so as to come forth empty.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>In this feast, let each one of us crown the gates of his heart. The Holy Spirit
               longs for the gates thereof, that He may enter in and dwell there, and sanctify it,
               and He goes round about to all the gates to see where He may enter.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>In this feast, the gates are glad before the gates,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> and the Holy One rejoices in
               the holy temple, and the voice resounds in the mouth of children, and Christ rejoices
               in His own feast as a mighty man.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>At the Birth of the Son the king was enrolling all men for the tribute-money, that
               they might be debtors to Him: the King came forth to us Who blotted out our bills,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/>
               and wrote another bill in His own Name that He might be our debtor. The sun gave
               longer light, and foreshadowed the mystery by the degrees which it had gone up.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> It
               was twelve days since it had gone up, and to-day is the thirteenth day: a type exact
               of the Son’s birth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> and of His Twelve.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab><persName>Moses</persName> shut up a lamb in the month Nisan on the tenth day; a type this of the Son
               that came into the womb and shut Himself up therein on the tenth day.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> He came
               forth from the womb in this month in which the sun gives longer light.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The darkness was overcome, that it might proclaim that Satan was overcome; and the
               sun gave longer light, that it might triumph, because the First-born was victorious.
               Along with the darkness the dark one was overcome, and with the greater light our
               Light conquered!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab><persName>Joseph</persName> caressed the Son as a Babe; he ministered to Him as God. He rejoiced in Him
               as in the Good One, and he was awe-struck at Him as the Just One, greatly
               bewildered.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab><quote>Who hath given me the Son of the Most High to be a Son to me? I was jealous of Thy
               Mother, and I thought to put her away, and I knew not that in her womb was hidden a
               mighty treasure, that should suddenly enrich my poor estate. <persName>David</persName> the king sprang of
               my race, and wore the crown: and I have come to a very low estate, who instead of a
               king am a carpenter. Yet a crown hath come to me, for in my bosom is the Lord of
               crowns!</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>With rival words <persName>Mary</persName> burned, yea she lulled Him, [saying,] Who hath given me, the
               barren, that I should conceive and bring forth this One, that is manifold; a little
               One, that is great; for that He is wholly with me, and wholly everywhere?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The day that <persName>Gabriel</persName> came in unto my low estate, he made me free instead of a
               handmaid, of a sudden: for I was the handmaid of Thy Divine Nature, and am also the
               Mother of Thy human Nature, O Lord and Son!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Of a sudden the handmaid became the King’s daughter in Thee, Thou Son of the King.
               Lo, the meanest in the house of <persName>David</persName>, by reason of Thee, Thou Son of <persName>David</persName>, lo, a
               daughter of earth hath attained unto Heaven by the Heavenly One!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>How am I astonied that there is laid before me a Child, older than all things! His
               eye is gazing unceasingly upon Heaven. As for the stammering of His mouth, to my
               seeming it betokens, that with God its silence speaks.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Who ever saw a Child the whole of Whom beholdeth every place? His look is like one
               that orders all creatures that are above and that are below! His visage is like that
               Commander that commandeth all.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>How shall I open the fountain of milk to Thee, O Fountain? Or how shall I give
               nourishment to Thee that nourishest all from Thy Table? How shall I bring to
               swaddling clothes One wrapped round with rays of glory?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>My mouth knows not how I shall call Thee, O Thou Child of the Living One: for to
               venture to call Thee as the Child of <persName>Joseph</persName>, I tremble, since Thou art not his seed:
               and I am fearful of denying the name of him to whom they have betrothed me.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>While Thou art the Son of One, then should I be calling Thee the Son of many. For
               ten thousand names would not suffice Thee, since Thou art the Son of God and also the
               Son of man, yea, <persName>David</persName>’s Son and <persName>Mary</persName>’s Lord.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Who hath made the Lord of mouths to be without a mouth? For my pure conception of
               Thee wicked men have slandered me. Be, O Thou Holy One, a Speaker for Thy Mother.
               Show a miracle that they may be persuaded, from Whom it is that I conceived
               Thee!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>For Thy sake too I am hated, Thou Lover of all. Lo! I am persecuted who have
               conceived and brought forth One House of refuge for men. <persName>Adam</persName> will rejoice, for Thou
               art the Key of Paradise.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Lo, the sea raged against Thy mother as against <persName>Jonah</persName>. Lo, Herod, that raging wave,
               sought to drown the Lord of the seas. Whither I shall flee Thou shalt teach me, O
               Lord of Thy Mother.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>With Thee I will flee, that I may gain in Thee Life in every place. The prison with
               Thee is no prison, for in Thee man goes up unto Heaven: the grave with Thee is no
               grave, for Thou art the Resurrection!<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> A star of light which was not nature, shone
               forth suddenly; less than the sun and greater than the sun, less than it in its
               visible light, but greater than it in its hidden might, by reason of its
               mystery.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The Morning Star cast its bright beams among the darknesses, and led them as blind
               men, and they came and received a great light: they gave offerings and received life,
               and they worshipped and returned.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>In the height and the depth two preachers were there to the Son: the bright star
               shouted above; <persName>John</persName> also preached below, two preachers, an earthly and a
               heavenly.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>That above showed His Nature to be from the Majesty, and that below too showed his
               Nature to be from mankind. O great marvel, that His Godhead and His Manhood each was
               preached by them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Whoso thought Him earthly, the bright star convinced him that He was heavenly; and
               whoso thought Him spiritual, <persName>John</persName> convinced him that He was also corporeal.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>In the Holy temple <persName>Simeon</persName> carried Him, and lulled Him, [saying,] <quote>Thou art come, O
               Merciful One, showing mercy on my old age, making my bones to go into the grave in
               peace. In Thee shall I be raised from the grave into Paradise!</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab><persName>Anna</persName> embraced Him, and put her mouth to His lips, and the Spirit dwelt upon her own
               lips. As when <persName>Isaiah</persName>’s mouth was silent, the coal<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> which approached his lips opened
               his mouth; so <persName>Anna</persName> burned with the Spirit of His mouth, yea, she lulled Him,
               [saying,] <quote>Son of the Kingdom, Son of the lowliness, that hearest and art still, that
               seest and art hidden, that knowest and art unknown, God, Son of Man, glory be unto
               Thy Name.</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The barren also heard, ran, and came with their provisions: the Magi came with their
               treasures, the barren came with their provisions. Provisions and riches were suddenly
               heaped up in the house of the poor.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The barren woman cried out, as at that which she looked not for, Who hath granted me
               this sight of thy Babe, O Blessed One, by whom the heaven and earth are filled!
               Blessed be thy Fruit, which made the barren vine to bear a cluster.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab><persName>Zacharias</persName> came and opened his venerable mouth and cried, <quote>Where is the King, for

            <ab><persName>John</persName> approached with his parents and worshipped the Son, and He shed glory upon his
               countenance; and he was not moved as when in the womb! Mighty miracle, that here he
               was worshipping, there he leaped.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab><persName>Herod</persName> also, that base fox, that stalked about like a lion, as a fox crouched down,
               and howled, when he heard the roaring of the Lion, who came to sit in the kingdom
               according to the Scriptures. The fox heard that the Lion was a whelp, and as a
               suckling; and he sharpened His teeth, that while He was yet a child the fox might lie
               in wait and devour the Lion ere He had grown up, and the breath of His mouth should
               destroy him.</ab>

         <div type="section">
            <ab>The whole creation became mouths to Him, and cried concerning Him. The Magi cried by

               that air, lo! the Son of the King!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The Heavens were opened, the waters were calmed, the Dove glorified Him, the voice
