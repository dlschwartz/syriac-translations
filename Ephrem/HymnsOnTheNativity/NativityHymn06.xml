            <ab>Blessed be the Messenger that was laden, and came; a great peace! The Bowels of the
               Father brought Him down to us; He did not bring up our debts to Him, but made a
               satisfaction to that Majesty with His own goods.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Praised be the Wise One, who reconciled and joined the Divine with the Human Nature.
               One from above and one from below, He confined the Natures as medicines, and being
               the Image of God, became man.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>That Jealous One when He saw that <persName>Adam</persName> was dust, and that the cursed serpent had
               devoured him, shed soundness into that which was tasteless, and made him [as] salt,
               wherewith the accursed serpent should be blinded.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Blessed be the Merciful One, who saw the weapon by Paradise, that closed the way to
               the Tree of Life; and came and took a Body which could suffer, that with the Door,
               that was in His side, He might open the way into Paradise.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Blessed be that Merciful One, who lent not Himself to harshness, but without
               constraint conquered by wisdom; that He might give an ensample unto men, that by
               virtue and wisdom they might conquer discerningly.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Blessed is Thy flock, since Thou art the gate thereof, and Thou art the staff
               thereof. Thou art the Shepherd thereof, Thou art the Drink thereof, Thou art the salt
               thereof, yea, the Visitor thereof. Hail to the Only-Begotten, that bare abundantly
               all manner of consolations!</ab>

         <div type="section">
            <ab>The husbandmen came and did obeisance before the Husbandman of Life. They prophesied
               to Him as they rejoiced, [saying,] <quote>Blessed be the Husbandman, by Whom the ground of
               the heart is tilled, Who gathereth His wheat into the garner of Life.</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The husbandmen came and gave glory to the Vineyard that sprang of the root and stem
               of <persName>Jesse</persName>, the Virgin Cluster of the glorious Vine. <quote>May we be vessels for Thy new
               Wine that renews all things.</quote></ab>

         <div type="section">
            <ab><quote>In Thee may the Vineyard of my Well-beloved that yielded wild grapes[1] find peace!
               Graft its vines from Thy stocks; let it be laden entirely from Thy blessings with a
               fruit which may reconcile the Lord of the Vineyard, Who threatens it.</quote></ab>

         <div type="section">
            <ab>Because of <persName>Joseph</persName> the workmen came to the Son of <persName>Joseph</persName> saying, <quote>Blessed be Thy
               Nativity, Thou Head of Workmen, the impress whereof the ark bore, after which was
               fashioned the Tabernacle of the congregation that was for a time only!</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/></ab>
         </div>

            <ab><quote>Our craft praises Thee, Who art our glory. Make Thou the yoke which is light, yea
               easy, for them that bear it; make the measure, in which there can be no falseness,
               which is full of Truth; yea, devise and make measures[3] by righteousness; that he
               that is vile may be accused thereby, and he that is perfect, may be acquitted
               thereby. Weigh therewith both mercy and truth, O just One, as a judge.</quote></ab>

            <ab><quote>Bridegrooms with their brides rejoiced. Blessed be the Babe, whose Mother was Bride
               of the Holy One! Blessed the marriage feast, whereat Thou wast present, in which when
               wine was suddenly wanting, in Thee it abounded again!</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>The children cried out, <quote>Blessed He that hath become unto us a Brother, and
               Companion in the midst of the streets. Blessed be the day which by the Branches[4]
               gives glory to the Tree of life, that made His Majesty be brought low, to our
               childish age!</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Women heard that a Virgin should conceive and bring forth a Son: honourable women
               hoped that thou wouldest rise from them; yea noble ladies that Thou mightest spring
               up from them! Blessed be Thy Majesty, that humbled Itself, and rose from the
               poor!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Yea the young girls that carried Him prophesied, saying, <quote>Whether I be hated or
               fair, or of low estate, I am without spot for Thee. I have taken Thee in charge for
               the bed of Childbirth.</quote></ab>

         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <ab>Who ever dared to speak to her son as in prayer? O Trust of Thy Mother as God, her

            <note xml:id="n2">So too St. E. himself upon Exodus xxxvii. <quote>And Bezaleel made an ark of
               undecaying wood, a type of the Body of <persName><persName>Immanuel</persName></persName>, which is incorruptible, and not
               soiled by sin. By the gold within and without he indicates the Divine Nature of the
               Word, which was united unto all the functions (S. vessels) of the Soul and the Body
               in a manner no discourse can reach, seeing he anointed our manhood with His Godhead.</quote>
               These words appear to make it plain, that St. E. means the same ark above as in this
               passage; he, however, uses a different word, and one which others contend is only
               applied to <persName>Noah</persName>’s ark.</note>
            <note xml:id="n3">St. Mark vi. 3, intimates that our Lord was a carpenter Himself, while
