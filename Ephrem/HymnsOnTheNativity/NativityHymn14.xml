            <ab>Response: Blessed be he who became beyond measure low, that he might make us beyond
               measure great</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>Of the Birth of the Firstborn, let us tell on His Feast-day.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/>—He gives on His day,
               secret comforts.—If the unclean King at his feast, in memory of his day,—gave the
               gift of wrath, the head in a charger,—how much more shall the Blessed, give blessings
               to him—who sings praise at His Feast!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Let us not count our vigil like vigils of every day.—His feast, its reward, exceeds
               an hundredfold.—For this feast makes war, on sleep by its vigil;—speaking it makes
               war, on silence by its voice;—clad with all blessings, it is chief of feasts,—and of
               every joy.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>To-day the angels, and the archangels,—descended to sing—a new song on earth.—In
               this mystery they descend, and rejoice with the vigil-keepers.—At the time when they
               gave praise, blasphemy abounded.—Blessed be the Birth by which, lo! the world
               resounds—with anthems of praise.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>For this is the night that joined, the Watchers on high with the vigil-keepers.—The
               Watcher came to make watchers in the midst of creation.—Lo! the vigil-keepers are
               made comrades with the Watchers:—the singers of praise are made, companions of the
               Seraphs.—Blessed be he who becomes, the harp of Thy praise!—and Thy grace becomes his
               reward.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>The Birth then of the Firstborn, I will sing and tell how—the Godhead in the womb
               wove itself a vesture.—He put it on and came forth in birth, in death again put it
               off;—once he put it off, twice He put it on.—On the left He wore it, then took it off
               thence,—and laid it at the right.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>He dwelt in a narrow bosom, the Might that rules all.—While He was dwelling there,
               He held the reins of the whole:—to His Father He made offering, that He might fulfil
               His Will:—Heaven was filled by Him, and every creature.—The Sun entered the womb, and
               in the height and the depth—his splendour abode.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>He dwelt in the wide bosoms, of all the creatures;—too narrow to hold, the greatness
               of the Firstborn.—How then sufficed for it, that bosom of Mary?—Marvellous if it
               sufficed, bewilderment if it sufficed not.—Of all bosoms that held Him, one bosom
               sufficed for Him,—His, the Supreme Who begat Him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>The bosom that held Him, if it held Him Wholly,—equals the wondrous bosom, of the
               Supreme Who begat Him.—But who dare say the bosom, that is narrow weak and lowly,—is
               equal to His, Who is the Supreme Being?—He dwelt there of His mercy, though so great
               is His Nature:—it is without bound.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>Reconciling Peace, sent to the nations!—gladdening Brightness, that camest to the
               sad!—Mighty Leaven in silence, overcoming all!—Patient One that hast taken, man after
               man in Thy net!—Happy he who has welcomed, thy joy in his heart,—and forgot his
               groans in Thee!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>They sounded forth peace, the Watchers to the vigil-keepers.—Among the vigil-keepers
               the good tidings, were announced by the Watchers.—Who would sleep on that night,
               which has waked all creatures?—For they bear good tidings of peace, where warfare had
               been.—Blessed is he who has pleased, the Divine Majesty by his silence,—when speaking
               moved His wrath!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Watchers mixed with watchers, they rejoiced that the world came to life.—The Evil
               One was shamed who was king, and had woven a crown of lies;—and set up his throne, as
               God in the world.—The Babe laid in the manger, cast him from his dominion.—The Sun
               rendered worship, doing Him homage by his Magi;—in his worshippers he worshipped
               Him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>God saw that mankind, worship things created:—He put on a created body, that in our
               custom He might capture us.—Lo! in this our form, He that formed us healed us;—and in
               this created shape, our Creator gave us life.—He drew us not by force: blessed be He
               Who came in ours,—and joined us in His!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Who would not marvel, at Mary, David’s daughter,—bearing an infant, and her
               virginity kept!—She lays Him on her breast, and lulls Him with song and He
               rejoices.—The Angels raise hymns, the Seraphs cry <quote>Holy,</quote>—the Magi offer, acceptable
               gifts,—to the Son Who is born.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>O great above measure, immeasurably made low,—praised beyond praises, debased to
               humiliation!—the tender mercies laid on Thee, bowed Thee down to all this;—let Thy
               grace bow me down, though evil to give praise!—Happy he who becomes, a fountain of
               voices,—all praising Thee in all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>He was servant on earth; He is Lord in Heaven.—Heir of height and depth, He became a
               stranger:—Whom men judged in guile, He is judge in truth:—He Whose face they spat on,
               breathes His Spirit on theirs:—He Who held the frail reed, is become the staff of the
               world,—which grows old and leans on Him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>He Who rose to wait on His servants, now sits to be worshipped.—Whom the scribes
               despised, before Him Seraphs cry <quote>Holy.</quote>—This praise Adam desired, to steal
               privily.—The serpent which made him fall, saw to what height he was raised:—he
               crushed it because it deceived him; the feet of Eve trod it down,—which had sent
               venom into her ears.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>The wife proved barren, and withheld her fruit;—but the bosom of Mary, holily
               conceived.—To wonder at fields, and to admire plants—she needed not who received, and
               rendered what she borrowed not.—Nature confessed its defeat; the womb was aware of
               it,—and restored what Nature gave not.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Mary was defeated, in the judgment by Elizabeth.—She that was barren pleaded, that
               the Will which prevailed—to close the open door, has opened the closed.—He has made
               childless the married womb; He has made fruitful the virgin womb.—Because the People
               were accurst faithless, He made her that was married,—held from bearing before the
               face of the maiden.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>He Who could give moisture, to breasts barren and dead,—caused them to fail in
               youth, made them to flow in age;—forced and changed nature, in its season and out of
               its season.—The Lord of natures changed, the Virgin’s nature.—Because the People were
               barren, He made her that was aged,—a mouth on behalf of the damsel.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>And as He began at birth, He went on and fulfilled in death.—His Birth received
               worship; His Death paid the debt.—As He came to His Birth, the Magi worshipped
               Him;—again He came to His Passion, and the thief sought refuge in Him—Between His
               Birth and Death, midway He set the world:—in birth and Death he gave it life.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>Thousand thousands stand, and ten thousand thousands haste.—The thousands and ten
               thousands, cannot search out the One:—for all of them stand, in silence to serve.—He
               has no heir of His Throne, save the Son Who is of Him.—In the midst of silence is the
               enquiry into Him, when the watchers come to search Him out,—they attain to silence
               and are stayed.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>The Firstborn entered the womb, and the pure Virgin was not harmed.—He stirred and
               came forth in her travail, and the fair Mother was troubled by Him.—Glorious and
               unseen in entering, humble and manifest in issuing;—for He was God in entering, and
               He was man in issuing.—A marvel and bewilderment to hear: fire entered the womb; put
               on a body and came forth!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab>Gabriel chief of Angels, called Him <quote>My Lord</quote>:—he called Him <quote>My Lord,</quote> to teach
               that He was his Lord, not his fellow.—Gabriel had with him, Michael as fellow:—the
               Son is Lord of the servants; exalted is His Nature as His Name.—No servant can search
               Him out; for the greater the servant,—He is great above His servant.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="24">
            <ab>When they stand before Thee, the watchers with songs of praise,—they know not in
               what part, they shall discern Thee.—They have sought Thee above in the height; they
               have seen Thee below in the depth:—they have searched for Thee in the midst of
               heaven; they have seen Thee in the midst of the abyss:—they have discerned Thee
               beside Him that is worshipped; they have found Thee in the midst of the
               creatures:—they have come down to Thee and sung Glory to Thee.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="25">
            <ab>Thou art all wonderful, in all parts where we seek Thee.—Near art Thou,—and far, and
               who may attain to Thee?—No seeking avails, that its stretch should reach unto
               Thee.—Whereon it stretches to reach Thee, it is checked and stops,—it falls short of
               Thy mountain; Faith reaches thither,—and Love with prayer.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="26">
            <ab>The Magi also sought Him, and in the manger when they found Him,—instead of scrutiny
               worship, they offered Him in silence;—for empty strivings, oblations gave they
               Him.—Seek thou too the Firstborn, and if thou find Him in the height,—instead of
               troubled questionings, open thy treasures before Him,—and offer Him thy works.</ab>
