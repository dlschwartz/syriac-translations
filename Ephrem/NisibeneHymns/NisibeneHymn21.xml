            <ab>John who was a torch, laid bare and rebuked the wanton ones: they made haste and
               quenched the torch, that they might let loose the desire of their lust. Be thou a
               lamp in brightness, and make the works of darkness cease, that whensoever thy
               doctrine shines, no man may dare at its rising, to give ear to the lusts of darkness.

            <ab>A great blessing was hidden in it, even in the reproof of Elijah. Elisha ministered
               unto him and sought, a twofold reward of his ministration. Twofold glory it gave to
               him, for in double measure was he clad with his virtues. Thou who hast loved the
               reproof of Valgesh thy master rich in gifts, mayest thou inherit the treasure of his
               wisdom! </ab>

               money be overcome by thee! like as it was overcome before Simeon, Mayest thou bind on
               earth even as he, and loose on high after his likeness; for thy faith is even as his!

               Jeremiah’s, thy gentleness the Apostles’! Thine be the ancient things of the

               staff and a hand to old age; be a wall to the consecrated virgins. In thy

               And let not her deceased be buried in the cutting off of hope heathenishly, with
               vestments and wailing and lamentation; for the living is clothed in raiment, but the
               deceased his all is a coffin. </ab>

               well-springs close thou up, lest there be a great outpouring, and there come from it

               speaks first, and who second and third: and if every man keeps his mouth, and every

               has removed temptation from every man, lest even he who is not hateful should deny
