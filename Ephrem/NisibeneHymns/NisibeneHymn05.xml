         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>Cause to be heard in Thy grace, the tidings of Thy salvation: for an hearing has
               been made, a path of passage; our minds have been downtrodden, by messages of terror.
            </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Praises to Thy victory! Glory to Thy Dominion!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Comfort Thou with profits, though small and scanty, those that have had harvest, of
               hurt by their labour: at a time of profit, they have gained but loss.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>It is manifest that He has stood, portioning wrath upon earth: loss and profit in
               anger He divided. There are whom He has cast down of a sudden, and there are whom He
               has puffed up of a sudden.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>To teach us that He can, chastise in all ways; when He saw the persecutors, were
               terrible before mine eyes, He laid me out before my children, and they my beloved
               chastised me.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Lo! He taught me to fear, Himself and not man: for when there was none to smite us,
               His wrath gave command of a sudden, and every man stretched himself out, and
               chastised himself.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>In like manner that Babylonian, who struck down all kings when he was confident and
               hoped that there was none to smite him, God caused that by his own hands, he should
               strike himself down.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>His majesty and his mind, of a sudden became mad together: he rent and cast off his
               garments; he went forth and wandered in the desert; he drove himself out first, and
               then his servants drove him out.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>He showed to all kings, whom he had led captive and brought down, that not by his
               own power, could he have overcome: the power that struck him down, was that which
               punished them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>I have stood and borne, O my Lord; the blows of my deliverers. Thou art able in Thy
               grace, to make me profit by the smiters: Thou art able in Thy justice to punish me by
               my helpers.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>The day when the host was bold, to come up against Samaria; their plenty and their
               pleasure, their treasures and their possessions, they cast away and forsook and fled.
               He crowned her by her persecutors.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>My beloved ones crowned me, and my deliverers healed me. Through the guilt of my
               dwellers, my helpers chastised me, give me drink from Thy vines, of the cup of
               consolation!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>The corn and the vine, preserve, O my Lord, by Thy grace! Be the husbandman cheered,
               by the vine of the grape-gatherer; be the vinedresser glad, in the corn of the
               husbandman!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>They are joined each to each, the corn and the grape. In the field the reapers, wine
               can make cheerful, in the vineyard the dressers, bread strengthens in turn.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>These two things have power, to comfort my troubles: the Trinity has power, to
               comfort more exceedingly; whom I will praise because of a sudden, I was delivered
               through grace.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>But the man whose life, is preserved through grace, if he goes away to murmur, at
               the loss of his goods, he is thankless for the grace, of Him who had pity on
               him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>Of His own will He destroys, one thing instead of another. He destroys possession,
               and spares the possessor: He destroys our plants, instead of our lives.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>Let us fear to murmur, lest His own wrath be roused, and He spare the possessions,
               and smite the possessor; that we may learn in the end, His mercy in the
               beginning.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Let us learn against whom, it is meet for us to murmur. Learn thou to murmur, not
               against the Chastener, but against thine own will, that made thee sin and thou wast
               punished.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Let us put away murmuring, and turn unto prayer: for if the possessor dies, his
               possessions also cease for him; but while he survives, he seeks to recover his
               losses.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>Let consolations be multiplied, in mercy to my dwellers: let the remainder and
               residue, console us in the midst of wrath; and cause Thou us to forget in the
               residue, the mourning of our devastation!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>Heal and increase O my Lord, the fruits Thy wrath has left! They seem to me like
               sick ones, that have escaped in pestilence. Make me to forget in these weak ones, the
               suffering of the many!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>While I speak, O my Lord, I call to mind that this too is the month, when the
               blossom pined, and dropped off in blight, may it return to soundness, to be a
               consolation!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab>For these escaped the pestilence, that carried off their brethren. The vines though
               voiceless, wept when before them, a multitude was cut down and felled, of trees that
               they loved.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="24">
            <ab>The company of plants, lo! the earth misses! The roots for the husbandmen, weep and
               cause them to weep. Their beauty had spread and gave shade, and it was torn away in
               one hour.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="25">
            <ab>The axe came nigh and struck; and struck the husbandman; the blow was on the trees,
               and it caused the husbandman to suffer; every axe that smote, he bore the pain of
               it.</ab>
