            <ab>Come, let us hear how they contend for victory: the guilty ones who never have
               conquered, nor will conquer.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Death said unto the Evil One: In the end the victory is mine: for Death is master of
               the close, as a conqueror.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: This were to be Death indeed, wert thou able: to bring to death a living man,
               by means of lusts.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Death: Lo! I who behold the dead, both good and bad: the righteous who despise thee, O

         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: This dying of the body, is sleep for a time: think not, O Death, that thou art
               Death, who art as a shadow.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>Death: Thee, O Evil One, the just have conquered, yea will conquer: but these that have
               conquered thee, lo! I conquer.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: Even this that thou bringest to death the just, is not of thyself: because of
               Adam whom I conquered, they drink this cup.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Death: Lo! <placeName>Sheol</placeName> is full of the men of <placeName>Sodom</placeName>, and the Assyrians: and the giants who were
               in the flood, who is like me?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: These, O Death, all of them, by me were slain: I am he that caused them to sin so
               that they perished.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Death: <persName>Joseph</persName> who conquered thee I conquered, O <persName>Satan</persName>: in the chamber he conquered thee
               but I conquered, and cast him into the tomb.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: <persName>Moses</persName> who conquered thee, O Death, by sprinkling of blood: he conquered thee in
               <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, but at the rock, who conquered him?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Death: <persName>Elijah</persName> who feared thee not, O <persName>Satan</persName>: fled before <persName>Jezebel</persName>’s face, because he

         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: <persName>Aaron</persName> who withstood thee, O Death, with smoke of incense: to him I gave earrings
               of gold: and he fashioned a calf.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Death: Thou wentest down to contend with <persName>Job</persName>, and he conquered thee and came up: but I,

               conquered, who had conquered <persName>Goliath</persName>.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>Death: <persName>Jehu</persName> who destroyed the house of <persName>Baal</persName>, the temple of the Evil One: was unable to

            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: <persName>Solomon</persName> who snatched from thy mouth, a child by his judgment: him in his old age
               I made a builder of idol-altars.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Death: <persName>Samuel</persName> who in respect of gold scorned thee, O <persName>Satan</persName>: him I conquered, the

         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: <persName>Samson</persName> who in respect of the lion’s whelp, scorned thee, O Death: through
               <persName>Delilah</persName>, frail vessel, I yoked him to the mill.</ab>
         </div>

            <ab>Death: <persName>Josiah</persName> from his childhood despised thee, Evil One: but me not even in his old
               age, could he withstand.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: <persName>Hezekiah</persName> withstood thee, Death, when he overcame the bound of life: I misled him
               and he neglected the miracle, and showed his treasures.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>Death: <persName>John</persName> who conquered thee, Evil One, and absolved and baptized: I extinguished that

         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: <persName>Simon</persName> overcame thee, when he brought to life that blessed woman: in a woman he
               overcame thee and by a woman I overcame him and made him deny.</ab>

         <div type="section" n="24">
