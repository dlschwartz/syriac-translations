         <head>Nisibis 15</head>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>If the head had not been right,—haply the members had murmured:—for when because of
               a perverse head—the course of the members is put astray,—they are wont to lay the
               blame on the head. </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Blessed be He who chose thee the pride of our people!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>If now on one that is all goodly,—on it we lay our hatred;—how much more if we were
               hateful!—Yea even God though He is kind,—bitter men complain against Him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Be like the head O ye members!—Get repose in his purity—and pleasantness in his
               tranquillity;—in his sanctity renown,—and in his wisdom learning!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Get discernment in his mildness,—and chastity in his gravity,—and bounty in his
               poverty!—As he is fully and altogether fair,—let us be altogether fair with him!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>See ye how meted and weighed—are his words and his actions!—Take heed how even his
               steps—keep the measure of peace!—With all his might he holds the bridle of all
               himself.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>He was master over his youth;—he bound it in the yoke of chastity:—his members were
               not enticed by lust;—for they were kept under the rod:—his will he had in
               subjection.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>For he was ready beforehand for his degree,—as he was ready beforehand in his
               conversation,—as he laid his foundations securely.—He became Head in his youth,—when
               they made him preacher to the people.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Excellent was he among preachers,—learned was he among scholars,—and understanding
               was he among the wise:—chaste was he among his brethren,—and grave among his familiar
               friends.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>In two abodes was he—a solitary recluse from his early days;—for he was holy within
               his body,—and solitary within his dwelling;—openly and secretly was he chaste.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>But although we my brethren—have put astray those measures,—and we have lost that
               savour,—and have become teachers to ourselves,—unto the perfection that called
               us.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Yet that measure of Truth—preserves itself in its vessel:—Truth chose it because she
               saw it chose her;—she has preserved in it her fragrance and savour,—from the
               beginning to the end.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>The Head both chaste and grave,—that was not wrathful nor hard,—nor transgressed
               even as we did,—set and kept his own measures,—and cast a bridle on his
               thoughts.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>He gave example in his person,—that as he kept the measure of his time,—so was it
               meet that we should know our time.—We have become strangers to our time,—for we have
               been witless in the time of discernment.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>In the beginning the blast of the wind—in its might chastens the fruit;—then in the
               meantime the might of the sun:—but when its mightiness is passed,—its end gathers his
               sweetness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>But we—they that were first chastened us;—and also they that came next rebuked
               us;—and they that were last added sweetness to us:—then when the time of tasting us
               arrives,—great was our savourlessness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>For we came to maturity,—that we might wean the children from wantonness,—and lead
               them to gravity:—but our old age stood in need—that we should be rebuked as
               youths.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>Accordingly he in kindness endured, nor did he make use of force,—that he might
               increase honour to our old age:—and even if it knew not its degree,—let him be
               magnified who knew its time!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>And if one say that for the multitude,—force and the rod should govern it;—even as
               for the thief fear,—and for the spoiler threatening,—and for fools open shaming.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Yet if with the head as first,—the members had hasted to move as second,—they would
               have drawn that which was third,—and the whole body from the end—would have followed
               after them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>They that were second despised those that were first,—and that were third those that
               were second:—the degrees were set at naught one by another.—While these within
               despised one another,—they were trodden down likewise by those without.</ab>
