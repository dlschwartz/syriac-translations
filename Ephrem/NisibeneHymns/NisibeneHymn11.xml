         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>Thy chastening is, as a mother of our infancy:—her rebuke is merciful, in that Thou
               hast restrained,—the children from folly, and they have been made wise! </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Glory be to thy justice!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Let us search out Thy justice; for who is sufficient—to measure its help? since by
               it the wanton—are oftentimes made chaste.—</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Oftentimes Thy hand, O my Lord, has made the sick whole,—for it is the healer in
               secret of their diseases,—and the fount of their life.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Exceeding gently, the finger of Thy justice,—in love and compassion, touches the
               wounds—of him that is to be healed.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Exceeding mild and merciful, is her cutting to him that is wise:—her sharp remedy,
               in its mighty love,—consumes the corrupt part.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>Exceeding welcome her wrath, to him that is discerning;—but her remedies are hated,
               of the fool who has delight—in the trouble of his limbs.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Exceeding eager is she, to bind the cut she has made;—when she has smitten she
               pities, that from between these two—she may breed healing.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Exceeding welcome her wrath, and her anger pleasant,—and sweet her bitterness,
               sweetening bitter things—that they may be made pleasant.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>A cause of negligence is Thy indulgence to the careless;—a cause of profit, is Thy
               rod among the slothful—so that they become as traffickers.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>The cause of our affliction, it is Thy justice;—the cause of our carelessness, it is
               Thy graciousness,—for our understanding has turned foolish.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Pharaoh hardened himself, because of Thy graciousness;—for when the plagues were
               stayed, his cruelties waxed strong,—and he lied to his promises.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Justice requited him, because he lied greatly against her,—even Grace her freeborn
               sister; yea she restrained him again—that he should not again provoke.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Rebuke, O my Lord, my guide, for it has been false as Egypt —my prayers testify,
               that I am not as she,—for Thy door have I not forsaken.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Let Thy cross, O my Lord, which stands, in my breaches that are open,—repair again
               the breaches that are hidden; for instead of those without,—those within have cleft
               me asunder!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>A sea has broken through, and cast down, the watch tower wherein I had
               triumphed.—Iniquity has dared to set up, a temple wherein I am shamed: its
               drink-offering chokes me.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>My prayers on my walls, my persecutors have heard:—the sun and his worshippers, are
               ashamed of their magicians,—for I have triumphed by Thy cross.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>All creatures cried out, when they saw the struggle,—while Truth with falsehood, on
               my battered walls, fought and was crowned conqueror.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>The force of Truth, chastised falsehood:—in its chastisement it felt Truth, and
               through its own sins, it earned her victory.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>I have great alarm; for since my deliverance,—the honourable and mighty, who were
               devoted to my altar, have built in me high places.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>My seven senses, O my Lord, even though they had been as fountains of tears, yet my
               tears were too little—to lament our ruin.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>The streets that were in sackcloth, and ashes cried out,—disturbed by the play, akin
               to that which was,—in the wilderness before the calf.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>Poison seeks and wears, the beauty of lilies;—and though their buds may conceal, and
               hidden disguise it,—it blossoms in their bitter flowers.</ab>
