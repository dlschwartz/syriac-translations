            <ab>I will call in my affliction, on the Power that subdues all;—that is able to subdue,
               the Captor in his wrath,—as it overcame Legion. </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Glory to His grace!</ab>

         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>The Evil One has repaid me my brethren, debts that he borrowed not of me:—the good
               God likewise has repaid me, mercies that I lent Him not.—Come and marvel ye at these
               two things!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>The good God has divided and given, my misdeeds to His grace,—my offences to His
               justice; His mercy has blotted out my misdeeds—His judgment has requited my
               offences.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Sin was exceeding wroth, and abode in alarm,—when she saw how grace, put restraint
               on freedom, that she might overcome transgressions.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Glow Thou, O my Lord, and send down Thy love, break out and pour forth Thy
               wrath!—Thy wrath to destroy, Thy love to rescue—the captives from the captor!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The days wherein the Evil One, decreed to cast me forth,—as with a sling into
               perdition, in them the good God has bound up and kept—my soul in the bundle of
               life.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>The men of speech who keep not silence, from praising continually,—who have kept me
               in the midst of waves, and supported me that I fell not, let them give praise in my
               stead, O my Lord!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>For who has at any time sufficed, in presence of the grace,—of the mercies which
               surrounded him, that I should suffice to praise—the mercies that encompass me?</ab>
