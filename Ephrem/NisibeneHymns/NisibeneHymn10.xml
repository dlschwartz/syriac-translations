         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>My children have been slain; and my daughters that are without me,—their walls are
               overthrown, their children scattered,—and their holy places trodden down. </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Blessed is Thy chastisement!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>The fowlers have taken, my doves out of my strongholds,—which quitted their nests,
               and fled to the caves;—in the net have they taken them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>After the manner of wax, that melts before the fire,—thus melted and dissolved, the
               bodies, of my sons before the heat—and the drought of my strongholds.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>And instead of streams, of milk that used to flow,—for my sons and my little ones,
               milk fails the sucklings, and water the weaned children.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>The suckling falls, from its mother and gasps,—because it cannot suck, nor can she
               give suck:—they breathe out their spirit and die.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>How is it possible, that Thy grace can refrain—the welling of its stream, when it is
               not possible to restrain—the abundance of its flow?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>And why has Thy grace, shut up its mercies,—and withheld its streams, from the
               people that cry,—for one to moisten their tongue?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>And there was a pit, between them and their brethren;—like the rich man who cried,
               and there was none to answer,—to moisten his tongue.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>And as into the midst of fire, the wretched ones were cast;—and heat in the midst of
               thirst, the fire was blowing,—and kindling upon them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Their carcases were melted, and dissolved by the heat;—they that had thirsted gave
               in turn the earth to drink,—of the reek of their bodies.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>And the fort that with thirst, had killed, its dwellers,—it drank in its turn of the
               flux from the corpses,—that were melted by thirst.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Who has seen a people—that were burning with thirst,—while there surrounded them a
               wall of water and they could not—moisten their tongue!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Surely with the judgment of Sodom, were my beloved judged,—and my children smitten,
               with the torment of Sodom;—though that was but for one day.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>The torment of fire, though it be for one hour, O my Lord,—in lingering thirst, is a
               lingering death, and a subtle punishment.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>After my sorrows, O my Lord, and my bitter sufferings,—this is the best comfort,
               wherewith Thou hast comforted me,—that Thou hast multiplied my afflictions.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>The medicine that I hoped, it is sorrow decreed;—the binding up that I looked for,
               it is bitter calamity,—that it seeks to work for me.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>And whereas I hoped to escape, from the midst of the storm;—worse for me is the
               storm in it, even in the harbour,—than that in the sea.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Whereas I thought in my folly, that I should anchor and escape—from the midst of the
               Gulf; my sins have cast me back—again into the midst of it.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Look, O my Lord, on my limbs, how the swords are thick in me,—and have left their
               mark on my arms; and the scars of the spears,—are planted in my sides!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>Tears in mine eyes, and in my ears ill rumours,—wailing in my mouth, and mourning in
               my heart!—Add no more, O my Lord, to me!</ab>
