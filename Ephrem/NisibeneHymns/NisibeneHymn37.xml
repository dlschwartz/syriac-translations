            <ab>Death was weeping for her, even for <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, when he saw her treasury that it was
               emptied. And he said, Who, then, has plundered thy riches? <persName>Gehazi</persName> stole and was
               discovered; I am stealing every day, but theft has not been laid to my charge. I am
               sent to Kings, in their sicknesses, their guards are set around them, guards are also
               at their gate. The soul of kings I snatch and I go forth. </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="resopnse">
            <ab>Response: Blessed is He Who has broken the sting of Death by His Cross!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>All women grieve that are barren; <placeName>Sheol</placeName> rejoices because of her barrenness; she is
               desolate if so be that she brings forth. The all-compelling Power constrained it,
               even the bosom that was barren and cold, and it rendered back though wont to deny its
               debts. <persName>Rebekah</persName>, when the two babes afflicted her, asked for death. How great then the
               pain of <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, when there smote her strange pangs; the dead were roused and brake
               forth and came out from her bowels.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Is this then perchance that saying, which was heard by me from <persName>Isaiah</persName>? (but I
               despised it) when he arose and said, <quote>Who hath heard such a thing as this? that the
               earth should travail in one day, and bring forth a nation in one hour.</quote> Is it this
               that has come to pass? or else, is it reserved for us hereafter? And if it be this it
               is a vain shadow that I thought I am a king; I knew not it was but a deposit I was
               keeping.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Two utterances that were different, have I heard from him, even this <persName>Isaiah</persName>. For he
               said that a virgin should conceive and bring forth; and he said again that the earth
               should bring forth. But lo! the Virgin has brought Him forth, and <placeName>Sheol</placeName> the barren
               has brought Him forth; two wombs that contrary to nature, have been changed by Him;
               the Virgin and Sheol both of them. The Virgin in her bringing forth He made glad; but
               Sheol He grieved and made sad in His Resurrection.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>I saw in the valley that <persName>Ezekiel</persName>, who quickened the dead when he was questioned; and
               I saw the bones that were in heaps and they moved. There was a tumult of bones in
               <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, bone seeking for his fellow, and joint for her mate. There was there none that
               questioned, or that was questioned, whether those bones lived. Unquestioned, the
               voice of <persName>Jesus</persName>, the Master of all creatures quickened them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab><placeName>Sheol</placeName> was made sorrowful when she saw them, even the sorrowful dead made to rejoice.
               She wept for <persName>Lazarus</persName> when he went forth, <quote>Go in peace thou dead that livest, bewailed
               by two houses of mourning.</quote> Within and without were lamentations for him; for his
               sisters wept for him when he came into the grave unto me, and I wept for him as he
               went forth. In his death there was weeping among the living; likewise in <placeName>Sheol</placeName> is
               great mourning at his resurrection.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Now it is that I have tasted the taste of his sorrow, even of him who weeps over his
               beloved. The dead that are thus beloved of <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, how dear were they to their
               fathers! The limbs which I severed and carried away, lo! they are shorn away and
               carried off from me. If I thus suffer for the departure of him, the youth who was
               restored to life, blessed is He Who had compassion on the widow; in her only son He
               gave peace to her dwelling that had been made desolate.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Lo! this suffering which I cause men to suffer in their beloved ones, in the end on
               me it gathers itself altogether. For when the dead shall have left <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, for every
               man there will be resurrection, and for me alone torment. And who is he then that
               shall bear for me all these things, that I shall see Sheol left alone, because this
               voice which has rent the graves, makes her desolate and sends forth the dead that
               were in her midst?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>If a man reads in the Prophets, he hears there of righteous wars. But if a man
               meditate in the story of <persName>Jesus</persName>, he learns of grace and tender mercy. And if a man
               think of <persName>Jesus</persName>, that He is a strange God it is a reproach against me. No other
               strange key into the gate of Sheol could ever be fitted. One is the key of the
               Creator, that which has opened it, yea, is to open it at His Coming.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Who is he that is able to join the bones, save that Power which created them? What
               is it that shall reunite the shreds of the body, save the hand of the Maker? What is
               it that shall restore the forms, save the finger of the Creator? He, who created and
               turned and destroyed, is He that is able also to renew and raise up. Another God is
               unable to enter in and restore creatures not his own.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>But were he another Power, I should be very joyful that He is coming to me. Into the
               bosom of <placeName>Sheol</placeName> He would descend and learn that One alone is God. Mortals that have
               erred and preached that there are Gods many, lo! they are bound for me in <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, and
               their Gods have never grieved because of them. One God do I know, and His Prophets
               and His Apostles do I acknowledge.</ab>
