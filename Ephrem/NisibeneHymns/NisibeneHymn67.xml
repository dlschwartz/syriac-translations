            <ab>Come ye, let us hear how Death convicts the People: that harsher than Death was their
               sword, against the just.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Response: To Thee be glory, Who by Thy sacrifice, hast redeemed our disgrace: and Whose
               death was instead of all deaths, that Thou mightst raise all!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>It was not Death indeed that crucified <persName>Jesus</persName>, but it was the People: how hateful then
               the People, that are yet more hateful than I!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Into the pit they cast Jeremiah, the miry pit: but I in <placeName>Sheol</placeName> allotted, honour to his
               bones.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab><persName>Naboth</persName> they bruised to death with stones, as though he were a dog: how good am I who
               have never stoned, even a dog!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The Hebrew women in famine, ate their children: <placeName>Sheol</placeName> is good who delivers and gives
               them up, without difficulty.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>To the widow I gave her son, by the hand of <persName>Elijah</persName>: to the Shunamite her beloved, by
               the hand of <persName>Elisha</persName>.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>The Hebrew women in greed, ate their children: <placeName>Sheol</placeName> gave up the dead and learned, to
               fast soberly.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab><placeName>Sheol</placeName> was not indeed <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, but its semblance: <persName>Jezebel</persName> was the true <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, who
               devoured the just.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>The sons of the prophets and the prophets, she slew and cast down: to heaven <persName>Elijah</persName>
               escaped, from her fury.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>How many deaths instead of one Death, were among the People! and how many <placeName>Sheols</placeName>
               instead of one, were there also!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab><persName>Samaria</persName> and <persName>Jezrael</persName> her daughters, in <placeName>Israel</placeName>: and <placeName>Zion</placeName> and <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> her sister, in
               <placeName>Judea</placeName>.</ab>

         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Prophets and just men in <placeName>Judea</placeName>, and in <placeName>Israel</placeName>: in these two abysses, they were
               drowned.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Why then is <placeName>Sheol</placeName> hated, and she alone: though there be many that are hateful, rather
               than she?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>The dead of the men of <placeName>Judah</placeName>, to me are right hateful: yea, abhorred by me are their
               bones, in the midst of <placeName>Sheol</placeName>.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>Would that then I had a way to cast them out: to cast their bones thence from <placeName>Sheol</placeName>,
               for they cause her to rot.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>I wonder at the Holy Spirit, that He thus dwelt: in the midst of a People whose
               savour stank, as their conversation.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Onions and garlic are the heralds of their doings: as is the food so is the
               understanding, of this defiled people.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Through the supplication of all that bow, and worship Thy Father: have mercy on Thy
               worshipper, who is thankless for Thy love.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>From Hebrews and Aramaeans, and also from the Watchers: to Thee be praise and through
               Thee to Thy Father, be also glory!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>For that I have a mouth to Death, who is without mouth: may the Son Who is all
               mouths, hold back my offence from His Father!</ab>
