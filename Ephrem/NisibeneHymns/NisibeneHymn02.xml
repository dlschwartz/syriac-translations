         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>This day are opened, our mouths to give thanks. They who opened the breaches, have
               opened my sons’ mouths. Thank the Merciful, who has delivered the men of our city,
               nor thought at that time of exacting the debts that were due by us. When they rose up
               they that took us captive, the worlds in our deliverance, tasted of Thy
               graciousness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: From all that have mouths, glory be to Thy grace!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>He has saved us without wall, and taught us that He is our wall: He has saved us
               without king and made us know that is our king: He has saved us, in each and all, and
               showed us that He is All: He has saved us in His grace and again reveals, that freely
               He has mercy and quickens. From every boaster, He takes away his boasting, and gives
               it to His own grace.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>The sound of all mouths, is too little for Thy praise: for lo! in the hour when our
               light was smoking, and was at the point to be quenched (seeing that all is easy to
               Thee) of a sudden it awoke and shone! Who has seen these two marvels, that for him
               whose hope was cut off, hope has sprung up and increased; the hour of mourning has
               been turned into good tidings?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>This is a festival day, whereon hang the feasts: for if wrath had taken us captive,
               lo! our feasts too had ceased. Whereas our peace has conquered and triumphed, lo! our
               festivals resound. This blessed day supports all: upon it depends the city, on the
               city depends the people, on the people depends peace, on peace depends all.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Out of these breaches, Thou hast multiplied triumphs. Praise unto the Triune God
               goes up from the three breaches; for that He descended and repaired them, in His
               mercy which restrains wrath. He smote the enemy who understood not that He was
               teaching us. He taught those within, for in His justice He made the breaches; He
               taught those without, for in His goodness He repaired them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>Speak and give glory, my delivered ones on this day; old men and boys, young men and
               maidens, children and innocents, and thou, O Church, mother of the city! For the old
               men have been rescued from captivity, the youths from torture, the sucklings from
               being dashed in pieces, the women from dishonour, and the Church from mockery.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>He came to us with hardness; we were afraid for a moment: He came in gentleness, and
               we rejoiced for an hour. He turned and left us for a little, we wandered without end;
               like a beast of prey which is trained by blandishments and by fear, but if so be that
               men turn from it, rebels and strays and becomes savage in the midst of peace.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>He punished us and we feared not; He rescued us, and we were not shamed: He
               straitened us and our vows were multiplied; He enlarged us and our crimes were
               multiplied. When He constrained there was a covenant, when He gave breathing-space
               there was straying. Though He knew us He lowered Himself to establish us. In the
               evening we exalted Him; in the morning we rejected Him. When necessity left us,
               faithfulness left us.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>He afflicted us by the breaches, that He might punish our crimes: He raised the
               mounds that thereby, He might humble our boasting. He made a breach for the seas that
               thereby, He might wash away our pollution. He shut us in that we might gather
               together in His Temple. He shut us in and we were quenched; He set us free and we
               went astray. We are like unto wool, which passes into every colour.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>We know that when the blessed sons of <placeName>Nineveh</placeName> repented, it was not because of mounds
               they repented, nor yet by means of waters, nor was it by reason of a breach, nor yet
               by reason of bows; it was not at the sound of the bowstring they feared and repented.
               They harkened to a feeble voice; they caused their little ones to fast; they made
               their youths chaste, they made their kings humble.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Thou smotest us and we justified Thee, for it befel not by chance; Thou deliveredst
               us and we gave thanks, for it was not that we were worthy. Thou hadst mercy on us not
               because Thou erredst, in hoping that we should repent. It was manifest to Thee that
               when Thou hadst mercy on us we strayed. Thou knewest that we had sinned; Thou knewest
               that we are sinners: with our iniquity that has been and is, Thou wast acquainted
               when Thou hadst mercy on us.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Weigh our repentance, that it may outbalance our crimes! But not in even balance,
               ascends either weight; for our crimes are heavy and manifold, and our repentance is
               light. He had commanded that we should be sold for our debt: His mercy became our
               advocate; principal and increase, we repaid with the farthing, which our repentance
               proffered.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Ten thousand talents for that little payment, our debt He forgave us. He was bound
               to exact it, that He might appease His justice: He was constrained again to forgive,
               that He might make His grace to rejoice. Our tears for the twinkling of an eye we
               gave Him; He satisfied His justice, in exacting and taking a little; He made His
               grace to rejoice, when for a little He forgave much.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Ten thousand are the crimes that He has pardoned; ten thousand tongues, are unable
               to suffice, in presence of His goodness. He has pardoned us and we have not pardoned;
               we have requited to Him contrariwise; the guilt committed we write up afresh.
                  <quote>Pardon, O Lord,</quote> we cry; <quote>Requite, O Lord,</quote> we pray:
                  <quote>pardon</quote> verily when we have done wrong; <quote>requite</quote>
               verily when wrong is done us.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>Yea not as those without, have we laboured for our lives. They have raised their
               mounds, but we not even our voices: they have broken through the wall, but we—not
               even the chains, the frail chains on our heart within have we broken. God has
               rejected the diligent, for the sake of the slothful; He has rejected the labour done
               without, though He was rejected from within.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>He has set free them that talked, and smitten the silent; the wall was beaten, and
               the people were instructed: He spared them that can suffer, He smote that which knows
               no suffering. For instead of souls that feel, He smote the stones that feel not, that
               He might chasten us. In His love He spared our bodies, and hasted to smite our
               wall.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>Who has ever seen, that a breach became as a mirror? Two parties looked thereinto;
               it served for those without and those within. They saw therein as with eyes, the
               Power that breaks down and builds up: they saw Him who made the breach and again
               repaired it. Those without saw His might; they departed and tarried not till evening:
               those within saw His help; they gave thanks yet sufficed not.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Let the day of thy deliverance, arouse thee from sloth! When the wall was broken
               through, when the elephants pressed in, when the javelins showered, when men did
               valiantly, then was there a sight for the heavenly ones. Iniquity fought there; mercy
               triumphed there; lovingkindness prevailed below; the watchers shouted on high.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>And thine enemy wearied himself, striving to smite by his wiles, the wall that
               encompassed thee, a bulwark to thine inhabitants. He wearied himself and availed not;
               and in order that he might not hope, that if He broke through He should also enter
               and take us captive, he broke it through and not once only; and was put to shame, nor
               was that enough, even unto three times, that he might be shamed thrice in the
               three.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>Let my happiness by God’s grace, be also multiplied in thy midst! Whereas in thee my
               crimes have been many, many be in thee my fruits! Whereas in thee I have sinned in my
               youth, in thee let there be mercy for my old age! By the mouth of thy sons pray for
               thy son, for I have sinned beyond my ability, and have repented below my ability; I
               have scattered above measure, and have gathered below measure.</ab>
