            <ab>O virgin-youth that art become bridegroom, move to a little jealousy thy mind,
               towards her who is the wife of thy youth: cut off the attachments which she had, in
               her girlhood with many others; rebuke her and call together her affections, that she
               may know what she is and whose she is. In thee may she desire yea love, Christ the
               Bridegroom of truth. </ab>

            <ab>Be jealous O husbandman against the tares, which have sprung up and entangled
               themselves among the wheat. Easy is it to root up the thicket, rather than the
               despised: if a slight breeze bears it, it attacks the sowing and conquers it. That
               which three husbandmen have sown, may it return in threefold measure! thirty-fold and
               sixty and an hundred! </ab>

            <ab>A new shepherd for him it is right, that he should oversee the flock in new wise,
               and should know what is the number of it, and should see what are its needs. A flock
               it is that was purchased with the blood, of that chief of the shepherds. Call thou
               and cause to pass each sheep by its name, for it is a flock whereof the name is
               written, and its reckoning in the Book of life. </ab>

            <ab>Lo the spouse of thy Lord is with thee! keep her from all harm, and from men that
               deal corruptly, and call the congregations by their own names. The name of her spouse
               is set on her; let her not go a whoring for another name, for she was not baptized in
               the name of man; with Names wherein she was baptized let her make confession, of the
               Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. </ab>

            <ab>The Apostle her betrother was jealous over her, that she should not be corrupted by
               names, yet not by names that were false, but not even by names that were true; not by
               <persName>Cephas</persName> yea not by his name. They who were true betrothers, set the Name of her
               betrothed upon her; the false betrothers like whoremongers, set their own names on
               the flock. </ab>

            <ab>The stamp on living creatures, O my brethren, no man destroys openly; and a name
               that is signed to a letter, no man adds to or alters: whoso effaces the stamp is a
               thief; and whoso alters the name is a falsifier. The name of Christ has been altered;
               names of falsehood lo! have been set, upon the congregations that have been
               corrupted. </ab>

            <ab>Look at the Prophets and Apostles, how like they are each to the other! By the
               Prophets the Name of God, was set on the flock of God; and by the Apostles the Name
               of Christ, was set on the Church of Christ. The false betrothers also are like one
               another for by their names are called, the congregations who commit whoredom with
               them. </ab>
