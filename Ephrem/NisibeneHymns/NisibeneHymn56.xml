         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>With Freedom is thy struggle, O Evil One: it can cast on thee a muzzle, if it so
               please.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Response: To Thee be glory in whose victory we have gained strength: and in whose
               resurrection we defy even Death itself!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Lo! again these two exposed each other, how weak both are: Death reminded the Evil
               One of thy mightiness (O Freedom).</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>Thy fire is in thy nest, O Death, and thou perceivest not: the fate of the departed,
               to thee is overthrow.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Lo! Death and the Evil One proclaim thy mightiness (O Freedom): yea, the Evil One
               calls to mind thy faith.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>If then these that were against thee are on thy side: this is a great thing that thy
               persecutors have become thy heralds,</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Death: I confess, O Evil One, that as usury: I lay up the King’s treasures, till His
               Coming.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: I, O Death, rather deny that this belongs to God: this treasure of subtlety,
               which I have stored.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>Death: Thy coinage is fraudulent, then, O <persName>Satan</persName>: that into the treasuries of God, is not
               received.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: A new coinage do I coin, in kingly wise: lo! my merchantmen bring loss, into the
               world.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>God created everything out of nothing: and I created great sin out of nothing</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Death: Closed and bound be thy mouth, Evil One, who art thus bold: to set thyself, lo!
               in comparison with the Creator.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: To me, O Death, it is lawful to dare and speak: thy tongue, even thine, is a
               slave, and under fear.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Death: A gulf is henceforth between us, O <persName>Satan</persName>: for madly against thy Lord, lo! thou
               assailest.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab><persName>Satan</persName>: Wherefore doubtest thou, O Death, of our concord? Be to us comrade and member:
               and lo! we reign.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>Come, draw we our pair of swords, against mankind: I secretly, thou openly, and lo!
               we end them.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>Sin and <placeName>Sheol</placeName> they too gave counsel to those two: saying <quote>“If ye be divided, ye are
               undone.”</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>See the waters how if dispersed, they run low: but if gathered they gain strength,
               and thus ye likewise.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>If divided ye perish, as the feeble: but yoked together ye reign, as the mighty.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>Love melts down many, as in a furnace: and makes one powerful mass, that overcomes
               all.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>In it are wisdom and cunning, and force and power: it is greater far than an image of
               sixty cubits.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>Be reconciled, let us assemble and go, against that party: which if it be at one can
               never be defeated.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab>These things the troublers discoursed, and gathered and came: Thy day, Lord, will
               gather them, into <!--I think gehenna is hebrew? --> Gehenna.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="24">
            <ab>Through Thy mercy, Lord, will I worship Thee, when I have risen: at Thy trumpet I
               will praise Thy Son, when I am purged.</ab>
