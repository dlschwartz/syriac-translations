            <ab>Thou who answerest to the name of Abraham, in that Thou art made father of many; but
               because to Thee none is spouse, as Sarah was to Abraham,—lo! Thy flock is Thy spouse;
               bring up her sons in Thy truth; spiritual children may they be to Thee, and the sons
               be sons of promise, that they may become heirs in Eden. </ab>

            <ab>Fair fruit of chastity, in whom the priesthood was well pleased, youngest among Thy
               brethren as was the son of Jesse; the horn overflowed and anointed Thee, the hand
               alighted and chose Thee, the Church desired and loved Thee; the pure altar is for Thy
               ministry, the great throne for Thy honour, and all as one for Thy crown. </ab>

            <ab>Lo! thy flock, O blessed one, arise and visit it, O diligent one! Jacob ranged the
               flocks in order; range Thou the sheep that have speech, and enlighten the
               virgin-youths in purity, and the virgin-maids in chastity; raise up priests in
               honour, rulers in meekness, and a people in righteousness. </ab>

            <ab>Guard thou the sheep that are whole, and visit them that are sick, and bind up them
               that are broken, and seek out them that are lost; feed them in the pastures of the
               Scriptures, and give them drink or the spring of doctrine: let the truth be a wall
               unto thee, let the cross be a staff unto thee, and truthfulness be peace unto thee.

               plucked a straying lamb, from the mouth of the lion, how meet is it for Thee, O
               exalted one, to be zealous to snatch from the Evil One the souls that are precious
               above all, for by nothing can they be bought, save by the blood of Christ! </ab>

            <ab>Unto Moses Joshua ministered, and for the reward of his ministry, from him received
               the right hand. Because to an illustrious old man thou hast ministered, he too gave
               thee the right hand. Moses committed unto Joshua, a flock of which half were wolves;
               but to thee is delivered a flock, whereof a fourth yea a third is sanctified. </ab>

            <ab>Let the love of Moses abide in thee, for his love was a discerning love, his zeal a
               discreet zeal. When Korah and Dathan sundered themselves, he sundered the earth from
               beneath them; by sundering he made the sundering to cease. In Eldad and Medad he made
               known, that his good will was altogether this that all the people should prophesy.

            <ab>The poor estate of Elijah, Elisha loved above wealth; a poor man gave to a poor man,
               a gift that was great above all. Because thou hast loved the poverty, of thy master
               who in secret was rich, the fountain of his words shall flow from thee, that thou
               mayst become a harp for the Spirit, and mayst sing to thyself inwardly His good will.

               angered by the rebuke, for thy word sows peace; there is none terrified by thy voice,
               for pleasant in thy visitation; there is none that groans against thy yoke, for it
               labors instead of our neck, and lightens the burden of our souls. </ab>

               with the wrathful; catch them that are evil by them that are good, and them that
               spoil by them that give, and the defiled by means of the sanctified. </ab>

               diseased offer medicine, and to him that is sound a preservative; not one medicine
               only shalt thou offer, for the sickness lest haply it be not meet: offer many
               remedies, that the sickness may find healing; likewise thou shalt learn experience.

               jealous over you with jealousy, with a jealousy verily of God, not of the flesh but
               of the spirit. Be jealous therewith thou also in pureness, that He may know what she
               is and whose she is. In thee may she cherish, and in thee may she love, Jesus the

               for according to the face that gazes into it, thus does it put on the likeness
               thereof. For as is the king so also his host, and as is the priest so also his flock;
               according as these are it is stamped on them. </ab>

            <ab>Without a testament they departed, those three illustrious priests; who in
               Testaments used to meditate, those two Testaments of God. Great gain have they
               bequeathed to us, even this example of poverty. They who possessed nothing the

            <ab>The priest Jacob the noble, with him she was ennobled as he was: because he joined

               bounty, for money she redeemed the captives. With Valgesh a scribe of the law, her
