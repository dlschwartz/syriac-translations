         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>Hear, O Freedom, the dispute of two servants: how they are convicted by each other,
               that they are powerless.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Response: To Thee be glory by Whose humiliation Adam was exalted: and by Whose death he was
               raised, and regained Eden!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>If then the Evil One overcome thee, great is the shame: Death his comrade has
               convicted him, as being weak.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>And if again Death subdue thee, lo! what reproach: for the Evil One his comrade
               derides him, as but a shadow.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Their dispute is for thee a mirror, wherein thou mayest see: that they both are but
               as chaff, before thy breath.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>Yea and Prophets and Apostles, in their promises: assure thee that they like flowers,
               shall fade at the rising.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>Satan: Thou, Death, art he whom they hate, the quick and dead: for every combination
               thou dissolvest, and destroyest.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>Death: It is not open death that kills, O Satan: thy death which is secret kills the
               sons of men.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>Satan: My name is not hateful as thine, for the angel: showed himself in Satan’s
               likeness to Balaam on the way.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Death: How fit is this thy name, O Satan: who hast erred and made unwary Adam err, from
               the way!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>Satan: Wander not like one ignorant, and lose thy cause: dispute, O Death, if thou are
               competent, for replying.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Death: I know that thou art wily, O Satan: so that thou out of sand canst twist a
               snare.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Satan: Thy disputing, Death, is ended: for he who is worsted: when his words fail and
               are ended, begins to rail.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>Death: Among all I am conqueror, and by thee am I worsted? Let Adam persuade thee whom I
               have overcome, O Satan!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>Satan: I am he who bound Adam, and cast him before thee: the mighty man whom my wiles
               had bound, thou didst come and subdue.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>Death: I am he who have been crowned anew, with a diadem in the world: for Adam, chief
               of the mighty, I hold captive in Sheol.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>Satan: I killed him by secret death, even Adam when he sinned: thou, Death, hast slain
               one that was dead, killed by me.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>Death: In thy desire to conquer, Evil One, thou hast made thyself hated: for thou art
               Death as well as Satan, and this seems a little thing to thee.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Satan: Thou hast then been silenced, Death, as a weakling: for neither in words nor in
               deeds, hast thou strength to stand.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>Death: It is for thy evil thou conquerest, O Evil One, if thou discernest: thy crown is
               wholly of shame, if thou perceivest.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>I shall be defeated and thou shalt be cursed, O Satan: it is well for me to be
               ignorant, and not mischievous.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>Blessed be the Just One who divided them, though they were quite of one mind: Blessed
               be the Good One who made us of one mind, when we were divided.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab>I will overcome the Evil One through Thy forgiveness, O All-Merciful: and I shall
               overcome death through Thy Resurrection, O All-Life-giver!</ab>
