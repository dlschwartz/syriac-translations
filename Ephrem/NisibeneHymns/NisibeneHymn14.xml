         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>Under the three pastors,—there were manifold shepherds;—the one mother that was in
               the city,—had daughters in all regions.—Since Wrath has destroyed her
               dwellings,—Peace shall build up her churches. </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="response">
            <ab>Response: Blessed be He who chose out those three!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>The kindly labour of the first,—bound up the land in her affliction:—the bread and
               wine of the next,—healed the city when site was broken:—the sweet speech of the
               last,—sweetened our bitterness in affliction.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>The first tilled the land with his labour,—he rooted out of her the briars and
               thorns:—the next fenced her round about,—he made a hedge for her of them that were
               saved:—the last opened the garner of his Lord,—and sowed in her the words of her
               Lord.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>The first priest by means of a fast,—closed up the doors of men’s mouths:—the second
               priest for the captives,—opened the mouths of the purse:—but the last pierced through
               the ears,—and fastened in them the ornament of life.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Aaron stripped off from the ears,—the earrings and made a calf.—That lifeless calf
               in secret,—pierced and slaughtered the camp:—those who had fashioned his horns, —he
               ripped them up with his horns.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>But our priest who was the third,—pierced through the ears of the heart:—and
               fastened there the earrings he had fashioned,—of the nails that were fixed in the
               cross, —whereon his Lord was crucified,—and gave life to His fellow-men.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>A son unto death the fire brought forth;—Death feeds upon all bodies:—the son of
               Death who surpassed Death,—upon the souls of men he fed.—The calf forsook his
               provender,—for men’s minds were the food for him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>To the first Tree that which killed,—to it grace brought forth a son.—O Cross
               offspring of the Tree,—that didst fight against thy sire!—The Tree was the fount of
               death;—the Cross was the fount of life.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>The son that was born to Death,—all mouths were opened to curse him.—He devoured
               bodies and souls,—and multiplied the disgrace of his father.—But the Cross caused to
               pass away the rebuke,—of its father that first Tree.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>The two sons were even as were—the two mothers that bare them.—The calf which the
               fire brought forth,—the fire consumed in the midst of the people:—the Cross the
               offspring of grace,—divided good gifts to all creation.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>O my tongue hold thy peace and be silent of the histories of the Cross that press to
               be told!—for my mind of a sudden has conceived,—and lo! pangs of travail smite it:—it
               has conceived these among the last,—and they strive to become the firstborn.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>The babes struggled in the womb;—the elder made haste to come forth:—the younger
               desiring the birthright,—laid his hand upon his heel;—that which he obtained not by
               birth,—he obtained by the mess of pottage.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>After the like sort these later histories,—lo! they make light of the former
               ones,—that themselves may come forth and take the birthright.—Let us bring forth the
               history of our fathers,—for lo! the histories of the Cross—are the firstborn of all
               creatures.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>For if that which has no beginning—is the first of all created things,—its histories
               also are the firstborn,—for they are elder than all creatures.—Let the histories of
               Thee, O my Lord, yield place,—that we may tell of Thy ministers!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>The first in degree of doctrine,—His eloquence was like as was his degree;—the next
               who was second in degree,—his interpretation mounted to the height of his degree;—the
               last who was third in degree,—his eloquence was great as he was.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>The first in his simple words,—gave milk unto his infants;—the next in his plain
               sayings,—gave victual to his children;—the third in his perfect sayings,—gave meat to
               his that were of perfect age.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>She too the daughter of instruction,—mounted from degree to degree,—along with her
               teachers and fathers.—A young child she was with the first; a simple maid was she
               with the next;—she came to perfect age in the third.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <ab>The first dealing with her as a child,—loved her and taught her to fear;—the next as
               with a damsel, rebuked her and make her glad;—the third as with one fully
               instructed,—was to her a solace of pleasantness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <ab>Even the Most High with the daughter of Jacob,—gave blandishment and the rod to her
               childhood;—and in her frowardness and full age,—gave part in the sword and the
               Law;—and according to her discipline and instruction,—He came to her in mildness and
               pleasantness.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <ab>The first that begat the flock,—his bosom bare her infancy;—the next of glad-some
               countenance,—cheered with song and made glad her childhood;—the last grave of
               countenance,—lo! he guards her chastity in her youth.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="21">
            <ab>The first priest who begat her,—gave milk to her infancy;—the next priest
               interpreted,—and gave victual to her childhood;—the third priest nourished her, and
               gave meat to her perfect age.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="22">
            <ab>The wealthy father who was first,—laid up treasures for her childhood;—the next for
               her maturity—multiplied provision for her journey;—the third the goodly olive
               tree,—multiplied oil in her vessels.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="23">
            <ab>When she comes before Him who is rich,—she will show the treasure of the first;—when
               she comes before the Saviour, she will show the saved ones of the next;—when she goes
               forth to meet the Bridegroom,—she will show the oil of her lamps.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="24">
            <ab>Before Him who rewards the weary toilworn,—she will offer the labour of the
               first;—before Him who loves cheerful givers,—she will show the almsgiving of the
               next;—before Him who judges doctrines,—she will offer the discourse of the last.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="25">
            <ab>And I the sinner who have striven to be—the disciple of these three,—when they shall
               see Him of the Third Day,—that he has closed the door of His chamber,—may these three
               pray Him for me, that He keep the door open a little while for me!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="26">
            <ab>May the sinner press into and enter—rejoicing and fearing to behold!—May the three
               masters call in—the one disciple in their grace!—May he gather up under the table—the
               crumbs that are full of life!</ab>
