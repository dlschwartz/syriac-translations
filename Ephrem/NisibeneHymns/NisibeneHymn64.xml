         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>O feeble ones, why weep ye, over your dead: who in death are at rest from sorrows and
               sins?</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Response: Glory to Him Who endured all, for the sake of all men: yea tasted death for the
               sake of all, to bring all to life</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>I reveal unto you, that even Satan, though much content: at your weeping, yet laughs
               much, at your mourning.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>In mockery he winks at me and nods to me, as a jester: <quote>Come let us laugh at sinners,
               for lo! they are mad.</quote></ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Truly they have given up remembrance of that fire, which I have hidden for them: and
               lo! the fools are drunken with weeping, for their departed.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>Instead of weeping as though, without provision: I had plundered and sent forth their
               dead, lo! they are mad.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>The souls of the evil are to be afflicted, till the judgment day: and these weep over
               the graves, like to madmen.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>They care not for their own sins, that haply to-morrow: they must go in shame of
               face, to join their dead.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <ab>And thus shall all be put to shame alike, family by family: in Sheol the wretches
               shall repent without avail.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <ab>Leave the drunken and the madman, until that day: wherein each shall shake off his
               wine wherewith he was maddened.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <ab>I will go to gather them, like children: that they may play the wanton and the
               madman, until they perish.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <ab>Lo! I have revealed to you the mystery, the secret of my comrade: go forth therefore,
               depart, amend, in repentance.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <ab>Leave me, I too will depart, I will see to my affairs: that with open face I may give
               my account to my Lord.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <ab>I know that the wind as it blew, has borne away my words: for ye are the same whom I,
               ofttimes have proved.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <ab>I remember Jeremiah how he, compared boldness: to the Indian who changes not his
               skin, though it is of freedom.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <ab>For this too belongs to it, even to freedom: that it binds itself by the will, as
               though by nature.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <ab>For so powerful is the will, in them that are free: that it may be likened to nature,
               through its workings.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></ab>
         </div>
         <noteGrp>
            <note xml:id="n1">I.e. though boldness is matter of free will, it becomes a second
               nature.</note>
