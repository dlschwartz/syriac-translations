         <div type="section" n="1">
            <ab>The Evil One perceived his great humiliation, and boasted himself in the presence of
               his servants: he spoke great words to persuade them and said: <quote>The knowledge
                  which I possess, little of it is by nature; and much of it, yea all of it, is by
                  learning. I to myself have been master, and have exercised my understanding.
                  Without a teacher I have learnt all; I have armed myself with every weapon, and
                  have won by it the crown which I desired among mankind.</quote>
            </ab>
         </div>
         <div type="resopnse">
            <ab>Response: Blessed is He that has come and undone the snares of sin!</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <ab>Among the Pharisees I clothed myself in hatred, that I might contend with Him, even
               the Son of Mary. Wrath like a bow rained shafts; boldness railed upon Him; fury
               rebelled against Him; ingratitude slandered Him; envy and jealousy in their wrath,
               strove with Him; and blasphemy took up stones. The Healer came in and stood among the
               sick, and I stirred up the diseased in contention against Him.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <ab>Because He fell not under reproach, it was in questions that I took refuge. Many
               times did I stir up occasions, but I saw that my falsehood was rebuked, and my
               impudence was made known, and my vain babbling was despised. To the windings of
               contention I betook myself. Everywhere that I disputed with Him, all my labor was as
               chaff, and the word of truth scattered it on every side.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <ab>I saw that there is a warrior and a mighty lord, in cunning within man: [and the
               snake that is without makes it fear.] His lusts within him is coiled continually; his
               jealousy hisses like a serpent. Deadly desires he begets, and of a fever he is in
               dread. Command as a drug, is able to quell derision, which smites unto destruction.
               It is love that avails to break the sting secret and bitter of the tongue.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <ab>Who is more foolish than men, who rather than for himself cares for his dwelling!
               The garments that are in his chest he examines daily, and a worm is lurking in his
               members. The rents that are in his clothes he mends, but a rent is made in his soul.
               His house is lighted up but his heart is dark. He shuts up his senses but opens his
               windows. He closes his door and guards his money; his mouth is open and the treasure
               of his thought is stolen.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <ab>The fool makes more of his beasts than of himself, for he cares for his possessions
               rather than for his soul. Good seed he sows in his ground; in his heart he sows
               tares. His understanding is thrown open and cast down; but at the fences of his
               vineyard he labours. He chooses and plants vine-plants; while his mind is a vine of
               the vines of Sodom. He keeps off the wild ass from his sowing; but the wild boar of
               the wood devours his thoughts.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <ab>I am a furnace to the sons of men, and in me are tried their counsels. Therefore is
               it lawful to me to weave deceit. I teach the Chaldean art: by reason of the true
               things that befall, the false things are believed. In the midst of Egypt I closed
               men’s eyes; I showed insects, men thought they were though they were not. By closing
               men’s eyes I teach the signs of the Zodiac, though they are not in the heavens.</ab>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <ab>By reason of my swiftness I fly and see, and I show beforehand to the soothsayer;
               they who err concerning me count me a prophet. But sometimes I make bold; and I ask
               that for an hour, secret things be revealed to me, that true men may be proved by me
               even as Job, likewise deceivers as Saul. For the one I revealed his sorcery; and for
               the other I purged his truth and he was praised.</ab>
