            This blessed Simeon then used to go about on the mountains like the
            wild beasts, and these the rugged mountains of towering height with valleys
            between them which are called the inner Karhe'; and he had no intercourse
            except that with God, while at every moment he would raise his eyes to
            heaven, and be lost in ecstatic wonder at the hosts above, how they stand
            continuously before God without impediment, and that there is no cessation
            in their song of praise even for a short space. And he would often in my
            presence say these things: <quote>Wherefore do we wretched men,
               who were created for the same expression of praise in like manner as these, and to
               whom a mouth has been given and a tongue and power of speech, cease
               from the praise of the merciful Creator, and busy ourselves with the vain
               <pb n="230"/>things of this false and deceitful world? A great thing it is how our heart
               is sunk and our mind blinded, and we do not consider the bounties of him
               who created us, and brought us into existence out of nothing, how we, feeble
               dust of the earth, <quote>live and move and exist</quote>', how the good Creator gave us
               the breath of this pure air (ano) to sustain our life without anxiety, how he
               put together for us an organ (õpravov) for speech, and a voice and a mouth
               and lips and a tongue and a palate, how he infused light into the pupils of
               our eyes, that it might be an informant and a director to the whole body,
               how again he bestowed hearing in the ears and breath in the nostrils, and
               understanding in the heart, that by means of its perceptions it might know
               and discern creation which declares him; and, again, that he always gives
               aliment also in all varieties for the sustenance of the body, and again to the
               soul also besides, in accordance with its nature and after the pattern of its
               airiness, he gave spiritual life according to its spirituality, and again besides
               these things his grace like a watchful guardian stands carefully over our life
               by night and by day and delivers and guards us from mishaps and from all
               detriment that evil things may chance to do, and while this our merciful
               <pb n="231"/>Creator performs all these gracious acts in relation to us, and gave us all
               these spiritual and bodily gifts, our wretched heart is sunk in the mire of
               sin, and neglects to give thanks for these things. For we truly ought not
               only to thank and praise him who created us as the angels do, but even many
               times more than these, even as his care for us too is manifestly many times
               greater than his care for them. And why again do we look at things that
               are small? But let us regard with greater astonishment the thing that is
               greater and more marvellous than all, and passes all bounds and all measures,
               that God himself in his love descended from heaven to earth for our salvation,
               and sacrificed himself on the cross for our sake, and gave us his living and lifegiving body and blood to eat and to drink, and further promised us in his
               kindness invisible blessings. And how do we not much more than the angels
               owe thanks for great kindnesses such as these, which our good Creator and
               merciful God performed in relation to us?</quote> While this blessed man was
            saying all these things with ecstatic wonder, he was filling all his hearers
            with similar wonder, while, his mind being uplifted by ecstatic contemplation
            of the glories of the heavenly beings, he said many things beside that are
            greater than these. And the occasion which called him to enter the limits
            <pb n="232"/>of men's habitation and say these things to them was as follows. In
            earlier times he used to spend eight months on the mountains among caves
            and rocks, and for the four severe winter months he would come down to a
            monastic convent which he knew to be convenient for his occupation, on
            account of the hardness of the winter and the severity of the snow. But
            once, while going round from mountain to mountain, he chanced to be on
            rough mountains near the river Euphrates, belonging to the village of
            ʾbdhyr' on the Euphrates, a village which lies and makes a boundary (?) with
            the territory of Claudias?; and he saw that, though these mountains were
            rugged and towering, houses and domestic brood-animals (?)' were scattered
            over them all, while they were some five miles and some seven, and some
            as much as eight and ten from the village; because the boundary of that
            village is so extended (and it is itself also populous) that other hamlets are
            settled from it within its boundaries.
         </p>
         <p>
            The blessed Simeon was amazed to see in what a rugged mountainous
            district human beings were living, and moreover that they possessed houses
            <pb n="233"/>and cattle and were settled there in confidence (one being three miles distant
            from his neighbour, and another five and another two according to chance),
            and he was also astonished that all the mountains were so full of people;
            and then, seeing some shepherds at a distance from the houses, he came near
            and inquired' from them the causes of this scattered character of this place
            of habitation, because there are there not only cattle-sheds such as some
            men make, but great houses and substantial dwellings. But the shepherds
            would state to him, <quote>We found our fathers living in this way on these
               mountains; and, inasmuch as we were born on them, lo! we also live on
               them.</quote> And again he would ask them, <quote>How then, as you live on these
                  mountains, are you able to assemble in God's house, and to hear his word
                  from the holy Scriptures, or to communicate in the mysteries of his body
                  and blood?</quote> But these men, like some wild beasts, upon these words
            laughed at the blessed man, and they say: <quote>How, blessed sir, does the
               oblation that a man receives profit him? For what is the oblation?</quote>. When
            the blessed man heard these words, his bones shook from his fright and his
            <pb n="234"/>tears gushed out, and he said to them: <quote>Tell me, my sons, are you Christians
               or Jews?</quote>. But they were indignant at these words, and they say: <quote>O!
                  indeed, blessed man, we are Christians, do not call us Jews.</quote> The blessed
            man says to them: <quote>And, if you are Christians, how is it that you have
               mocked at God and said of his living and holy body and blood in which our
               life and our souls' salvation consists, <quote>What does it profit us?</quote> or <quote>For what is
                  it?</quote>? How is it that you were not frightened to perform with your tongues
               the acts of pagans and Jews, when you are as you say Christians?</quote>. They,
            when they saw the awe with which he expressed himself, became afraid
            themselves also, and they say: <quote>Forgive us, sir, for we have no knowledge.</quote>
            He says to them: <quote>And have you not heard the Scriptures, my sons?</quote>.
            They say to him: <quote>From our fathers we have heard; but the Scriptures
               themselves we have not seen.</quote> Now those who were speaking to the
            blessed man were as he used to state to us about thirty years old.
            to them again: <quote>Are you, my sons, only in this state, or are all who are
               living on these mountains the same?</quote>. They say to him: <quote>Sir, it is not
                  <pb n="235"/>only we who are so, but there are men on these mountains which you see
                  wbo, unless they have heard from their fathers, who carried them to church
                  and had them baptized, do not know what a church is. And this same thing
                  happens now also to those who have children born to them; on their account
                  they go into a church and have them baptized; otherwise none of us has
                  entered a church since he was born; but we live on these mountains like
                  animals.</quote> The blessed man marvelled and wept, and said to them: <quote>Well
                     have you said <quote>like animals</quote>, my sons. For animals are much better than
                     you; since these have remained as the Creator created them, without changing
                     or being ungrateful to or blaspheming against their Creator; and for this
                     reason they do not come to judgment. But, as for you, God created you in
                     his image and in his likeness, and gave you his body and blood for the life
                     and salvation of your souls, and you have deprived yourselves of eternal life,
                     and have become very wild, surpassing the animals. And now what hope
                     have you toward God? for lo! you are unaware even of what Christianity
                     is.</quote> And, having spoken with them and warned them, he left them and
            departed. And, being troubled in his thoughts, he would say to himself,
            <pb n="236"/>as he himself declared, <quote>How is it that these men are like animals on these
               mountains?</quote>. Then he considered, and he said in his heart as if from God,
            <quote>Perhaps it was indeed for this reason that God's grace led me to the
               mountains here, in order that there may be salvation for these souls that are in
               the darkness of error.</quote> And the blessed man became enthusiastic, saying,
            <quote>God wishes for the salvation of all these people more than mine. Henceforth 
               I will not withdraw from this place, unless these have been gained for
               God; since they are bound in error, and are as if they were not Christians.
               What pagan is there, or what other worshippers of creation, who for so
               long a period of time would neglect to pay honour to the object of his
               worship, and would not always worship that which is reckoned by him
               as God? These men neither worship God like Christians, nor honour
               something else like pagans; and they are apostates against the one and
               against the other.</quote> As he was going about, he found a kind of village on
            the same frontier the name of which was Mʿrbnʾ; and he resolved to
            approach this village, and learn what its condition also was. And on
            approaching he saw in it a little church overshadowed with vines, and he
            rejoiced, and said: <quote>Lo! here there is a sign of the presence of Christians.</quote>
            <pb n="237"/>And, when he had come up to it, he went in and saw that it was full of
            wood and stones and dust; and the blessed man wept bitterly. But, some
            men from the village having seen an old anchorite enter the church, one
            of the old men came up to him, and received his blessing; and the
            blessed man asked him, <quote>Is there a priest here?</quote>. He said to him:
            <quote>There has not been a priest here during these times.</quote> And he asked
            him again: <quote>And not even a brother' or anyone whatever?</quote>. He said
            to him, <quote>There is none here.</quote> Again he went on to ask him also,
            <quote>Where do you receive the oblation?</quote>. He says to him: <quote>If one of us
               has business and has happened to be present in one of these villages, he
               receives; if not, no one here has this concern for the oblation.</quote> He says
            to him: <quote>And wherefore have you no priests?</quote>. He says to him, <quote>It is
               not our custom.</quote> He says to him: <quote>And how are you Christians, when
                  you do not follow the custom of Christians?</quote>. After conversing with
            him in this fashion he says to him: <quote>Come let us sweep out and tidy up
               this church, for I wish to take up my abode in it for a few days.</quote> And
            they swept and scoured (?)? and tidied. And he said to him: <quote>Gather
               together for me to-morrow all the souls that are in this hamlet, men and
               <pb n="238"/>women and children, and small as well as great.</quote> And on hearing about
            some strange sight that they had never seen they assembled together before
            him in the morning; and he conversed with them in words of admonition,
            and said to them: <quote>Wherefore, O men, do you hold your lives in contempt
               and take no thought for the salvation of your souls? Wherefore, when God
               formed us in his image, do we on our part live animal lives outside the
               orderliness of men? Know you not that you are men, and not animals?
               know you not that even the animals have a greater blessing than you, they
               who are not destined to rise, nor yet to enter the judgment of justice?
               Know you not that the dread judgment of God's justice is at hand? and know
               you not that you are destined to stand before the dread tribunal (Bip.x) of
               God? Wherefore then do you make yourselves like the animals on the
               mountains? and wherefore are you like them delivered indiscriminately to
               death, in that you hold aloof from hearing God's word, and are moreover
               deprived of the communion of the venerated body and blood of God, and this
               is not reckoned by you as anything?</quote>. While the blessed man was repeating
            such words to them, like some irrational animal, which when a man speaks
            <pb n="239"/>to it in order that it may be instructed only hears and looks at him, so they
            also heard what he was speaking, and looked at him in astonishment, and
            they had nothing to say. But he again said to them: <quote>Do you not speak?</quote>.
            They said to him: <quote>What, sir, can we say to you? There is no one to say
               anything to us or teach us: and this which you say has never reached our
               ears; since we do not know the Scriptures.</quote> He says to them: <quote>know
                  you not that our Lord Jesus Christ came down from heaven, and clothed
                  himself in our body from a Virgin for our salvation, and consorted with men
                  as a man? are you aware of these things, or not?</quote>. The old men among
            them say to him: <quote>Yes, sir, we hear the things</quote>. He says to them
            <quote>Do you hear only without knowing the truth? Know you not moreover
               that God suffered for our sake, and was suspended on the cross, and was
               fastened with nails and his side was pierced by a lance and blood and water
               flowed from him as a propitiation for men, and that he died and by his death
               slew our death, and rose after three days, it is written and raised us with
               him, having trodden the road and shown us the resurrection that shall be ours,
               and before he suffered broke his body and blood' in an upper room and
               <pb n="240"/>blessed it and gave it to his disciples and said, <quote>This is my body that is
                  broken on behalf of the life of the world for the forgiveness of sins</quote>', and
               again that he said before, <quote>Everyone who eateth my body and drinketh my
                  blood, he abideth in me and I in him, and I will raise him at the last day</quote>2?
               How then, when you have heard all these things and know them, as you say,
               do you treat them with contempt and pay no regard to your souls' life, and
               remain deprived of the word of life in the holy Scriptures, and hold aloof
               from the communion of Christ's body and blood, and do not consider that any
               loss falls upon you from this, whereas you suffer not loss of some small thing,
               but utter destruction of your souls?</quote>. They said to him: <quote>And what, sir,
                  can we do?</quote>. But he laid a kind of penance upon them all, admonishing
            them and explaining to them, <quote>Because your souls are waste and barren by
               reason of your neglect, like soil that is barren on account of the length of
               time during which thorns and briars have been springing up in it, so that a
               man who wishes to till it first plucks up these thorns and burns them, and
               then puts in his seed, so do you also go and fast this week and and pray, and
               <pb n="241"/>break bread on the first day of the week, and bring it me; and all of you,
               great and small, meet together, and come and present yourselves</quote>. And
            they consented to his proposal, and went and fasted, and came. He says to
            them: <quote>Wherefore have your sons not been made sons of the covenant',
               and been instructed and placed in this church, and been making you hear
               God's word?</quote>. They say to him: <quote>Sir, they have not time to leave the goats
                  and learn anything</quote>. The blessed man, marvelling at the people's simpleness
            and carelessness, made the oblation, and communicated them; and then they
            opened their mouth, and began to give thanks to God who sent him to them;
            while he laid an injunction upon them that they should meet together every
            first day of the week, keeping themselves from blasphemy and from fornication, 
            and from murder; because none of them reckoned the blood of a man,
            either of his neighbour or of a stranger, as worth one locust, and there was
            none to require it; but the blessed man made an inquiry into these things,
            and everyone in whose case he learned that this thing had taken place he
            deprived of Christian fellowship, and they were set apart as pagans and Jews.
            And then they began to feel a little fear, both of God and of the blessed man
            himself, while he continued sending and fetching all who were on the
            <pb n="242"/>mountains to the house, and converting them afresh, as if from paganism;
            and thus he used to gather them all together like wild animals. After a short
            time, when he had gained information about the children of each one of them,
            who had male children and who female, and how many each of them had,
            while they were unaware of his purpose, what he intended to do, he gave the
            order <quote>Next first day of the week see that no persons stay away from the
               congregation</quote>; and he sent to the mountains, saying, <quote>Let the little children
                  also be present in the congregation</quote>. When they assembled and came
            according to his instructions (since they were indeed afraid of him), he
            provided himself with a razor, both himself and a certain man who was in the
            secret who knew them well, and, when all had received the oblation, he said
            to them: <quote>Allow all the little ones to receive a present' to-day, and we will
               bless them and speak with them, and they shall come; since to these from
               to-day someone must always speak the word of God, that thus they may
               remember it as long as they live; and do you go everyone in peace</quote>. And
            they believed it, and went away, having induced the little ones to remain by
            these words, <quote>You will receive presents, and we will mix them for you?.
               Remain all of you</quote>. Then they all remained, about ninety, males and
            <pb n="243"/>females. And he shut the doors, and came up and separated and arranged
            them with the help of the man who knew them, separating one in three, and
            the females moreover on the same system'; and, if there were two females
            and one male, he would take one of the former; and so also with the males
            too, and if again there were two?, he would in the same way take one of
            them; and he separated thirty of them and set them on one side, eighteen
            boys, and twelve girls; and the rest he led away and shut up in another room,
            lest they should go and report what had happened. And he brought them
            up before the altar, and shut the inner and outer doors, and made a prayer.
            over them, and the two began to tonsure them, soothing them with
            blandishments; and of them some wept, and some were silent; and thus they
            shaved them boys and girls alike. And then he released the first lot who had
            been separated and not tonsured, having shown them their companions, that
            they might report to their parents what had happened, and they might
            come, and he might speak with them, and might appease those who were
            troublesome. When the news arrived, the women assembled with lamentations, 
            crying, <quote>Alas! what has taken place and what has befallen us?</quote>.
            And some were binding themselves under a curse, saying, <quote>My son shall not
               <pb n="244"/>again be shaven, and the name <quote>son of the covenant</quote> shall not again be
               called over him</quote>. And some of them from the rage of their souls even
            betook themselves to abuse of the blessed man; and so also the men. But
            he held his tongue, and he continues laughing till their wrath is pacified; and
            some of them acquiesced in what they had done, saying, <quote>Our Lord's will
               be done</quote>, and, <quote>We would it were so</quote>. But, when two of them stubbornly
            stood out, he exhorted and admonished them, and said to them: <quote>They are
               yours, my sons; they are not going to destruction; they are being presented
               to Christ, while they are yours</quote>. But they showed violent indignation,
            saying, <quote>We will not present one of them to Christ</quote>. But he testified to
            them, saying, <quote>I for my part have marked out this plot in Christ's name to
               his glory. Beware what you are doing. I am free from sin. He who
               separates a soul from it and takes it out that he may bring it back to the
               world, Christ' will not resign that soul in this bodily life, because it is bis
               and has been marked in his name. I for my part have testified to you; you
               know</quote>. But they came up, and laid their hands upon them and dragged
            them away and removed them, blaspheming. The blessed man says to them:
            <quote>Have mercy upon your souls, my sons, and do not be obstinate and deprive
               <pb n="245"/>yourselves of your children, and incur blame</quote>. They said: <quote>Let us be
                  deprived this evening and we will not make our children shavelings</quote>.
            He says to them: <quote>Beware, for, if you take them away, I for my part have
               testified, and I testify again, that neither of them will reach next first day of
               the week in this bodily life</quote>. They, when they heard it, jeered at the
            blessed man, saying: <quote>If you think that your curses are so well heard,
               go and curse these Huns who are coming and making havoc of creation',
               and let them die.</quote> And so they took their children away in good health,
            and went off; and within three days both of them were smitten and died.
            Then the terror of the blessed man fell upon everyone, when the power of his
            word and of his prayer upon those men was seen; and they also repented,
            and they went and fell down before him, weeping and saying, <quote>We have
               been presumptuous, sir, forgive us; lest you curse us also and we die</quote>.
            Then he said to them: <quote>I, my sons, did not curse these either (far be
               it!); but God took them away, that he might chastise you yourselves for
               your presumption against his word; since it was not in our name, but in
               the name of God himself and in his word that I marked them. And now
               <pb n="246"/>go repent and pray to God that he will forgive you, lest you also perish
               as well</quote>. And they in fear and entreating him departed. And from that
            time among all of them great and low, if the old man wished to tonsure
            anyone, there was none who presumed to speak; and thenceforth whoever
            pleased him he would mark and take away without impediment. But for
            those who had been tonsured he made tablets for writing, and wrote for
            them; and thus he would thenceforth frequently sit with patience as in a
            school (oxoan), and would teach them, boys and girls together. And down
            to the time when they reached an age at which they might receive harm
            from one another, within four or five years, they learned the psalms and the
            Scriptures; and thus thenceforward loud choirs were to be heard at the
            service, and all these mountains also had been brought into subjection, and
            they trembled to commit any breach of order, lest the old man should hear it
            and separate them from the fellowship of men, or that' he should curse
            them. And accordingly twenty-six years passed while he was there, and
            he was still in this life, and we were always receiving his blessing, and were
            also in intercourse with him”; and we used to learn from him about the
            <pb n="247"/>uncivilized character of that people and about their subjugation and about
            all the torments that they had inflicted on him, when he was now old and
            decrepit, and these disciples of his also had become grown women and men,
            and they were now becoming readers and daughters of the covenant, and they
            were themselves teaching others also as well. And accordingly the blessed
            man's name had gone out over all that country, and he was a law (vóuos) and
            a judge of the country; and every matter that was in need of reform was
            referred to him. And now, because feebleness and old age had overtaken
            him, he was no longer able to retire to the mountains outside according to
            his custom, but he used to carry out his labour there in the same country in
            his cell, and he had also gained possession of these men; and he was as a
            spiritual father to all of them, having also converted them from the error of
            their apostasy to proper rules of life both bodily and spiritual.
