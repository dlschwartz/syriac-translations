         <head>Next the Eighth History, of the Blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1116">Addai</persName> the <foreign>Chorepiscopus</foreign></head>
         <p>
            It is patent to everyone that salt does not itself need a condiment, because
            by its own nature it is a condiment, and, to put it differently, not a condiment
            only, but salted by its nature; and accordingly it does not need itself or
            make use of itself, but all other insipid ſoods need to use it as a condiment. But
            so also fair sketches which show the admirable form of the likenesses of the
            saints are not adapted for repetition to them, nor do they themselves need
            <pb n="125"/><pb n="125"/>these, but for us ourselves who are more insipid than food<note></note> the condiment
            of the stories of the saints is required. This blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1116">Addai</persName> then was
            <foreign>chorepiscopus</foreign> in a monastery in a village called Fardaisa?, at the approach to
            the Armenian frontier in the district called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2758">Anzetene</placeName><note></note>; and he had fittingly
            wielded the authority of the chorepiscopate for a considerable time with all
            religious conduct without blame, visiting the poor, and caring for the orphans,
            and providing for the widows, and admonishing the clerical staff in the
            churches and the monastic convents, going about and warning and teaching
            each man to devote himself sincerely to his ministry without stain in the
            sight of men, while his words to every man were always these: <quote>My sons,
               let us not despise the expressions of the great and divine <persName>Paul</persName>'. Let us
               hear from him that he cries to us as with a trumpet and says, <quote>My children,
                  it is the last time. And from this we understand that it is the last time, from
                  the false <persName>Christs</persName> who have come in among us</quote>; and again he says, <quote>The
                     end of all things hath come near</quote>', and again, <quote>The end of the times hath
                        come near upon us</quote>'. And for this reason, as men who read these things
               and meditate upon them always, let us conduct ourselves in the time of our
               <pb n="126"/><pb n="126"/>sojourning with fear'; because <quote>the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
                  the night</quote>", and the day of vengeance has come near", and the day of requital
               that requites every man according to his deeds' is at hand; and for this
               reason <quote>wake yourselves righteously, and sin not</quote>s Keep the purity of
               your persons and of your souls, as well as that of your bodies; and wake and
               devote yourselves to the service of him who called you and by his grace
               brought you to his holy order, and appointed you to praise him, because he
               will cause you to live at his coming; not because he himself needs our praise,
               but this is the will of his gracious mercy, through the praise of him to give
               glory to us</quote>. When therefore the rest of this blessed man's days he had
            spent in such warnings and in such earnest care toward every man, suddenly
            the smoke of the heretical persecution that had been exhaled over the whole
            empire reached him, and those who had been made fervent labourers for the
            impiety of the synod of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName> directed their steps to him as a chief and
            leader and man of eminence, requiring him to go to the man who held
            the authority in his metropolis<note></note>, and make concord with him, and accept
            communion in his apostasy; and, if on the other hand he did not do so, to be
            <pb n="127"/><pb n="127"/>driven into exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>). But the saint on hearing these things rejoiced; and
            he answered them, saying: <quote>Who then (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρα</foreign>) is there, pray, who will not
               take upon himself as you suppose (everyone who has sense in him) exile
               (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) with <persName>Christ</persName>? Now that <persName>Christ</persName> is being driven into exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) by
               you, would that we also may be banished by you rather than by becoming
               renegades with you be banished by him</quote>. When therefore the men who
            had been sent to him heard these things from him, they went on uttering
            great menaces against him in great wrath, threatening and saying, <quote>Prepare
               yourself to meet a fate that is in accord with your assertion; since you shall
               not live here longer, unless you make concord and signify acceptance
               according to the king's order</quote>. But he, when he heard these words, laughed
            at them, and said: <quote>If, pray, there had liappened to be a king who ordered
               me to sacrifice like the holy martyrs, would you on account of his order have
               urged me to obey him because he was king, and sacrifice to idols?</quote> Then
            the blessed man arose before them and gathered the inmates of his convent
            together, and spoke many words with them, saying, <quote>Let every man 
               beware</quote>. And he took his staff and went out, saying: <quote>Think not to
                  yourselves that, if I possessed the whole world, it would be more to me
                  <pb n="128"/><pb n="128"/>than the true faith in <persName>Christ</persName>. Lo! I have not taken even bread for the day
                  now that I am expelled from all this course of life in which I have run and
                  laboured and gathered' from my youth. It is better for me to die than
                  that anyone should make my boast in our Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> vain?</quote>. And so
            he departed and went up to the rugged towering mountains that are in
            the east of that district, in which nothing except great beasts is to be found
            on account of their inaccessibility; and he was there for a considerable time
            supporting himself on roots, and passing the nights in caves, and going about
            and praying, and weeping for the sheep of <persName>Christ</persName>'s innocent flock, how they
            had fallen into the hands of malignant apostate wolves. And, after a
            considerable time, the blessed man was seen by certain men, and news of him
            was heard; and the inmates of his monastery also sought for him carefully,
            and they discovered him; and he learned from them what had happened;
            because, after those who were conducting the persecution had seen that he
            himself had departed, they did not trouble themselves much about his
            monastery, but took all the plunder that they could from it, and left it. And,
            when he learned these things, he continued enjoining them to provide for
            the poor and the orphans and the widow's out of the remnant that had been
            left to them. But he, on account of the ruggedness of the mountains and
            <pb n="129"/><pb n="129"/>the unbounded amount of snow that covered them, went down to the
            neighbourhood of a certain hamlet that was situated among these same
            mountains, and made a cell for himself, and there he used to pass the winter.
            But after five years during which he had lived in this manner, busying himself
            about providing for the poor, his monastery was brought to indigence; and,
            when he knew that it had been plundered more than ten times, and no longer
            contained provision for the needy as before, and the blessed man was
            grieved and distressed on account of the starving and distressed persons
            for whom there was no method of providing, and further the inmates of his
            monastery also were pressed by want, then he considered <quote>There is no
               longer any quarter from which it is possible for me to provide for my brethren,
               except that the blessed men should come and make a vineyard in these
               mountains, and it will be a provision for them and for the needy</quote>. And this
            he did not delay to carry out; but when they came to him he spoke to
            them, and this suggestion pleased them. And they brought men and dug;
            and there in the first year they put in about twenty thousand<note></note>, and a like
            number also in the second, and the third; and the vineyard reached a great
            size on the mountains. And the news went out everywhere <quote>Such-and-such
               a monastery has covered the mountains with vineyards</quote>; and hence within
            five or six years so much wine was produced that they could not find vessels
            <pb n="130"/><pb n="130"/>to contain it. And, since the region of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2763">Cappadocia</placeName> was close at hand, and
            these men<note></note> used to go out as far as Syria and buy wine, they became aware
            of the place that was close to them, and from that time it became their habit
            to go out thither in companies and buy; and thenceforth the anxieties of the
            holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1116">Addai</persName> that had been troubling him because he had nothing in his
            possession wherewith to provide for the poor were much relieved, since he
            would send from forty and fifty denarii, and as many as came in from? that
            vineyard, and buy clothes and distribute them to the needy, and similarly
            also corn and oil, and many articles; so that, except what was needed for
            the cultivation of the vineyard itself, he left nothing whatever that he did
            not liberally bestow upon the distressed persons. And thus he completed
            twenty-five years in this occupation, while he did not go into the cultivated 
            territory or neglect this business, nor did men see him casually,
            but he would carry his staff the whole day, and go about among the gullies
            and ravines and among the trees, and would kneel and pray and weep,
            taking care that no one should pass behind him and surprise him; and so at
            evening-time he would betake himself to a certain place that he had secretly
            <pb n="131"/><pb n="131"/>made, and the man who attended him would meet him, and inform him in
            case anyone had come out to look for him. And thus he would do even in
            snow and frost, in order that he might not be seen by men; but he had given
            orders that everyone who came should be received and refreshed and go;
            so that in fact on one and two occasions I went up to these mountains to see
            the blessed man, and I did not see him with his consent. But on one occasion,
            because I knew the hour of his arrival, I took one of the brethren with me,
            and at eventide we betook ourselves to that place; and, as there was a thicket
            of many trees there, I said to the brother who was with me: <quote>Let us sit
               down among these trees, and lie in wait for the old man; since perhaps he
               will come and we shall catch him, and obtain his blessing</quote>. And, while we
            on our part were sitting down, lo! there comes the sound of his feet and
            of his breath as he was coming down from the mountain; and, when we saw
            him in the distance, we kept ourselves hidden all the more, lest he should see
            us and turn back; as in fact happened. When he had approached to about
            half a furrow's length<note></note> from us, though neither the sight of us nor the
            perception of our presence reached him, as if he scented the smell of
            us, he checked himself and halted, waiting a long time, while we on our
            side did not stand up and were not seen by him; and, as if he had become
            <pb n="132"/><pb n="132"/>aware of us in his spirit, he thereupon like a wild beast turned aside, and
            set his face to go down the mountain-side at a run. When I saw that the
            old man was running, I cried out: <quote>Forgive us, father, and pray for us</quote>.
            And, in order not to vex and annoy him, we did not pursue after him; and so
            we went in and passed the night, and we did not obtain a sight of the saint.
            But again, inasmuch as my mind was ardently bent on running and labouring 
            after the good and precious merchandise of the old man's blessing at all
            costs, even so I was not remiss in the matter, but also after a time again I
            directed my steps to these mountains, having determined, <quote>If I am here
               as much as two months, I will not depart from these mountains until I am
               blessed by the bondman of God</quote>, entreating our Lord to grant me this gift.
            And at noontide in the middle of the day we saw the old man passing over a
            certain clear space some distance off, and coming down from peak to peak,
            because there was a gap between; and we kept ourselves close lest he should
            see us and run away. And, because intense noonday heat prevailed, he
            stood and prayed, and next he knelt down, and he stood up and stretched out
            his hands to heaven, expanding himself in the form of a cross; and he
            continued for a long time until about the ninth hour<note></note>, and then he sat down
            <pb n="133"/><pb n="133"/>to rest for a short time. But we, when we saw that he had sat down to rest,
            came down by a certain deep gully, and went on until we arrived opposite
            the blessed man; and thus we suddenly came up and caught him. But when
            he saw us he was thunderstruck, as a man is frightened by the sudden sight
            of some lion; and, after he had looked this way and that and seen that there
            was no escape, he stood up and received us, and made a prayer. And he
            stood and asked, saying, <quote>Whence have you come hither, blessed men, on
               this mountain?</quote> We continued entreating him to sit down for a little time;
            but he did not consent to sit down, in order that he might not be involved
            in a long conversation with human beings; but he continued saying to us,
            a <quote>Go to the monastery and rest there, and lo! I will myself come at once</quote>.
            And, after we had begun many sentences, he continued urging this upon
            us, to go to the monastery, in order (as he professed) to rest, which was
            only that he might escape from us. But I, inasmuch as I divined his purpose, 
            said to him: <quote>Why, our father, do you run away from us? Sit down
               and speak, and console us with your aſſectionate words', and sow good seed
               in our ears, even if our own soil is ungrateful, and barren and unculti<pb n="134"/><pb n="134"/>vated</quote>.
            But he looked at me, and said: <quote>Do we then (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρα</foreign>), pray, seek
               another greater than <persName>Jesus</persName> to speak with us or to admonish us? and, if we
               do not obey him, if a man rise from the dead and speak, how shall we
               obey him?' Now go and rest, and I will come, and we will talk</quote>. But I
            inasmuch as I knew his purpose reflected that on account of the blessed
            man's pleasure we had been afraid of annoying him; and so we fell down
            before him and entreated him to bless us and to endow us with his holy
            prayers. But he when he dismissed us said to us: <quote>Do you pray for
               me the ungrateful. As for yourselves your earnestness signifies the direction 
               of your will, that God may mingle his will with your will, and make
               your will his will. Pray for me</quote>. And thus we parted, and we did not
            see the blessed man again; but sufficient for our consolation and for thanksgiving 
            to God to be ever rendered by us was this one occasion on which
            we were not deprived of the benefit of the sight of this divine man. After a
            period of twenty-five years, while spending his time in this way, he ended this
            life of troubles, and departed to the rest of his Lord, having committed the
            place of provision for the needy to the inmates of his convent, and enjoined
            <pb n="135"/><pb n="135"/>them to make provision from it for the needy, as during his life, for ever.
         </p>

            The history of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1116">Addai</persName> the <foreign>chorepiscopus</foreign> is ended.
