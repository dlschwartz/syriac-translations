         <head>Next the Tenth History, of the Brave Warrior on Behalf of The True Faith, Mar <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> the Bishop, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">the Persian Debater</persName>.</head>
         <p>
            When I approach the task of relating the history of this holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> the
            bishop, I do not do this in simplicity and without fear; because his character
            does not shine out in one beauty of righteousness only, that one might presume 
            to depict his virtue as one portrait, but in many beauties, the objectsm
            of great and inexpressible amazement, be they labours of righteousness, or
            humility exceeding the standard of those who live in these times, or zeal on
            <persName>Christ</persName>'s behalf, or the war which all his life until death he carried on against
            the fraudulent disciples of the school of Nestorius, or again his labour in all
            <pb n="138"/><pb n="138"/>countries in which the preaching of <persName>Christ</persName> had travelled; for whom, I think,
            it would not have been improper to speak with boldness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) like the
            holy <persName>Paul</persName> and say: <quote>I have toiled more than all</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n138-1"></ptr>, and to say further this
            also, that he had travelled not only from <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/104">Jerusalem</placeName> and as far as <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2797">Illyricum</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n138-2"></ptr>,
            but also in all countries in which the preaching of <persName>Christ</persName> had travelled, except
            only the territories of <placeName>Rome</placeName>; and thither also he was ready and had started
            to go, when God saw his venerable character and his old age and his labour,
            and ordered him to finish his course in the royal city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/586">Constantinople</placeName>.
            This holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> then even before the period of his episcopacy, besides
            the fervent zeal and enthusiasm for the true faith unto death which he
            possessed, was deeply versed in the Scriptures, and he was also ardent in
            practising debate, beyond (in my opinion) any other man, even the ancient
            fathers; because besides the gift of God this other fact too summoned him to
            it, because he was also a <persName>Persian</persName>, and he lived in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/526">Persia</placeName>, and it is in that
            country especially that the teaching of the school of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/780">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/655">Nestorius</persName>
            is very wide-spread, so that believing bishops and their dioceses are
            few there, and further besides this teaching that of the school of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/608">Mani</persName> and
            <pb n="139"/><pb n="139"/><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/616">Marcion</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3">Bar Daisan</persName> also had from this cause been much disseminated 
            there, and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/608">Mani</persName> travelled much there in the same country, and there
            also they flayed him alive, and he died there; and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3">Bar Daisan</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/616">Marcion</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n139-1"></ptr>, 
            because there was once a school (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολή</foreign>) of <persName>Persians</persName> at <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2605">Edessa</placeName>, and
            the <persName>Persians</persName> are in general keen inquirers, they were trained in the tenets
            of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3">Bar Daisan</persName> and of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/616">Marcion</persName> and became immersed in them; and they
            carried this evil plant down and planted it in that country; even as <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/534">Hibam</persName>
            the blasphemer who was once ruler there (of the church of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2605">Edessa</placeName>) made
            himself a promoter of that same school (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολή</foreign>); because this man not only
            blasphemed like Nestorius, but even surpassed him in wickedness. Whendai
            this bitter plant was spreading in the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2605">Edessa</placeName>, the holy bishop
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2253">Cyrus</persName> discovered it, and tore it out from its roots, and did not allow the
            school (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολή</foreign>) of the <persName>Persians</persName> to be mentioned there again, as had been
            the case before<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n139-2"></ptr>; and this school was from that time established in the
            city of Nisibis, from which all that country drink dregs of gall, so that
            even in this our country, the country of the <persName>Romans</persName>, some men taste of
            it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n139-3"></ptr>. Against these therefore the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> was always strongly armed
            <pb n="140"/><pb n="140"/>and ceaselessly contending; and wherever he came victory was given him
            by God, and he was made a closer of the mouth to all heretics (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αίρεσιώται</foreign>),
            until their chiefs or doctors dreaded to open their mouth and speak in a
            district in which his presence had been reported; because in a district in
            which a debate was being originated by the Nestorians against the believers 
            who were in it, if he were five or ten days' journey (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μανσίων</foreign>) away,
            as if God had made him ready and as if the earth had vomited him up,
            he would suddenly spring up and be present there<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n140-1"></ptr>, since from the
            greatness of his zeal and the fervour of his will he did not rest and sit still
            in one district, saying, <quote>I must not sit still and rest, when I know that
               <persName>Christ</persName>'s sheep are being scattered among ravening and destructive wolves,
               who will not spare to destroy them and tear them in pieces<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n140-2"></ptr></quote>. And for this
            reason he was sedulous in going out among the countries, as far as <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2792">the camp<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n140-3"></ptr> of the
               Saracens</placeName> of the tribe of Nuʿman, which he often visited; so
            that he gained a large number of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2792">Saracens</placeName> in it, and he induced the magnates
            who were converted by his words to build a Christian church in it. And
            again he would depart and go down to the very gate of the kingdom<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n140-4"></ptr>, and
            <pb n="141"/><pb n="141"/>would turn many to God not only among the heretics (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αίρεσιώται</foreign>!), but also
            among the <persName>Magians</persName>; so that he once even converted <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3618">three great and distinguished 
               men among the Magians</persName> and baptized them. And, when their
            companions heard that they had turned away from Magism and become
            Christians, they informed the king about them; and they received an order
            that, if they had really turned away and would not deny Christianity, they
            should die.
         </p>
         <p>
            But these men, who showed themselves worthy of a crown of life, when
            they saw the threat and the king's sword, were not afraid nor dismayed,
            while the blessed man also armed them with the enthusiasm of martyrdom
            for the sake of eternal life, and they resisted the order and the sword that
            had gone out against them; and they say, <quote>Far be it from us to deny the
               living God who made heaven and earth, and his Son the Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>,
               who called us and brought us near to him by his grace, that we should deny
               him again and worship instead of him the things that he created</quote>. Then
            ten days after their spiritual birth these blessed men departed to God by the
            quick death of the sword, bearing good testimony. But this blessed man
            continued to go out among the countries without ceasing, and to warn and
            make disciples and convert. And accordingly his fame went out over the
            whole land, and not only that of the <persName>Persians</persName> but that of the <persName>Romans</persName> also;
            <pb n="142"/><pb n="142"/>and he extended his travels to the royal city of the <persName>Romans</persName> for the first time
            for a reason like this.
         </p>
         <p>
            On one occasion <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3619">the Nestorian bishops</persName> of the chief cities met together
            and gave information to the king of the <persName>Persians</persName> about the believers in
            that country, saying, <quote>These men are traitors to your majesty, as it is
               in your power to learn, since their faith also and their rites agree with
               those of the <persName>Romans</persName></quote>; and the <persName>Magian</persName> believed them, and he ordered a
            persecution against the orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξοι</foreign>) in the whole of his kingdom.
         </p>
         <p>
            But the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> in the fervour of his zeal formed the plan of going
            up and informing the believing <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2265">Anastasius</persName>, king of the <persName>Romans</persName>, of these
            things, that he might do this favour to the church of the believers in the
            country of the <persName>Persians</persName>, saying, <quote>Who will be able to intercede with the king
               for us if I do not do these things? and that believing king will ask of him
               peace for the believers in the country of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/526">Persia</placeName></quote>. Then he quickly arrived
            before king <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2265">Anastasius</persName>, and informed him of these things. And this God-loving king, 
            because he was a believer and a friend of the believers, did
            not delay to carry out his request which he asked of him; and, because
            there was peace between them, and they were sending embassies to one
            <pb n="143"/><pb n="143"/>another<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n143-1"></ptr>, and royal presents and gifts, king <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2265">Anastasius</persName> then wrote earnestly
            to the <persName>Persian</persName>, saying: <quote>You will do well if you order that peace shall reign
               in your empire in your days; and in this matter you will gratify and please
               us, if your order keeps the Christian peoples in your empire unmolested,
               when you order that they shall not harm one another by reason of occasions
               of enmity, nor any of your people molest them</quote>. These words then that
            are in the king's letter together with others we have found that the holy
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> himself asked from him, and he gave him a copy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ίσον</foreign>) of them<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n143-2"></ptr>.
         </p>
         <p>
            And, when the envoy came down, he presented the request of the believing 
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2265">Anastasius</persName> to the king; and he consented and gave orders that none
            of the Christians should hurt his neighbour; and thenceforth the machinations 
            of the heretics were rendered of no effect, and the party of the believers
            enjoyed freedom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>). And the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> was more incited against
            the heretics, and was warmed with zeal for debating against their leaders
            <pb n="144"/><pb n="144"/>and doctors, insomuch that, wherever they asked him to debate, he would
            debate with them before an audience and would set up umpires to hear the
            discussion between them, and so he would debate and would refute them
            and put them to shame, so that on no single occasion was he defeated by them
            in debate. And therefore, if it happened that one of their bishops wished
            to originate a debate with any of the believers, he would first inquire<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n144-1"></ptr> from
            travellers, or from anyone who came in his way where <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> was, and then
            would speak, saying, <quote>Inquire<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n144-1"></ptr> and see as to the man whom they used also
               to call the invincible <persName>Satan</persName> <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> the debater where he is</quote>; so that once
            they were asking him himself<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n144-2"></ptr> about him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n144-3"></ptr>, because everywhere he was
            inflicting shame upon them, defeating and refuting them, and causing even
            the <persName>Magians</persName> to laugh at them, since he would often set up the <persName>Magians</persName>
            themselves as judges, and thus before them as judges plead the cause of the
            faith, and they themselves would adjudge the victory to him, and laugh at
            these men. And therefore many were threatening to kill him, in order to rid
            themselves of him; and above all those who did not know him by sight and
            were accustomed to hear about him used to threaten him; and for this reason
            <pb n="145"/><pb n="145"/>he had left his hair and also his beard like that of a layman; because in the
            country of the <persName>Persians</persName> they allow the beards of laymen to grow and increase
            as much as they can; and for this reason no one knew that he was not a
            layman, unless it were someone who was very well acquainted with him.
            And, when he was, as he used to tell us, on the point of entering a certain
            city, he found some clergymen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κληρικοί</foreign>) sitting at the gate; and they asked
            him as a stranger coming from a distance, <quote>Whence do you come?</quote> And
            he said to them, <quote>I am a stranger</quote>. They say to him: <quote>Where have you
               heard that that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> the debater is?</quote> And he turned round and looked
            at them; and, that they might not know that he was the man, he on his part
            said: <quote>Woe for those same men</quote>, and passed on, hearing them say, <quote>This
               man is one of ours, and he has heard him crying out against us, and for this
               reason he cries <quote>Woe for him</quote></quote>; and thus he passed on and went away,
            while they asked him about himself, and they did not recognise him; and so
            the Nestorians dreaded him everywhere. Once again he set out and went
            to visit the believers in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/219">Hirthad Nuʿman</placeName>; and the great <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign> of <persName>Arzun</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n145-1"></ptr>,
            having sent and learned that he had gone to <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/219">Hirtha</placeName>, sent to the believing
            <pb n="146"/><pb n="146"/>bishops, and said to them: <quote>Assemble together, and come let us debate
               about the faith</quote>. And the bishops on hearing it were alarmed; and they
            write to him saying, <quote>Wait for us</quote>; but he knew that they desired to send
            about the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName>, and he continued pressing them more, thinking,
            <quote>Lest they send and inform him and he come, and again we shall not be able
               to speak a word</quote>. But they on their part wrote a letter and horsemen<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n146-1"></ptr>, and
            sent after him. And, when he heard it, he rose promptly and took two Arab
            mares<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n146-2"></ptr>, and quickly arrived among them. And, when they saw him, they
            rejoiced greatly, and gave thanks to God; and they rose and went to the
            man who had written to them, while he had no notion that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> was in the
            land of the <persName>Persians</persName>, but supposed that he was in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2792">Saracen territory</placeName>. The
            blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> says to the believing bishops, who were five: <quote>Lo!, as soon
               as the Nestorians see me, they will be amazed; and, because they will not
               know what to say, they will end by saying this, <quote>We will not permit this
                  man to join in the discussion with us, since he is a disturber</quote>. But do you
               say to them: <quote>If you are not willing that all of us should join in the discuss<pb n="147"/><pb n="147"/>ion, 
                  then neither will we ourselves hold discussion with you</quote></quote>. Then at
            the sight of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> these men were astounded and disturbed; and
            they were also caught and did not know what to do. To decline the debate
            would bring ridicule upon them, since it was they who had originated the
            debate; and again to speak and be defeated would bring disgrace upon them.
            The blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> again says to them: <quote>If you desire to debate with us,
               we need umpires and an audience to hear the discussion between us, lest we
               fall into empty talk. But let us in the presence of an upright audience
               speak a few words that will refute and be refuted</quote>. They say to him: <quote>If
                  you want an audience, we on our side will ask the king's <foreign><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3236">marzban</persName></foreign> who is
                  here</quote>. He on his side says to them: <quote>Neither will we refuse to accept
                     the <foreign><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3236">marzban</persName></foreign>'s decision</quote>. Then all together were going to a <persName>Magian</persName> to
            argue about the faith; even as this too was brought about by divine dispensation, 
            that even through the heathen the true mystery of the right faith
            might be proclaimed. And, when they had taken their seats opposite one
            another and begun to discuss, the great <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign>, whose name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/969">Babai</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n147-1"></ptr>,
            inasmuch as he took precedence over all, first said: <quote>My lord, we inform
               your high excellency that these men are the king's enemies, and their faith
               <pb n="148"/><pb n="148"/>agrees with that of the <persName>Romans</persName>, and they convey the secrets of the kingdom
               to the <placeName>Roman dominions</placeName></quote>. But this wretched <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign>, because he knew
            that if he opened his mouth on the subject of the faith he would be put to
            shame, began to make accusation, not knowing that God would put him to
            shame; and, because he did not know what to do, had recourse to accusation.

            But that governor as if inspired by the grace of God answered him, saying:
            <quote>These are our affairs, not yours. If we learn that as a matter of fact these

            of thanks was offered to the <persName>Magian</persName> by the believers, who said, <quote>Your judgment

            says to him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n148-1"></ptr>: <quote>My lord, as to our faith we have to speak about a certain
               man like us, who was born from a woman as we were, and upon whom the
               Word<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n148-2"></ptr> of God came down on account of his uprightness and his righteousness;
               and, just as the king of kings might find a beggar's son in a dungheap
               <pb n="149"/><pb n="149"/>girt with rags, and give orders about him that they should raise him from
               the dungheap, and strip the rags with which he was girt off him and clothe
               him in royal raiment, and the king might issue an order <quote>Let everyone
                  name this man my son</quote>, and, because that poor man found grace in the
               king's eyes, he also conferred upon him the honour of being called his son,
               so God was pleased to name this man to whom the contention between us
               relates his Son by grace, when he is not so by nature</quote>.
            And he came to an end. The governor says: <quote>What do you say?</quote> <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> says: <quote>We
               know that your wisdom will not go astray. Therefore we entreat you by the
               great God (may he prolong your days) out of all the statements which the
               <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign> has made to investigate two, and examine and judge fairly</quote>. He
            says to him: <quote>Tell me which</quote>. He says to him: <quote>Since the <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign>
               stated in the presence of your highness that an ordinary man like us was
               born of a woman, let your wisdom put this question to him. Whereas we
               are born of a woman from the seed of a man, inquire<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n149-1"></ptr> from him as to the
               man who he told you was born of a woman like us, was he from the seed of
               <pb n="150"/><pb n="150"/>a man like us, or whence was he</quote>. The governor says to the <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign>:
            <quote>What say you about these things? Was the man of whom you spoke to
               me from the seed of a man, or whence was he?</quote> But he was struck with
            shame, and he could not say that he came from seed. He says to him: <quote>He
               did not come from seed</quote>. He says to him, <quote>And whence is his conception?</quote>
            He says to him: <quote>It is written that it is from the Holy Spirit</quote>. He says
            to them: <quote>Lo! therefore you lied when you said that he is an ordinary man
               Lo! therefore his conception and birth are not like us, but above
               us; for we for our part never heard that a man was born without seed. And,
               if in the case of this man whom you accuse you have yourself on the other
               hand testified that he was born without copulation and without seed, he is
               not an ordinary man like us; and by your own testimony you have been
               condemned, and these men speak truth rather than you</quote>. While the party 
            [of] the believers were proceeding to extol the governor with praises, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName>
            says to the <foreign><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3236">marzban</persName></foreign>: <quote>My lord, let them confess one more point in the
               presence of your wisdom, and let us dispense with lengthy speech</quote>. He
            says to him, <quote>What?</quote> <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> says to him: <quote>Since the <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign> said to
               your highness that the king of kings takes a poor man's son from a dung<pb n="151"/><pb n="151"/>heap 
               and clothes him in royal raiment, and orders him to be called his son,
               and therefore by grace everyone calls him the king's son while he is not his
               son by nature, let your highness put the question to him: <quote>Has that poor
                  man's son (though the king takes him and names him his son while he is
                  not so according to his own very statement<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n151-1"></ptr>) a natural father? Or whence
                  was he born?</quote> Inquire<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n151-2"></ptr> from him who is the father of the man also of whom
               he speaks. Has he a natural father? and if not let him show in your
               presence whence he was born and who his father is</quote>. When the <foreign xml:lang="ln">catholicus</foreign>
            received the questions put by the <foreign><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3236">marzban</persName></foreign>, with the whole assembly of his
            bishops, they closed their lips and hung their heads, and could not utter a
            word; and when the judge sharply insisted on their declaring the father of
            him of whom they were speak, they confessed that he was born from God and
            without copulation.
         </p>
         <p>
            The governor says: <quote>Therefore if God was his father his son also is
               God. And, if again a man was his father and he came from the seed of
               copulation like us, he himself also was a man as you said before. But by the
               words that you have spoken you have refuted and condemned yourself; and
               men who are fewer than you hold the true and sound logical position, and
               the thing is as they say by your own testimony</quote> Then the believing
            <pb n="152"/><pb n="152"/>bishops continued giving vent to exclamations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φωνάς</foreign>), saying, <quote>God preserve
               your wisdom and your uprightness many years. God multiply your greatness 
               many times, and grant you a good life</quote>. And so they separated, the
            Nestorians having been put to shame. This was also the occasion of this
            saint's episcopate; because they often pressed him to accept ordination to
            the episcopate, and he would not consent; but, after he had come out victorious, 
            they seized him by force and made him bishop for a place called Beth
            Arsham<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n152-1"></ptr>, and thereforward he bore the title of metropolitan bishop of Beth
            Arsham . And so he would go about in the interior countries beyond the
            <persName>Persians</persName> and make disciples, and convert men from paganism and Magism,
            and return again to the same country, and strenuously meet those who held
            the impious doctrine of Nestorius in the same contests; and these were again
            inflamed with hatred against him. And some moreover of the most eminent
            among them made cruel accusations against him and all the believers as
            well before <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2286">the Persian king</persName>. Then he issued an order that all the believing 
            bishops should be arrested, and all the chief archimandrites, and
            <pb n="153"/><pb n="153"/>committed to prison at Nisibis; and thus they were arrested and imprisoned
            in bitter confinement (as is the custom of the <persName>Persians</persName> who imprison without
            mercy) for seven years, being subjected to great distress and severe trial
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>), so that the mouth is too small for us to describe that distress. And
            then, after their own lives had wasted away, and they were all already
            knocking at the gate of death, from the distress and also from the length of
            time, an account of these things was written to the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3191">king of Aethiopia</persName>; and,
            since he also was a believer, he made this request though his <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3622">ambassadors</persName>
            of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2286">the Persian king</persName>, and he released them from that distress. But after a
            time much accusation was again made against them before the king by the
            Nestorian bishops, who said: <quote>Our people hold the faith among
               all Christians and in all kingdoms</quote>. When the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> learned these things, he
            came to the king's court, and strenuously contended in the refutation of this
            falsehood. But the Magians, being much worried by them, since they did
            not know how to judge and decide between them, issued an order in these
            terms: <quote>Whoever of you wishes it, permission is given to him to go out
               <pb n="154"/><pb n="154"/>and go round among the kings of the Christian peoples, and among the
               chief bishops and authorities, and bring us their faith and their seals, that
               we may know which party among you speaks well and shows great correctness</quote>. 
            But this earnest blessed man, when he heard these words,
            rejoiced with great joy; and from the ardour of his zeal, since he had thus set
            his face to the task, the labour of going<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n154-1"></ptr> from peoples to peoples, and from
            kingdoms to kingdoms was not reckoned by him as anything at all, but he
            undertook this with joy as something light and easy and of no moment<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n154-2"></ptr>.
            And he set out at once without delay in his zeal, in order to traverse the
            frontiers of the peoples and the kingdoms, not being hindered or frightened
            by fear of anything, not of the great length of the intervening space, nor
            the dangerous character of the countries on account of robbers, nor the
            crossings of the rivers, nor the long distances to be covered, and, what is
            greater than all, not even the burden of his old age; but thus, in confidence
            on God and the ardour of his burning zeal, he made light of everything, and
            <pb n="155"/><pb n="155"/>set out and travelled in all countries in which the preaching of <persName>Christ</persName> had
            set foot, eastern and northern and southern, wherever there were peoples
            and kingdoms to whom the preaching of the gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγελιον</foreign>) had penetrated,
            in the east and the north and the south; but toward the west he came only
            as far as the royal city, and he ended his course there, the third time that he
            came up<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n155-1"></ptr>, while we were present there. The good and mereiful God therefore, 
            who does not fail to reward zeal for his name, on seeing the man's
            purpose of mind and his zeal, and that he underwent weariness no less than
            that of the apostles without shrinking, himself also bestowed upon him in
            no less degree than upon them his gift that was given to the apostles, of
            speaking with new tongues. For, whatever people's country he entered,
            on the third day that came he would speak with them in their own tongue,
            thanking God who had visited him. And so also he even delivered an exposition 
            in the chancel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βήμα</foreign>) in the churches of all the peoples to whom he
            went; and on this account he would declare and say to us with tears, <quote>In
               this matter I recognised clearly that God had visited me and strengthened
               me, and that he had not withheld his grace and his merey from me</quote>. But
            <pb n="156"/><pb n="156"/>he reflected, <quote>What parchments (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χάρτης</foreign>) and what rolls are capable of going
               through all this wear of long and protracted journeys through the countries
               without being torn to pieces?</quote> And for this reason, and in order that the
            certainty of the writing might remain without suspicion of alteration, he made
            great linen cloths and medicated them, so that they might take writing,
            which also will, I think, be preserved by the believers in the land of the
            <persName>Persians</persName> for ever; and on them he would accordingly write the belief of every
            people in their own language from their archbishops, and above the belief he
            affixed the seals of the king of that people and of the bishops of the same
            and of their chief men in lead upon these cloths, and thus confirmed it, acting
            thus among all peoples and all tongues among the believers<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n156-1"></ptr>, going about
            and taking their belief and the seals of their soverans and of their highpriests. 
            And thus he collected the belief of many peoples and of many
            tongues on these cloths. And he turned back after seven years and went
            away (?)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n156-2"></ptr>; and, while he was on his way back, the king in whose days he had
            started died<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n156-3"></ptr>, and the magnates who had been umpires, and his son succeeded
            <pb n="157"/><pb n="157"/>him; and he proceeded to stir up war in the territories of the <persName>Romans</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n157-1"></ptr>, and
            his appearance before the authorities was not carried out. But it became
            known to all men living in the country of the <persName>Persians</persName> that the evil doctrine of
            Nestorius flourished there only, while all peoples and tongues abhorred it;
            and this glorious old man was yet more emboldened against them. In this
            same zeal then some occasion called him to go up to the queen of the <persName>Romans</persName>,
            to ask her for a letter to the chief queen of the <persName>Persians</persName> about the affairs of
            the believers, and, if it were possible, to go up in the same zeal to the territories 
            of <placeName>Rome</placeName>. And she gladly consented, because she had in fact been
            well acquainted with his earnestness and his zeal for some time; and she
            detained him there for the space of one year, holding him in great honour.
            And God saw the saint's labour, and that he had grown old and very feeble,
            and his signal gave command and he fell asleep there, in our presence; so
            that his presbyter who himself also was devout and virtuous, whose name
            was <persName>Paul</persName>, lived with us in the domicile of the glorious patrician <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3246">Probus</persName> for
            two years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n157-2"></ptr>, while at all seasons we meditated together upon the eloquence
            <pb n="158"/><pb n="158"/>of the holy old man <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/53">Simeon</persName> and on his treatises and his proceedings against
            the heretics (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αίρεσιώται</foreign>), Nestorians and Manichees, and followers of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3">Bar Daisan</persName>
            and Eutychianists; since he also composed a work of instruction and books
            of objections against the heretics, and he write many letters on the faith to
            many believers everywhere, some of which in the saint's own handwriting
            we inherited in order to supplement his blessing. But at last that presbyter
            also as well fell asleep in the same city, bearing the testimony of a devout
            manner of life.
