            A relation therefore of the history of the admirable modes of life of this
            holy Thomas did not seem to me to be alien to this holy series, even if it
            be not related by us in accordance with its magnificence, on account of the
            greatness of his later modes of life, and the fervour of his zeal in divine
            things, and his mortification and the crucifixion of his body to this world; a
            <pb n="284"/><pb n="284"/>man with whom we were in pleasant and spiritual intercourse for thirty
            years after his training<note></note>.
         </p>
         <p>
            This saint's father therefore, whose name was Šnq, was formerly a great,
            renowned, and distinguished man before the kings”, and he held the office of
            the satrapy in the districts of Syria and Armenia<note></note> for many years, while the
            kings? and all the leading men listened to him and welcomed him, insomuch 
            that the man became exceedingly rich and great, in gold and silver,
            and extensive lands, and many slaves; while everything that he possessed
            was on a great scale, were it fields or woods, or parks (Tapadeloos) or high
            buildings of vast size; insomuch that in riches and dignity he held a very
            high place among those who were in the East. This man therefore had
            this devout son besides another brother; and he also as well as himself was
            distinguished and renowned before the kings?; and he bestowed great care
            upon him that he might receive the best possible education in the wisdom
            of the Greeks, placing him at Berytus and at Antioch and at other places,
            while he also spent large sums of money on him in accordance with the
            <pb n="285"/><pb n="285"/>scale demanded by the high position. He therefore was brilliantly instructed, 
            and sagaciously educated, for many years; because by his own nature
            he possessed in general the quality of sagacity. And, when the time came
            and he had been taught and had received a first-rate education, his father
            began to occupy himself in introducing him into the office itself, since he
            was indeed destined to receive the charge (otpatix) of the great governorship 
            (åezeia)'; and, while he was making these plans, the end overtook 
            him; and <quote>on that day</quote>, as it is written, <quote>all his plans perished</quote>?.
            And this his son remained over his house and over his office, his brother
            also having died; and he too began to deliberate with himself and to say:
            <quote>My father, who acquired all this dignity and greatness and property and
               riches, has left everything, and out of all his house and his riches and his
               property and his office nothing has gone with him except sins only; and I
               therefore now, if I stay and add to my father's property to the same extent
               as he did, and to the same extent a thousand times over, shall presently die
               as he did, and it will become the property of others, and perhaps it will
               become the property of men who´are prodigal and vicious and of fornicators,
               and they will squander it in evil fashion; and to me what will come from it
               <pb n="286"/><pb n="286"/>except hell and eternal torment, since neither has all this been amassed
               by justice or by righteousness, but by plundering and cheating the poor?
               And now why do I need office and governorship that passes away and decays,
               and gains nothing else for those who enjoy it except a bad end and judgment 
               and torment? And therefore I will go up to the rulers, and surrender
               to them the governorship which is theirs, and for me it is sufficient to sit in
               my house in the silence of my soul and praise God; and what we have is
               sufficient for me and my children if they live many times over(?)</quote>. He had
            taken therefore during his life<note></note> a great wife from the great and renowned
            family (révos) of those who are called Arsacids, who, as they say, were themselves 
            also an exalted royal race. Such thoughts then first sprang up in
            this blessed man; and he forth with began to carry the thing out, not delaying,
            but going up at once to the royal city, and making this request of the king,
            that he would order them to receive an account of his office. But the king
            continued to press him to fill his father's place; and he made supplication
            and said: <quote>If your majesty's slave has found mercy in your eyes, order me
               <pb n="287"/><pb n="287"/>only to sit in silence in my house in your dominions; since I am indeed not
               equal to the position of ruler; and why must I overwhelm myself and others
               and incur sin?</quote>. And the king, admiring his words, did not press him, but
            ordered them to receive it<note></note> from him and let him be released. And thus he
            was released, and went down to his house with joy, giving thanks to God
            and saying: <quote>Now that God has delivered me from robbery and cares and
               anxieties, I will attend to myself and my house and my properties (ousias),
               and will administer them in a religious spirit; and further I will remember
               my father who ran his course in the vanity of this deceitful world, and amassed
               all these things for me. And, in order that I and his own spirit itself may
               receive deliverance, since I know that he did great injustice, I on my side
               will give alms out of the very sum that he amassed, that he may find at
               least a little mercy on the judgment-day</quote>. And from that time therefore he
            began to carry out these same things, and he did not give and act in the
            ordinary way like other men, but he would in private grasp the receiver, and
            in private fall on his face before him weeping and beseeching him to entreat
            God to accept his purpose, and absolve his father also, saying, <quote>Since you,
               <pb n="288"/><pb n="288"/>my brothers, have not provoked God by robbery and injustice, entreat him
               on our behalf, of whose wickednesses there is no end, that he may be reconciled 
               to us, and have mercy upon us in the great day; since even this which
               we are giving comes from the blood of the souls of the poor and of the indigent, 
               and of orphans and of widows</quote>. When he had been doing these
            things for a long time, everyone was astonished at him and praised God,
            thinking what a cruel and rapacious father had begotten what a just and
            generous and merciful son. But, while he was making many distributions
            of alms to all the needy and giving them, during these things his thoughts
            also were receiving a praiseworthy advance, so that he began to lay a sound
            foundation for penitence, with affliction and fasting and prayers at all times;
            and henceforth out of all his great dainties and delicacies he fed on nothing
            except bread only and salt; and gradually his thoughts progressed until they
            reached this point, to sell all that he possessed and give to the needy as
            our Lord also commanded, and take his cross and follow him<note></note>. And this he
            did not delay to carry out, but he thereupon sent a message to the magnates of
            the district his neighbours, and stated that, if they were willing to buy his
            lands which bordered upon them and, if not, they were not to be annoyed
            <pb n="289"/><pb n="289"/>at strangers buying them. And, when this news was received, like that
            which our Lord says in the parable, <quote>A man who finds treasure in a field
               hath sold all that he possessed and bought that field</quote>', so everyone
            who had anything was eager to sell all that he had, and buy one of these
            admirable and extensive fields. And so, since everyone hastened to be the
            first to buy, and further since he himself also did not do much valuing, in a
            short time he sold the great estate (oucía), not being deterred by the beauty
            of the buildings, nor the extensiveness of the courts that were scattered
            over these lands, nor the thickness of the many woods and of the parks
            (Tapide:cos) with various kinds of fruit, nor the attractiveness of the irrigation
            and of the gardens and of the vines, and the circuit of long walls which
            formed a strong fence round the meadows and vines and fruit; but, just as
            a man becomes often drunk from wines, so his soul became drunk on God,
            and he scattered all his possessions in the fervour of his love; since the eye
            of his mind was henceforth set on the possessions that remain, and the
            scattering of temporal ones therefore did not trouble him, while henceforth
            he devoted himself to making gifts on a large scale to the needy and the
            distressed, and to those who had creditors, and to churches and monasteries,
            <pb n="290"/><pb n="290"/>and he dissipated his possessions without stint in a manner that cannot be
            understood and told; while he also built a certain monastery (which is a well-fortified 
            stronghold) for his own personal use and that of his whole household, 
            since both great and small and his wife and his children, and his
            slaves also and many free men who were attached to him would promise
            him to yoke themselves with him under the gentle yoke of monasticism,
            which they in fact did.
         </p>
         <p>
            And he prepared two places, one for himself and the men who were
            with him, and another for his wife and the other women who were with her,
            while he collected certain renowned and distinguished blessed men, and
            they came and made vigil and prayer, and gave them the habit (Gyõuce); and
            they used to teach them the methods of the religious life and the ordinances
            of monasticism; and so again his wife also as well sent and fetched for
            herself two great and holy women from the land of the Cappadocians, and
            they lived with her, and taught both her and her one daughter and everyone
            who was with her the discipline of religion. And henceforth all the blessed
            men used severely to bind upon themselves great burdens of asceticism and
            of watching and of abstinence and bear them, in order to subdue the worldly
            <pb n="291"/><pb n="291"/>animal instincts of their bodies, and beget mildness and humility and
            religion instead of the things that are in the world, while the report of their
            labours and of their asceticism was heard everywhere; and thenceforth many
            magnates and sons of distinguished magnates, marveling at what this
            blessed man had done, would imitate him, and like him despise the whole
            world; and some would come to him that they also might receive the habit
            (cxñux), and some again would hasten to other districts and well-known
            convents, which many in fact did. And accordingly this blessed man had
            been made a great and beautiful sight for all men, while he had also determined 
            for himself that he would never throw himself upon his side or rest
            his head upon a pillow, or let water fall upon his body, or oil, as far as was
            possible, except under the pressure of great necessity (šváyxn), which he in
            fact carried out, until his feet were like charred columns, being thick and
            black, until after ten years they used to discharge a large quantity of
            matter, and were as if they were not his, since he was smitten with severe
            ulcers, and would not concern himself even to wash off that discharge, and
            to apply a poultice, while we used often to say to him<note></note>, <quote>While thinking
               <pb n="292"/><pb n="292"/>yourself to be showing prowess, you will be defeated, if you do not attend
               to these ulcers, and you will fall</quote>. But he would look in astonishment at
            us, saying: <quote>Then (špa), when these feet are anointed with drugs, and are
               rubbed by many persons and cleaned with great care, someone would perhaps
               come and say, <quote>They have enough, now let them pay for the outward show
                  with which they have been magnified, lest they be requited for it in hell</quote></quote>.
            And so, being amazed at the soundness of his intellect, we would allow the
            matter to drop. Of the rest of the severe practices and heavy labours which
            they laid not only on themselves, but also the rest of their disciples and his
            wife and children<note></note>, we are not capable of composing a relation or description,
            so far did they transcend the limits of corporal creatures. And this again
            is a point that is very admirable and great, that at the beginning when they
            began, the first day, each one of them found the last day also, that of his
            end (?)?, without wearying of the life or slackening and falling off, through
            sicknesses, or through the infirmity of his body, or through the intensity of
            the winter cold, or through the extremity of the summer heat. But the
            <pb n="293"/><pb n="293"/>blessed man, hecause he used to bestow much labour on reading, conceived
            the desire of obtaining some books of the fathers; and in consequence of
            this desire he directed his journey to Alexandria the great with three of his
            followers; and he entered into communication with the many holy bishops
            and the others who on account of the persecution were at that time collected
            there<note></note>; and he was strengthened yet more both in the faith and in labours.
            And he bought many great books of all the fathers, the full amount that he
            could and was able to obtain, about five large loads?, and similarly also some
            spices for a hundred denarii from Edessa; and he returned having collected
            examples of virtue. And so he thenceforth occupied himself constantly
            night and day, besides constant prayers and frequent repetitions of service,
            in reading books of the fathers containing commentaries and exhortations
            and dogmatics (doyu.stiza), so that thenceforward his mind was enlightened
            like the sun. After twelve years during which the blessed man with all the
            rest of his convent was thus distinguishing himself, the smoke of heretical
            persecution was being exhaled in the same district of Armenia, the instigator
            and perpetrator of these things being the likeness of the original Antichrist,
            the man who held the authority of the patriarchate in Antioch at that time,
            <pb n="294"/><pb n="294"/>whose name was Ephraim the son of Appian<note></note> of Amida; who in his own
            person displayed beforehand in the church of God all the things that are to
            be done in the world at the end by the false Christ. This man's brother
            therefore was in the district of Armenia and Syria, holding the office of the
            satrapy previously held by the blessed Thomas himself?; and this man
            stirred up a cruel persecution against all the believers in the district of Armenia; 
            and thereupon the chorepiscopi and the heads of convents and the rest of
            the priests of the villages assemble before the blessed Thomas as before a
            teacher and a learned man and a leader of men, so that a great assembly of
            five hundred men was formed, saying, <quote>Everything that he commands we
               will do</quote>. Then these things stirred up violent odium against the virtuous
            Thomas himself, since they said, <quote>He is a head and an example to all who
               are in this district to rebel against us</quote>. Then, when the numbers of their
            assembly had further mounted even to eight hundred, they thereafter received
            summonses to the <foreign xml:lang="la">praetorium</foreign> of the satrap, that they might do one of two
            things, either assent to the impiety of the synod of Chalcedon, or leave the
            <pb n="295"/><pb n="295"/>district. But they, when they came and stood before the judge and were
            required to do these things, all as they had been taught by the blessed man
            cried: <quote>We for our part will not deny Christ; and we will not confess or
               introduce a quaternity in place of the holy Trinity. Far be it from us to communicate 
               with the renegades</quote>. Upon these words being uttered in a loud
            voice by all that great company the persecutor and judge and all the hearers
            were alarmed, and trembling fell upon all of them, from the intensity of the
            one stern cry that resounded like a great thunderclap; and, when the persecutor 
            saw that, unless he first bound the strong man, he could not reduce
            his camp<note></note>, he formed the plan of turning the whole force of his efforts in the
            struggle against the blessed man himself in place of all that company, saying
            to him: <quote>All these things are your doing; and, if all these men die, they will
               die at your hands; and henceforth you must contend with the king. Either
               depart from this district at once, or prepare yourself for the struggle</quote>.
            But the blessed man as one possessed of confidence and strength said to him:
            <quote>For my part, O man now exalted, I am not frightened of your words, and
               your threats are of no account to me; nor in the matter of the faith of Christ
               do I take account of the king, nor of you, nor of anyone who lives in this
               <pb n="296"/><pb n="296"/>world. But, lest you think that I for my part am bound by district or place,
               if you seek to expel me from the district, I on my part will leave this evening,
               that you may know that I am not bound by anything else except by Jesus
               my God by whose name I was saved</quote>. He said to him: <quote>If you wish
                  to respect yourself, and not let there be slaughter in the whole district
                  on your account, depart from the district</quote>. But the blessed man gladly
            undertook to depart, saying, <quote>Would that I the sinner might be persecuted
               on behalf of the great name of Christ my God; for I neither have merited nor
               do merit this privilege</quote>. And so he departed from his district with all who
            were with him; and the rest of all that assembly journeyed after him, and
            some to other districts, and some to the stern and rugged mountains; and
            so all of them everywhere bravely endured the violent and cruel persecution.
            But the blessed man crossed into the district called Claudias, and there he
            bought a site; and on that site on the high mountains of towering size above
            the river Euphrates he erected some small huts forming two monasteries
            for women and for men; and there for the future they valiantly carried out
            the labours which they habitually practised. When he had completed the
            period of thirty years in banishment<note></note>, when afterwards we used to resort to
            <pb n="297"/><pb n="297"/>the presence of the same blessed man himself, and wished as it were to offer
            him consolation, he would show his fortitude and his courage yet more by
            saying, <quote>For my part I am ready not only to be expelled or to die one death
               only for Christ's sake, but also, if it were possible for a man to die ten thousand 
               deaths, even this will not distress me</quote>. And so thenceforward the
            severe life of the mountains and the multifarious hardships existing upon
            them were counted by those persons as a spacious garden; for, when he had
            found that quiet retreat, he had great joy and pleasure, and he thereupon
            made himself a small hut of planks, and used to carry out the great labour
            of his secret practices in it, having laid down an absolute rule for himself
            not to taste bread or wine unless constrained by necessity (váyxn); and thus
            he would feed on pulse and some fruit only, sometimes from one week to the
            next and again on the first day of the week, and sometimes every two or
            three days, so that he was granted the gift of secret vision (Ocopía). And so
            also his sons too who were three he used to train in this great method of
            life, in the same way as his blessed wife who was called Maria also yoked
            herself to the same mode of life, and she also laboured in the same way,
            <pb n="298"/><pb n="298"/>while she never came within sight of the blessed man nor yet of his sons,
