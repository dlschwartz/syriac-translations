            Before these things therefore, in the sixteenth year of the reign of Justinian", 
            after the time of the martyrdom of the blessed combatant (άywviotńs)
            for religion John bishop of the city of Thella at the hands of Ephraim of
            Antioch, when a lack of priests had consequently arisen in the countries of
            the east and of the west, and especially of bishops, then the glorious Hereth
            Bar Gabala, the great king of the Saracens, with many others asked the
            Christ-loving queen Theodora to give orders that two or three bishops might
            immediately be instituted by the orthodox (op9odoo) in Syria. And, since
            the believing queen was desirous of furthering everything that would assist
            <pb n="154"/><pb n="500"/>the opponents of the synod of Chalcedon, she gave orders and two blessed
            men, well-tried and divine persons, whose names were James and Theodore, 
            were chosen and instituted, one for Hirtha of the Saracens", that is
            Theodore, and James for the city of Edessa. And, while the blessed
            Theodore exercised authority in the southern and western countries, and the
            whole of the desert and Arabia and Palestine, as far as Jerusalem, the blessed
            James, having armed himself with religion, and clothed himself in the zeal of
            heroism, extended his course over all the countries not only of Syria and the
            whole of Armenia and of Cappadocia, all of which down to the little ones'
            were especially distinguished and strong in orthodoxy (optodoía) no less
            than Syria, and besides these" in the countries also of Cilicia and the
            whole of Isauria and of Pamphylia and Lycaonia and Lycia and Phrygia and
            Caria and Asia, and in the islands of the sea Cyprus and Rhodes, and
            Chios and Mitylene, and as far as the royal city of Constantinople, in which
            also besides all the countries he displayed the course of heroism, and filled
            <pb n="155"/><pb n="501"/>the ranks of the priesthood, and spread orthodoxy (opodožía) abroad, who not
            only marshalled priests and supplied all quarters, but further also in keen
            religious zeal did not shrink even from making provision for ordaining and
            appointing high-priests, that is bishops, also in every place; so that, since
            he was careful to observe the regulations of the canons which command
            that without three bishops no bishop shall be instituted, he contrived to
            bring with him two monks of good repute for excellence of life, one from
            Cilicia and one from Isauria, and proceeded to the royal city; and, having
            received the advice and permission of the blessed Theodosius patriarch of
            Alexandria, who had been detained in the same royal city by way of exile
            (,optz) on behalf of the truth of the faith, the blessed James with the above-mentioned
            monks directed his path to the city of Alexandria, after fully
            carrying out the ministry of the priesthood in all the countries from the royal
            city as far as the sea-coast of Lycaonia; and so he entered Alexandria; and,
            after he had been in communication with the saintly men there, in accordance
            with the mandate received from the blessed Theodosius the patriarch, they
            assembled, and made these two blessed men bishops, one whose name was
            Conon in the city of Tarsus of Cilicia, and the other whose name was Eugene
            <pb n="156"/><pb n="502"/>in the city of Seleucia of Isauria"; and so he took them and came back to
            Syria with admirable zeal. And so in accordance with the provision of
            the canons they made metropolitans, that is archbishops", one whose name
            was Dimet" from the monastery of Aphthonia" in the city of Laodicea, and
            another whose name was John from the monastery of the house of Mar Bzy
            in Seleucia in Syria", and another from those who were instituted at Alexandria 
            who was mentioned above, whose name was Conon, in Tarsus in
            Cilicia, and the other whose name was Eugene in Seleucia in Isauria; and
            the other bishops also in Syria as follows, John from the monastery of the
            house of Mar Bassus in Kenneshrin", and another whose name was Sergius
            from the monastery of Aphthonia in Charrhae, and another whose name was
            John from the monastery of the house of Mar Hanina in Sura Romanorum.
            And, when they had set up bishops for the various cities of Syria as has
            been described, afterwards they went up to the royal city, and in our presence 
            they ordained a patriarch in Antioch, a man whose name was Sergius
            from the city of Thella, who was living in the royal city and was versed
            <pb n="157"/><pb n="503"/>in religious learning. And, when he had completed three years, he departed from the world; and after a time again they ordained a man whose name
            was Paul from Alexandria. About this man many controversies arose",
            and continue to the present time when these things were written. And
            again in the city of Amida they ordained as metropolitan a man whose name
            was Eunomius, who had been expelled with others among the same clergy
            of Amida, in the same royal city. And for the countries of Egypt, by the
            mandate of the blessed Theodosius the patriarch, they ordained twelve
            bishops at once in the royal city itself, for various cities of Thebais and of
            Egypt besides a large number of clergy; inasmuch as the patriarch Theodosius would not consent to ordain priests after he had left his see. And
            afterwards the blessed James and his companions went out to the countries.
            of Asia for the second time, and they ordained four bishops in Asia, one in
            Ephesus a man whose name was John the Syrian, the converter of the pagans",
            and in Smyrna a man whose name was Peter", and another whose name was
            John in the city of Pergamum, and another whose name was Peter in the
            city of Tralles. And after these things they crossed to the island of Chios
            <pb n="158"/><pb n="504"/>and set up a bishop in it, a man whose name was Kashish' from the monastery 
            of John of Ephesus, both of whom were from the monastery of the
            house of Mar John at Amida. And again they went back and crossed to
            the regions of Caria, and there they set up two bishops, one whose name
            was Paul in a city the name of which is Aphrodisias², and another whose
            name was Julian in a city the name of which is Alabanda". These are all
            the bishops and archbishops, who are in number twenty-seven, besides two
            patriarchs whom the blessed James ordained with all the other bishops,
            besides many clergy in all the eastern and western countries. Many of all
            these were instituted in our presence, and with regard to the truth of all
            these things we give confident and truthful witness that they were done as
            above, and we have made a commemorative record of them for the knowledge
            of posterity; but of the sublime manner of life of the blessed James, and his
            courage and perfection, we have made a record in the preceding history.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of two bishops the excellent and divine blessed men, James and
            Theodore, is ended.
