            This holy Zacharias was in one of the great convents; to which same
            convent I used often to repair on account of the pre-eminently great modes
            of life of certain saints in it, and I had much intercourse with this old man,
            while he on his part made this his concern to shun intercourse with men,
            being a man who had one intercourse only. This man therefore, when I used
            to entreat him, <quote>Our father, let me not be deprived of the profit and gain
               that is acquired through you, because it is written <quote>He who soweth receiveth
                  wages, even if the earth disappoint</quote>'; but, as for the saint, when he heard
               these things, his tears would gush forth with sobs, so that for a whole hour
               would be putting constraint upon himself to be silent, and was scarcely
               able to do so; and again he would cease and bow his head in silence.</quote><!-- This is not in translation but is required to make sense of the quotations. --> And
            again I on my side would entreat him to give me the favour of his conversation
            (for it was not his habit to converse on the spur of the moment with anyone).<pb n="267"/>
            But on my pressing the blessed man, he said to me with sighs: <quote>Why, my son,
               do you require me to speak? Lo you see that Christianity has vanished from
               the earth, and religion has been forgotten, and vanity and error have prevailed.
               And now what have we to speak, except to weep for the decadence of our
               generation (yévos), since even we, who are in name Christians, enjoy the
               shelter only of this name, while all the ordinances of Christianity are far from
               us? And now suffer me to weep for my life, and pray for me</quote>. And again
            I said: <quote>How can we live', our father?</quote>. But he said: <quote>If you seek to live,
               lo! he into whose hands you will fall teaches you. If you do not listen to
               him, why do you weary the piece of dust your fellow-slave by superfluous
               talking?</quote> But, after I had pressed him with many questions which I was
            asking him, he turned round and put his hand to his mouth, and stealthily
            took a stone out of his mouth and dropped it into his bosom; and he began
            thenceforth to speak easily with me without any impediment in his tongue;
            while previously his words had been uttered with difficulty, and I on my
            part had been putting this to the account of old age or ascribing it to a<pb n="268"/>
            stammer, by one of which causes the old man's tongue was restrained.
            But, when he suddenly conversed easily with me with many plain words,
            I marvelled in myself and was thinking, <quote>What has happened to the old man?
               for lo! during the space of three years' that I have been in intercourse with
               him he was a stammerer and slow of speech, and in this hour the fastening
               of his tongue has been loosened and he has spoken easily. And, though he
               spoke many words with me in the way of admonition and caution, and
               further on the subject of the end and the future judgment, which was the
               matter on which my mind was above all things intent, I fell on my face
               entreating the old man not to hide from me the reason of his previous and his
               present demeanour; while I had moreover often seen an emblem of a thick
               thread (võu.c) with three knots tied on it and tied to the palm of his left hand,
               which had sunk into his hand and was level with the flesh, and, whenever
               I asked him, he used to tell me that it was a case of disease; and about that
               also I continued inquiring of him with much entreaty and violent adjurations.</quote><!-- This is not in the translation but is required to make sense of the quotation marks. -->
            But the saint took hold of me and raised me up, while he also repeated to me<pb n="269"/>
            this saying from the gospel (sixyyên.cov): <quote>The kingdom of God hath been
               suffering violence from the days of John the Baptist and down to the present
               time, and violent men seize it</quote>'. But, when I again continued to entreat
            him, he said to me: <quote>Since I have seen that you are eager to learn about the
               character of virtue and the life of the soul, I will not deprive you of what you
               wish; and this very consideration it is which from the beginning constrained
               me to devote so much time to conversing with you, in order that I might not
               be condemned on the charge of churlishness; and, if, our brother, you count
               all the days of this year, my conversation that I have held with men during
               the whole year has not reached the total of to-day's conversation; since I
               myself am a sinner, who am not worthy that my mouth should be opened and
               speak</quote>. Then he put his hand into his bosom, and brought out a round
            river-pebble, white and shining, and showed it me, saying, <quote>Since I have
               seen, my son, that you are eager to benefit yourself, lo! this is what
               prevented me from speaking</quote>. But I said: <quote>And tell me, our father, what
                  benefit is derived from this stone. If we wish to be silent, are we not silent<pb n="270"/>
                  without a stone?</quote> He said to me: <quote>One who is alone and whom Satan
                     leaves to himself can do so; but in the case of one who is among many
                     occasions must necessarily call and speech come, however much guard a man
                     keep over himself, because our will is bound to the yoke of forgetfulness.
                     And for this reason I have closed my mouth with this stone, lest my tongue
                     with or against my will cause me to slip; while God knows that to-day this
                     stone has been five years in my mouth without any person being aware of
                     it except a few who are in this convent who have adopted this plan. And, for
                     you, who have learnt it, I shall stand with you before God, if men learn this
                     during the days of my life. And, that you may not think that I alone have
                     adopted this practice, there are now fifteen persons (Topáow tov) in this monastery
                     who have stones placed in their mouths, that they may be trained to silence,
                     and not slip in speech</quote>. While marvelling at this, I made request to him
            about the emblem on his hand also. He said to me: <quote>Now that I have laid
               an injunction upon you, my son, listen. This emblem I had formerly tied to
               my neck; but, because it was visible to many, I undid it, and tied it to my<pb n="271"/>
               hand instead of my neck. Like the frontier which Jacob and Laban set up
               and said, <quote>Thou shalt not pass this heap against me, and I again will not pass
                  it against thee</quote>', so I set this emblem on my neck, between falsehood and
               wrath, the ministers of which are ministers of Satan, and not of God; and I
               made a decree for my soul that, whenever it saw this frontier, it should not
               allow wrath to enter from without, and, if it should be stirred up from within,
               that it should again not pass this frontier to go outside, and falsehood again
               should never go out from within. But these knots of the emblem I have put
               there for private observation; and, of these three knots, one, the first, I have
               put there as a guardian of my thoughts, lest they dissipate themselves in
               vain things, and that, if error gain dominion over my mind, and it be
               suddenly captured and dissipated by the sight of an object, I may remember
               my soul and turn to God; and the second again is guardian of the remembrance
               of God, that, as it does not depart thence, neither may my intellect also
               depart from the remembrance of its Creator; and, if again the evil of error
               gain dominion over and take possession of my intellect, when I see this<pb n="272"/>
               object, I may suddenly turn myself and cry to God to deliver me from error;
               and the third is a symbol of remembrance to keep the commandments of
               him who said, <quote>If ye love me, keep my commandments</quote>'. I know, my son,
               that these things are to many folly, and lead them to deplorable laughter;
               but to me they are very useful, and they are to me the irons of my service,
               but they are not manifest to anyone. Mark that I have testified against you
               before God</quote>. But I, being astounded at the old man's thoughts, and the
            secret ordinances of virtue that he had stamped upon his soul, refrained also
            from repeating these things until his departure, for eight years, while many
            miracles were also wrought through his prayer and through the repository
            of his bones.

            The history of a certain old man whose name was Zacharias is ended.
