            It is therefore no small thing that the memory of the history of Paul also
            the divine man and strenuous worker, who worked in his Lord's vineyard
            <pb n="672"/><pb n="470"/>from morning till evening without growing weary, should be omitted from
            the order of those who have been inserted in this spiritual company. This
            great and earnest Paul therefore was by his birth (yévoç) from Antioch; and
            he was earnest and fervent in religious zeal from his boyhood, so that from
            the greatness of his zeal he became stern and harsh, and a rebuker of those
            who approached religious work sluggishly in any manner; and the object of
            his zeal was to carry poor and old and sick persons by night, and he would
            take them and bathe and anoint them, and mend and change the clothes
            of those who were in need, and take them and give them to drink each one
            according to what was suited for him, and he would give small coins as was
            suited for each one of them. And thus before daybreak in company with
            others who shared his enthusiasm with him he would carry him<note></note>, and would
            go and lay him in his place (and he used to do this not to men only but also
            to women) for a long time; so that in consequence of this he by his zeal
            instigated many persons to share his labour, after teaching everyone from
            his house and from the produce of his labour to carry in his hand every day and
            bring for the use of the poor and sick needy persons according to his power, so
            that accordingly many of them became enthusiastic and used secretly to hasten
            <pb n="673"/><pb n="471"/>to this labour. For many even of the great and eminent men of the city,
            having put off their apparel (xua) and clothed themselves in poor men's
            apparel (½µ¤) and hoods that concealed their heads and faces, would thus put
            straps on their necks and carry the chairs of the sick and poor, and old men and
            women, and perform all the ministration to them, while in their earnest zeal
            they gladly spent money for each man according to his state in life to make
            provision for them. But Paul the earnest in spiritual things, having instituted 
            and organized this ministration to the poor in his city of Antioch, and
            seen that it was being carried out by many persons with earnest zeal, withdrew 
            and departed to the other great cities, stirring zeal and enthusiasm in
            many, and organizing and instituting this ministration in all cities through
            certain earnest and Christian men who concerned themselves about their
            lives' salvation, and earnestly endeavoured to gain the inheritance of eternal
            life. When this strenuous worker had been teaching and rousing enthusiasm, 
            and instituting the work of this ministration to the poor in any one
            city, and had passed one year or two or more, and saw that his work had been
            instituted and organized in that city, his zealous plan would next draw him
            <pb n="674"/><pb n="472"/>to another city; and so accordingly he acted in this way and instituted the
            work of this ministration not in eastern cities only<note></note>, but also in many western
            cities too. When accordingly [....]<note></note> that he was not able and sufficient 
            himself in person to repair to every city, he used accordingly to send
            others, and rouse the citizens, and advise and instigate them to take up this
            work, so that this great and holy work, which is more pleasing to God than
            all labours, grew and increased, and was instituted in every place and city,
            through the zealous enthusiasm of the man of God. When he had organized
            and built up and instituted this ministration in many cities, he in his zeal
            repaired to the royal city also besides, insomuch that in a short time he
            succeeded in beginning and gaining distinction and extending it there, and
            instigating many of the great and eminent men to become fellow-labourers
            and partners in his ministration, so that consequently his ministration was
            manifestly extended and increased and magnified, there being no rest or
            intermission all the night and in the day, so that he relieved and fed and
            refreshed not only the poor and maimed and sick and lame and blind and old
            <pb n="675"/><pb n="473"/>in the royal city, but also in all the suburbs beyond the water in all quarters
            of the same city besides, and also in all the cities round, Chalcedon and 
            Nicomedia, and Cyzicus and Prusias<note></note> and Heraclea, and as far as the sea of Pontus,
            while he also bought clothing and brought it out and distributed it and gave
            it to many from any source from which it fell into his hands, while he also
            provided relief and refreshment with every kind of bathing for the poor and
            the strangers who were present. And so this man went on gaining distinction 
            and showing prowess in the Lord's work in the royal city for many years,
            while not neglecting to send money to other cities round Sycae also for the
            expenses of that ministration, which he had planted and instituted in them.
            And accordingly many emulated his zeal and his earnestness and imitated
            it, so that other deaconries (Sixxovías)<note></note> were established not for men only but
            also for women and great and lowly in ardent zeal hastened to minister, and
            to take part by means of gifts. And so the blessed Paul ended the course of
            his practices in the same royal city, bearing good testimony [....]<note></note> only
            <pb n="676"/><pb n="474"/>of dry bones and skin laid over them outside like wood; and thus his whole
            body was dried up from the labour and abstinence and watching, his prayer
            also accompanying his action in all cities in the east and in the west, and
            especially in the royal city, while many consequently clothed themselves
            in his zeal and added something to this ministration, until it grew and 
            increased and expanded everywhere, and every day an addition was made to
            God's glory and the relief of the poor.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of the blessed Paul, who was from the city of Antioch, is ended.
