         <head>Next the Third History, of the Blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1320">John</persName> the Perfect Nazrite.</head>
         <p>
            When we set ourselves to approach and record the history of this holy
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1320">John</persName>, we exposed ourselves to a multitude of conflicting thoughts, in
            consequence of the fact that, if we take upon ourselves to narrate severally
            the signs that were wrought through each of these same saints, we shall
            wander and extend into a great number of unending writings; and for this
            reason we considered that the triumphs only that belong to the labours
            of each of them are enough to excite the praise of God that is in those
            who hear them, and how they bore themselves manfully in the course of
            justice all the days of their life without shrinking, while by reason of this
            fact and the fact further that even one only of the triumphs of each of the
            saints that has been related is sufficient to indicate the divine power hidden
            in him who wrought it, just as it is in the power of expert tasters to know
            <pb n="37"/><pb n="37"/>the whole taste of a tree from one fruit only, on this account we abstain from
            recording many signs in order, only presenting the triumphs gained by their
            labours and the manner of the signs to the memory of expert hearers. This
            perfect blessed man therefore, who is in truth one worthy to be third in this
            series of saints, received his training from his boyhood in the great and
            renowned monastery called that of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/358">Zuknin</placeName><note></note>, while from the very beginning
            of his training he would consider in himself and say, <quote>What profit have I
               from the fact that I feed this body the end of which was doomed to be
               loathsome and disgusting decay? and wherefore do I by a quantity of food
               amass and lay up store in it for a multitude of creeping things and of
               worms?</quote>; since he heard further what the blessed apostle writes saying,
            <quote>Food belongeth to the belly and the belly to food; but God shall make an
               end of both</quote><note></note>, and further that also which is written reproachfully to those
            who concern themselves with the sustenance of their bodies, <quote>Ye took your
               pleasure upon the earth and were wanton, and ye fed your bodies as for a
               day of slaughter</quote>.
         </p>
         <pb n="38"/><pb n="38"/>
         <p>
            When then the blessed man through hearing these things turned his
            thoughts upon himself, he in zeal decided for himself that he would be a man
            aloof from and a stranger to all pleasure that comes through the bodily tastes
            which spring up in food, saying, <quote>I for my part did not depart from the
               things of the world in order to turn back to them; but it is enough that
               I have set myself to be a stranger to these transitory things, in order to
               run after the things that pass not away; and through holding aloof from
               corruptible things I remembered and desired the heavenly blessings which
               the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> indicated and said, <quote>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
                  nor hath it risen into the heart of man, what God prepared for them that
                  love him</quote>. These I must run after and pursue with all my strength,
               casting all corruptible things behind me, except the ordinary nourishment
               of my body in order to sustain it</quote>. And thenceforth the blessed man in
            fervent zeal decided for himself that he would eat no food at all of any
            kind except ordinary bread, and water and salt or ordinary lentils, while
            in place of herbs he used to mix with these the leaves of a certain large
            <pb n="39"/><pb n="39"/>tree that was inside the court of that monastery called shigra<note></note>, eating from
            it all the summer, and in the winter again drying the produce of it and
            eating what was left, while all the members of his convent would urge
            him to desist from this distressing practice that was distressing his body,
            and in this only he did not obey; but the obedience and silence and
            humility in all his other relations of life went even beyond the limits, qualities
            that befit the humble and obedient; so that, if anyone stretched out his
            finger and stuck it in his eye, he would not raise his face (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) and
            look at him, or open his mouth and speak with him, and, if he said to
            him, <quote>Take an ax and come turn this rock over</quote>, or <quote>Come dig out this
               boulder that is not dug out</quote>, he would again not delay for the purpose
            of at least inquiring <quote>How am I to turn the mountain' over</quote> or 
            <quote>dig out the rock?</quote>, but silently take the iron and begin; so that they often
            <pb n="40"/><pb n="40"/>made a kind of trial of him, and he would at once without delay begin
            what was ordered him, until that man whoever he were said to him <quote>Stop</quote>,
            and then he would cease.
         </p>
         <p>
            Again a place had been made by him in the monastery-enclosure, and he
            would spend the rest of the day or of the night there, in vigil without
            measure and prayers without ceasing, so that in consequence of these things
            there was generated for him first sorrow of heart, and floods of tears of
            great weeping by night and by day, insomuch that his eyelids shed their
            lashes from weeping, and the hair of his head fell off in front, from the
            number of times that he used to knock it<note></note> before God in supplication, while
            all who saw him were amazed and wondered at him, and on this account they
            used to call him, <quote><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1320">John</persName> the perfect Nazirite</quote>, while he was thereby openly
            preparing for the contest with the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3680">demons</persName> even to blood, insomuch that 
            sometimes his mind received blows in the contest and was silenced, so that, if there
            was anyone who was present and saw him, he thought that he had a <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3680">demon</persName>,
            in that he had become silent and had secretly in his spirit entered upon a
            secret contest with powers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρχας</foreign>.) and authorities, and during the intervals
            <pb n="41"/><pb n="41"/>of the contest he was so hard smitten that others would approach him and
            speak with him and think that he was dead. And so for ten years this saint
            contended; and at last, when God saw his confidence in him and his
            steadfastness, he gave him strength and victory over his enemies, and from
            that time his mind was enlightened and his spiritual sight cleared, and he
            attained to high and marvellous conceptions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρίας</foreign>) at which men marvelled,
            though he had not laboured at reading the Scriptures, but instead of
            everything he would utter a series of constant prayers; and through this
            there was given to him great perspicacity in the Scriptures and the commentaries, 
            so that men were unable even to comprehend and take in the height
            of his words and the depth of his intellect, even <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3678">the scholastics and the other
               men who were learned in the Holy Scriptures</persName> running to him to hear his
            words, while they were amazed and praised and glorified God. And
            afterwards he attained to authority over unclean spirits, and over great works
            of healing; but, if we record these severally, as we have also stated above,
            many sheets of parchment (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χάρτης</foreign>) will not suflice us. When the blessed
            <pb n="42"/><pb n="42"/><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1320">John</persName> had completed twenty-five years in this life of perfection, heretical
            machinations assailed his convent<note></note>, and all the leading men in it submitted
            under compulsion and great constraint (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκη</foreign>); and accordingly the blessed
            man prepared to withdraw from among them, saying, <quote>For my part I have not
               forgotten the words of our Saviour who says, Whoso shall deny me before
               men, I also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven'?</quote>. Then he
            left them, and departed, while about <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3679">thirty men among the chiefs of the brotherhood 
               and the leading men of the convent</persName> also went out after the blessed
            man, saving to him, <quote>Death with you, our father, is more desired by us than
               life with others</quote>. And so they set forth and went to another district, hoping
            in God, not even bread for the day being found upon them, while the blessed
            man encouraged them and said, <quote>Would, my brethren, that we could attain
               to the blessing of those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake</quote>.
            And so they found a certain monastery and took up their abode in it, while
            the fame of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1320">John</persName> was heard also over the whole district, and
            <pb n="43"/><pb n="43"/>accordingly all who were sick with various diseases and who had evil spirits
            ran to him, and the divine power that was in him would confidently heal
            them all, while everyone was amazed and thanked God; so that we also went
            to him in the district of the saint's martyrdom, i. e. in his exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>), and,
            when we had sat down to take food, five <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3680">demoniacs</persName> together with their hands
            tied behind them and howling beat down the door and came and entered
            foaming; but the blessed man rebuked them, and ordered them to go to the
            martyrs' chapel and lie down; and so they went; and, after we had had
            supper and everyone had gone away to rest, he himself went out and went
            and made a prayer, and expelled them<note></note> all; and they were found in the morning 
            at peace and in their right minds. And we saw it, and were seized with
            amazement at the power of the saint's prayer. We were further specially
            amazed at him, because after severe labour he was even so not remiss; for
            there was an enclosure in that monastery, and one fig-tree inside it, and he
            Went and brought sand and laid it on the south side of that tree, and he filled
            <pb n="44"/><pb n="44"/>a large jar with cold water and hung it on it; and he continued kneeling
            over against it on that sand all through the extreme noonday heat, while
            we were parched even by the shade in consequence of the heat. Again,
            when they had passed a short time, they were again driven from that place
            also, and that which had been sent to them by the grace of God was
            taken by the heretics, while this also gave much pleasure to the blessed
            man, who said, <quote>They have relieved us of a bodily burden that we may run
               after spiritual things</quote>. But, after twelve years had been completed by the
            holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1320">John</persName> in the conflict (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) of the martyrdom of persecution, he ended his
            course in the same exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>), and went to the mansions of rest<note></note>. Before
            the time of the saint's end, when we were with him, when I had heard the
            words of grace that used to come out of his mouth, we entreated him to
            tell us what line of virtue seemed to him to be greater and more excellent than
            the other lines in God's sight. The blessed man said : I. <quote>Among all the
               courses of justice nothing is greater in God's sight than submission that is
               perfect in performing its obligations, in which are comprised all the types of
               <pb n="45"/><pb n="45"/>virtue that bring near to God</quote>. II. Again a second question was presented
            to the same blessed man by us. <quote>If, as you have said, our father, submission 
               is thus greater than everything, how is it that we see triumphs won
               by solitaries and hermits who had not submission, and by the other blessed
               men moreover who also wrought miracles and great acts of power, and lo!
               these did not live in submission, and their virtue was manifest to everyone?</quote>
            The saint's explanation. <quote>Consider, our brother, the divine words, and
               they will themselves show an example of the power that is hidden in
               them. We hear the holy apostle saying, <quote>Every man's work shall be made
                  manifest; for that day shall make it manifest</quote>. And we have learned again
               from him in that he says, <quote>There is great fear of falling into God's hands</quote>?.
               And again we hear the prophet proclaiming of God's judgments, <quote>They are
                  like a great deep that is not fathomed at all</quote>?. Whence is it now tell me
               that on the dreadful day of judgment to many among those who as you said
               were distinguished by acts of power and by signs and by miracles the words
               of our Lord will be spoken in answer, which in his parables he said to those
               <pb n="46"/><pb n="46"/>who said to him, <quote>My Lord, have we not in thy name prophesied, and in thy
                  name done acts of power</quote><note></note>, and he on his side will say to them, <quote>Verily I say
                     unto you I know you not</quote>. And again in the case of those who finished
               their courses in submission for God's sake, setting their will aside and doing
               that of their masters and of their brethren, and despising men and shunning
               even the appearance of virtue, whence is it tell me if that blessing is theirs
               which was given by the Lord of blessings to the lowly, and to the poor in
               spirit, as he also states in the prophet, <quote>Better is one who doeth the will
                  than a thousand</quote>? Whence can we understand the secrets of God's dreadful
               final judgment, and his provision made in righteousness? And my opinion
               is this, that those who have spent the days of their life in due submission,
               according to the gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγέλιον</foreign>) saying, come not to judgment, but have
               passed from death to life.</quote>
         </p>
         <p>
            Again the third question. <quote>And what is the submission which is so great
               in your eyes, O our father?, and how should the man conduct himself who
               <pb n="47"/><pb n="47"/>has set himself to practise submission, and how should he attain to this virtue
               which have mentioned, which you have magnified beyond all classes of
               virtue, and what models are suited for the man who is submissive to
               observe?</quote> The answer of the same blessed man. <quote>There are many models;
                  and there is a submission which while appearing submission begets loss for
                  many by being accompanied by pride and by contumacy, and by the personal
                  wishes of the man who seems submissive and by all the other things; and
                  this leads to hell and not to life. But the submission which properly belongs
                  to religion is this (which should also vary according to difference of inclination), 
                  that he who is ready to snatch spiritual fruits should be ready
                  to listen to every order that is given him simply, and to carry it out
                  diligently, not judging the man who gave him the order, and thinking
                  <quote>This man has ordered me wrongly</quote>, unless he orders some act of sin
                  that is at variance with religion, carrying in himself the model of the
                  patriarch <persName>Abraham</persName>, who made no question or objection against him who
                  ordered him <quote>Take thy son thine only son him whom thou lovest, Isaac, and
                     <pb n="48"/><pb n="48"/>go offer him up to me as a whole burnt-offering upon one of the mountains</quote><note></note>.
                  And, when this man received the order concerning his only son, he did not
                  judge the saying that preceded it which he said to him <quote>In Isaac shall thy
                     seed be called</quote>, and <quote>His seed shall be as the sand of the seas and as the
                        stars in heaven</quote>?; and, when he said to him to whom this son was promised
                  for these purposes <quote>Go kill him</quote>, he accepted it simply, and only determined
                  to show perfect obedience, and to carry to slaughter him in whom he promised him 
                  that his seed should be called; and, what is greater than all,
                  with his own hands to sacrifice his only son, without thinking and saying,
                  <quote>Yesterday he said to me, <quote>In this son shall thy seed be called</quote>, and
                     now he said, <quote>Go sacrifice him</quote>, and how will seed be called in him after
                     he has been sacrificed?</quote> And yet more facts than these were to be found
                  in the affair of the blessed <persName>Abraham</persName>, if he had sought to raise objection
                  against him who ordered him to carry out these two orders which thus
                  seemed outwardly to be opposite to and inconsistent with one another; but he
                  even undoubtingly believed and trusted him who promised, and to him who
                  <pb n="49"/><pb n="49"/>instigated him to kill the son of promise he assented, and he made ready to
                  do it without inquiry; so that in virtue of this will that was submissive to
                  faith and of obedience he attained the position of chief in the kingdom
                  of heaven. So therefore he who is made submissive for God's sake
                  should himself be ready to perform what has been ordered him without
                  judging the man who gave the orders; and the man who gave the
                  orders, whether he gave them wrongly or rightly, shall himself give account 
                  for the orders given by him; for the man himself also from whom
                  he receives them has one who will reprimand him if he give a wrong
                  order. Besides these things it is the duty of the man who professes
                  religion by means of submission to have in him discretion in all matters that
                  conduce to spiritual benefits, that whoever he is he may carry them out
                  discreetly; i. e. to wait upon the saints, to wash the feet of strangers,
                  to relieve them in all that they need, to clean their clothes, to mend
                  all that are torn, to visit the sick, to concern himself about the relief
                  of his brethren in all ways, to keep watch and vigil and pray and sigh
                  before God at all seasons, and <quote>keep his tongue from evil, and his lips
                     <pb n="50"/><pb n="50"/>that they speak no guile, and eschew evil and do good, and seek peace and
                     run after it</quote><note></note>, and this is complete submission, and <quote>blessed is that bondman</quote>,
                        (i. e. disciple) <quote>whom his Lord shall come and find so doing</quote>?. He who
                        serves God by these lines of conduct has nothing equal to his virtue in all the
                        classes of justice; and his standard surpasses ascetics and hermits and
                        solitaries, and all who travel on the narrow road that leads to life", even if
                        it is hidden from him and unknown, or* manifest to him; and to him I for my
                        part assign great blessing, since in all the courses of perfection nothing seemed
                        to me to equal his standard</quote>. Having been amazed at the opinion of this
                  saint, how great in his eyes was the quality of submission, I entreated him to
                  discuss also before me the subject of the abominable passion of fornication,
                  for the sake of my profit and that of the other hearers.

            He when he heard these things sighed and wept; and he began to speak
            thus: <!-- The translation has an opening double bracket here that I don't understand. --><quote>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of
               death?</quote>s Who is he, pray, who will understand the wiles of this fiend, the
            <pb n="51"/><pb n="51"/>stainer and darkener of the soul, and will cry in affliction to God to come
            to his aid, and rescue him from his fraud and from his filthiness? In the
            case therefore of this passion, our brother, he who wishes to escape from
            it and keep true purity, and be purified from all pollution of the flesh and of
            the spirit, needs tears and prayers and many sobs, and parcity of food, and
            abstinence from dishes of varying tastes, because the desire of dishes that
            please the taste are<note></note> a deep cavern in which is no standing-ground. But
            think not that precaution against fornication is this only, precaution against
            that which consists in the open contact of body with body, but that also
            which is many times greater than this, the secret fornication of the heart
            and of the thoughts, is that against which we ought to take special precautions 
            and be diligently on our guard; because many are the wiles by which
            the rebellious fiends endeavour in secret fashion rather than in that which is
            open to cheat and submerge and defile the soul that promises purity to its
            Lord, and strive by their deceits rather than that which is open<note></note> to stain
            and submerge with many kinds of filthinesses, from the mention of which
            <pb n="52"/><pb n="52"/>I am precluded by great shame. But by reason of the workings of these
            filthinesses I am filled with many sighs, because there are many who, while
            taking precaution against open fornication, are in other matters secretly by
            means of fleshly desire grievously defiling the soul as well as the body
            through the enticements of shame, men who need great weeping and sighs
            of aflliction; and how shall they apply a plaster to this wound that thus they
            may escape from the dreadful judgment of torture that is decreed against
            those who take part in these things? He who takes equal precaution in his
            secret and in his open acts also does not yield to the blandishments of
            foulness and of shameful action, either secretly or openly, but more than his
            open guard takes precaution against that which is done in secret, because
            the wound secretly inflicted that is wrought upon the spirit penetrates
            farther than that which is administered openly. But, if he be overcome
            and somehow lapse, secretly or openly, even so he should not despair of
            himself, and deliver himself to the service of foulness, but turn straightway,
            bearing the affliction of his disease, to the gracious <persName>Physician</persName>, who will
            <pb n="53"/><pb n="53"/>easily apply the plaster of his mercy to his infirmity. And further, even if
            the man who has been smitten receive healing, and after it be again
            smitten with another stroke, he should not even so neglect to run a second
            time to the <persName>Physician</persName>'s door, even if he be smitten many times, or refrain
            from entreating for a plaster for his stroke, a thing which we see happen
            in visible battles also to those who are smitten, that, as long as their life is
            preserved in them, even if they be struck many times, they do not neglect
            to take measures for their bodily healing with all carefulness. So those also
            who have lapsed after the lapse of a spiritual fall must act, not falling into
            despair of life, and delivering themselves into the hand of their enemies.
            When these things are brought about in the case of any persons, that, after
            they have been involved in any lapses, they thrust themselves into the deep
            cavern of sin, they are worthy objects for great weeping and many sighs,
            in that, having fallen through a lapse, and having been a little besmirched
            with mire, instead of running to have their stains washed away, through
            he shameful teaching of those who caused them to lapse they resolved to
            <pb n="54"/><pb n="54"/>throw themselves completely into the pit of filthiness, and voluntarily
            remain in the very submersion of their putrescence, which leads them to the
            submersion of condemnation in which there is no absolution, and to the
            wound for which there is no remedy, and bitter lamentation for which there
            is no consolation, and the dreadful judgment of torment which has no end
            for ever and ever. In the case of those who after the lapse of a fall are
            smitten with the same pleasure of sin, and remain in the same den of corruption
            and perdition, without having concerned themselves for the resurrection of
            their souls and the saving of their lives from the putrescence of sin, and
            have delivered themselves to the service of Satan, to whose will they have
            been made captive<note></note> by their free choice, the requiter of their service with
            him will repay them with eternal torment that passes not away, and in
            return for their affection with him and their remaining in his company will
            make them to inherit part of his possessions, which are outer darkness,
            wherein is weeping and gnashing of teeth, according to the saying of the
            Life-Giver?; since they have themselves seceded from him who have joined
            themselves to the destroyer of their lives, with whom if they remain, they
            <pb n="55"/><pb n="55"/>will also be tormented with him; from whom and from all whose doings
            may we all be preserved, by the abundant mercy of the Lord of all.

            These, our brother, are the words which at the instigation of your request
            have been spoken on this subject; but they will be blamed by your sound
            and great and spiritual knowledge on account of the fact that they were
            spoken of fall and resurrection alike, and not according to the character of
            perfection, as your questions also strongly demanded; because we see that
            the disposition of all of us is inclined to and our will bent on a fall rather
            than on hastening to perfection; and therefore we must inquire and ask and
            speak about the forms of our illness and the remedies for it, lest the whole
            body be struck with the ulcers of sin, and grow putrid with the tumour of
            negligence, and we be thereby thrust into the abyss of torment; for we
            learn from the divine <persName>Paul</persName> who said: <quote>There is great fear of falling into the
               hands of the living God</quote><note></note>. What has been spoken is sufficient to stir up
            the memory of the discreet.<!-- The translation has a close double bracket here that corresponds to the one above. I don't really understand either. -->
