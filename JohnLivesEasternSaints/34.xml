            he used to expend upon them, until for many days nothing succeeded in
            <pb n="602"/><pb n="400"/>reaching his own particular table and those with him, while everyone was
            overpowered with great astonishment at the abounding willingness of this
            man of God, how he was not wearied or annoyed and vexed by all that great
            number of poor who were constantly with him, though often both we and
            other lazy persons like me felt weariness, and we were annoyed by the
            clamour and turmoil of many persons when we were present with him, and
            we said, <quote>How is it, our father, that you endure all this turmoil from morning
               even to evening, and do not tell them fixed times at which they may come?</quote>
            But he on his side would say: <quote>Do you tell me, my brethren, have we a
               time at which we knock at God's door and are not received? has he someone
               at his door who is vexed with us or makes announcement to us and says, <quote>Go
                  now and come at another time</quote>? Lo! is not his door open before us at every
               [time] if we on our side wish to knock at it? and how then do you advise me
               that, when he himself comes to my door, I should turn him away, or, when
               he knocks, I should not answer him, or that I should fix a time for him? Is
               it not enough that <persName>Christ</persName> comes on his feet to my door, but that<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n400-1"/> I, a vile
               piece of dust of his formation, should open my mouth to him in insult? or do
               we not believe what he told us in his preaching, saying, <quote>To me ye did it</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n400-2"/>;
               <pb n="603"/><pb n="401"/>whether it be what is good or what is evil? And he said not <quote>To vile and feeble
                  men</quote>, but <quote>To me ye did it</quote>.</quote>

            And these things this true bondman of God would say with sorrow and
            tears besides many others. But at first he was indeed actually in great
            straits, because he had not supplies sufficient for his abounding willingness;
            but at last, when he had continued for several years, and the fame of his
            practices had been reported all over the city, God also who had seen his love
            used to send him what he needed in abundance, and thenceforth the holy
            old man would contrive not merely to plant his foot in one footprint (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπος</foreign>)
            of the patriarch whom he was desirous of imitating and remain there, but
            would<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n401-1"/> enlarge his steps<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n401-2"/> to run and reach many of his footprints; so that,
            besides the love and alacrity and hospitality which he possessed like him, in
            this also as well he did not fall behind him, that he personally and with his
            own hands performed all the service; and, as the patriarch, when he possessed 
            all that host of bondmen and servants, when he saw the men who
            were received by him as guests, did not order someone else to run to the
            herd to fetch the calf, but ran himself in his old age that he might be the
            receiver of the blessing and not another, so this man with all that advanced
            <pb n="604"/><pb n="402"/>old age used himself to perform all the service of the whole day, though
            many were then living with him in the cell, and he did not allow them to
            wait either upon him or upon anyone, but he himself would wait upon them,
            and often, whenever any necessary service was required, he would himself
            rise from table, and fulfil it; and (a great thing which astonishes many) that<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n402-1"/>
            he would actually himself stand before the cooking-stand every day and
            cook without tiring, having laid down the following law (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>) for himself,
            that, as soon as they had finished nocturns, he would dismiss his companions
            to their bodily rest, and would himself direct his steps to the kitchen, and
            himself begin and cook until morning on account of the poor people who were
            in the habit of coming early, and would put the food together, and make it ready;
            and so he would go out and wake them, and they<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n402-2"/> would rise to matins; and
            as soon as the service was finished they would place tables both within and
            without. Moreover, as if greedy for his great spiritual trade, he did not
            stop at<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n402-3"/> waiting on those who came and went, but he brought <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3685">four blind men</persName>,
            and placed them in his cell at his table; and thenceforth he was not
            to be seen except distributing the food and placing it in the mouth of each
            <pb n="605"/><pb n="403"/>one of them by his name<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n403-1"/>; and, if it were a portion of bread (?)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n403-2"/>, or some herbs,
            or a cup, he would grasp each of them with his hand, calling them by their
            names, and entreating and pressing them to eat, while he also grasped the
            hand of each one of them and made it feel the dish; and again that<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n403-1"/>, if anyone
            soever great or small came to him, there was no possibility of his separating
            his food from theirs, so that many great and distinguished men who used to
            visit him on account of his extreme old age and his extraordinary practices
            and were possessed by friendship for him did not like this that he used to
            make them sit among these <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3685">blind men</persName>; and he on his side paid no heed to
            these men, but these <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3685">blind men</persName> were greater in his eyes than anyone, and
            he used to wait on them as if they were <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, and there was no
            means of distinguishing either his own proper food or that of anyone who
            visited him from them<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n403-3"/> or from all the other guests, but he himself would
            wait both on them and on everyone, and would pour out wine and bring
            hot water, and himself mix it, everyone disliking this on account of his
            venerable old age; and, if anyone made any answer to him or wished to do
            anything instead of him, this is what he would say to him: <quote>I, my brother,
               <pb n="606"/><pb n="404"/>have not insulted you or done you any harm. Wherefore do you insult me?</quote>.
            When then this saint had completed about ten years in the royal city itself,
            since, inasmuch as he had found material for his trade in it, and inasmuch
            moreover as the persecution which was always everywhere did not cease, he
            had now chosen to continue to remain in the city occupied in this labour, we
            ourselves having been in intercourse with him for about twelve years while
            he was following these practices, so then this extraordinary man ended his
            life<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n404-1"/>, having strenuously completed all his days in these great labours, so that,
            when he had become very infirm, and God wished to take him to his abode in
            heaven, and he felt that he was dying, he gave each of his companions a
            present out of his cell as he knew to be suited to him, as well as the furniture
            of the altar, since indeed besides these things his cell was actually a church
            also, and an altar was continuously set ready in it, and a large congregation
            used to assemble before it. And he ordered all that he had to be sold and
            given to the poor; and so it was done. And he departed from this world
            according to the commandment of God.
