            Inasmuch as we learn from the divine Paul who says that in Christ Jesus
            is no male nor female', it has seemed good to us to introduce the history of
            persons also who were by nature females; for the subject of their lives does<pb n="167"/>
            not fall short of the standard of the series of the histories of the saints; since
            neither is the course of life of these persons lower than that of the high
            path in which each one of these walked, but their habits of life also are
            great, and surpass written narratives. These virtuous blessed women then
            were sisters in the body, of whom one, the elder, was called Mary, and one
            Euphemia. But this Mary was a pure virgin, and chose for herself
            from her childhood quietude and renuntiation and great labours of fasting
            and much watching, and constant prayers, and exertion in the way of charity 
            or of pilgrimage. This woman therefore formed the plan of going up to
            Jerusalem, and in the holy country in which the dispensation for the sake of
            the salvation of all was carried out there to worship and return to her
            employment’. When then she had gone up and prayed, she stood before
            the place called Golgotha, and was lifted up with ecstasy, and she remained
            standing there three days and three nights, while men came and saw her;
            and the custodians wished to drive her away; and on seeing that she was a
            feeble old woman, and further that she was standing in prayer they let her
            alone. And from that time she used to sit there in the temple, and again
            she continued going round and praying for three years, without entering
            anyone's house or speaking with human beings. And she did not sleep
            outside the church, or yet ask anything from human beings; but she would sit
            among the poor and pass the night with them, in the church and wherever
            it might be'. And, if it chanced that anyone came and gave charity in the
            place where she happened to be, she would stretch out her hand and receive
            it; and, if the sum received by her reached twenty <foreign>minae</foreign>, she would not
            afterwards accept anything more; and, if she received more than twenty
            <foreign>minae</foreign>, she would give them to someone else; but with these twenty she
            would buy bread for fifteen <foreign>minae</foreign>, and herbs for two, and pulse for three; and
            so whenever it happened to be she would take her food. But, if it chanced
            that no one came to the place where she happened to be, she would sit in
            the same way, and for three and four days, and as much as a week she
            would sit silent, with her mind wrapt up in heaven. Usually her seat was
            in front of Golgotha, while she sat with her eyes raised, and looking<pb n="169"/>
            in ecstatic wonder and weeping, just as if she were looking at God fastened
            to the cross and standing there, with the result that, while she sat there.
            in admiration every day, those who saw her looked upon her as a mad
            woman, or as some old person who had become silly; and thus she
            completed three years there in her praying. And afterwards some persons
            who knew her and were well acquainted with her admirable modes of life
            came thither and found her sitting before Golgotha with her eyes raised and
            looking at it, and weeping with ecstatic wonder. And on seeing her they
            fell down and made obeisance to her, and saluted her; but she was troubled,
            because she did not wish that men should know her there. Then these
            persons told many about the perfect modes of life of the blessed woman
            from her childhood down to her old age, and many marvelled at her. And
            thenceforth those in whose eyes she had been reckoned as a foolish old
            woman, and as if she sat there for the sake of charity in order to live the
            bodily life, began to honour her as a great and holy woman, entreating her
            to pray for them. But the blessed woman when she saw it, inasmuch as she
            was struck with fear lest she should be honoured by men and lose her labour,
            fled thence immediately, being distressed at her expulsion from the holy<pb n="170"/>
            place, inasmuch as she had intended to remain there in that occupation all her
            lifetime. And so she departed, and went down again to the East; and she
            determined that all her life she would once every year offer worship in the
            place where God suffered. And thus she did, travelling along that road in
            the season of extreme heat, and she did not taste anything except every other
            day, while she carried nothing whatever except one small basket (otupída),
            which she fastened to her arm, and one salver; and thus she travelled. And
            she imposed this labour upon herself every year all the days of her life,
            returning and applying herself to constant prayers and supplications and tears,
            all the days of her quiet life; and so she would when her time came again
            return and go up to Jerusalem, and accomplish her vow and come back to
            her usual habits, insomuch that great deeds of power were wrought by her
            presence, not by her will and her words. But she herself shrank greatly
            from such things, and it was not pleasing to her that anyone should say
            anything of the kind to her; and, if anyone wished to press her, he did not see
            her again. For this devout woman guarded herself carefully against pride<pb n="171"/>
            and repressed vain glory, lest she should lose her labour. But her sister
            Euphemia, who was younger than she, had in her childhood been united to
            a husband, and had had one daughter, who herself also had been trained
            from a tender age in religion. But afterwards, since this woman's husband
            had died, Euphemia herself and her little daughter formed the household,
            insomuch that she thenceforward came to herself' from the secular order
            of life, and turned to the practices of her sister which she had been practising
            for a long time, and lived in the order of devoutness and in the religious
            habit (xõp.x), while she also learned the psalms by heart, and taught them
            to her daughter; for her daughter also had while she was a child been
            splendidly trained in the psalms and in the Scriptures and in handwriting.
            And from that time she appointed fixed hours for reciting service and for
            the prayers, those of the night and those of the day; and, while observing
            her sister's asceticism and the rest of her practices, she herself practised
            another high and sublime order of life, while she in fact carried out both,
            the observance of abstinence and the practice of relief of the distressed. But
            this admirable woman decided in her mind not to introduce into her house
            other men's bread that was not gained by the work of her hands; and, if it<pb n="172"/>
            came in, neither she her daughter tasted any of it. But, because they were
            fine and excellent workwomen, they would weave two pounds only of goat's
            wool yarn for a <foreign>denarius</foreign>, which she received from great ladies of the city and
            worked up, buying their small supply of provisions with half of it,
            and assigning the other half to the relief of the poor and the sick and
            the prisoners, while every day she would take cooked food and bread and
            wine to every place where there was anyone in bonds or shut up in prison or
            anywhere else, and again she would go round all the streets of the city, and
            wherever she found a sick man or a cripple, or a blind man or an old man
            who could not stand, she would sit by the side of each one of them and ask
            him, <quote>What, my brother, do you wish? Would you like me to buy you
            some bread and herbs only? Or do you perhaps wish for something else
            instead of this? or do you perhaps wish me to go and buy you some fine
            wheaten bread?</quote> And, whatever the man, whoever he might be, said, if
            her head-covering was in its place', she did not leave him till she had satisfied
            him. And, if she had no coppers at hand, she would run to her house and
            take some article of their furniture and go and pawn it, and thus she would<pb n="173"/>
            satisfy that indigent man; and there could not be any sick poor man among
            those lying in the streets who escaped her so that she did not visit him either
            twice or once in the day, inasmuch as she was capable of running about all
            day. But she would go round the courts of the houses and ask, <quote>Is there
            here a needy orphan, or a poor old sick widow?</quote>. And so in the case of
            everyone whom she found sick, according to the extent of her possessions she
            would buy for him, fine wheaten bread and fruit, and wine for anyone for
            whom she knew it to be proper, and would go round and distribute it to
            them. And, if it happened that she had not by her wherewithal to satisfy
            any man whoever he might be as was proper, nothing whatever would prevent
            her from at least bringing him apples or pomegranates or fish or bread, and
            sitting by him and taking him by the hand, and asking him <quote>What has
            afflicted you, my son?</quote>, admonishing and saying, <quote>Be not dejected because
            you are in distress and have no consolation. Blessed are you for the number
            of unending blessings that are prepared for you in that world, in return for
            these distresses which are passing by upon you. Look at Lazarus, how
            because he endured and was patient and did not murmur he inherited the<pb n="174"/>
            kingdom of heaven.</quote> And so the poor used to call her <quote>our comfort and our
            visitor</quote>. Blessed truly is that soul for the number of souls that are laden
            with gratitude to her and with her bounties, like those of the original Tabitha,
            and display them to God the all-seeing; and accordingly this woman was
            called Tabitha all over the city. And, when all the high-placed men and
            women of the city saw her strenuousness and her zeal, and saw that she was
            distressed because she could not visit the distressed in a liberal fashion,
            everyone who was earnest in seeking what was for the good of his life used
            to entreat her to go and take everything that she knew to be required by her
            for the relief of the afflicted and visit them; and thus she was henceforth
            free from anxiety, because on both points she was much distressed,
            one that she was unable to relieve the sick and needy out of their
            small amount of labour, and another that she had not leisure to devote
            herself to the employment which she had taken upon herself, the work of
            her hands, except at night. And therefore her daughter laboured simple-mindedly 
            and without murmuring night and day, and she would say if any
            of her companions or anyone else said to her, <quote>Your mother leaves you to<pb n="175"/>
            work alone all day</quote>, she on her part would say', <quote>My mother's labour is
            greater than all labours; and I receive strength from God through her
            prayers.</quote> And therefore this blessed woman had a little freedom from
            anxiety, since her daughter laboured for their own necessities, and as far as
            they were able she supplied the needy, and she herself without much
            solicitude carried out the ministration to the distressed and needy and
            afflicted all the day, and alterwards she would further gather them together
            at her house every day and relieve them out of their labour. And in consequence 
            many would entreat her to accept what was required for her own
            necessities and those of her daughter, and she would not consent, saying,
            <quote>May the Lord save me from eating the strength of human beings,
            and gratifying my body out of the toil of others while it is strong enough to
            work, and receiving in my spirit the stains of their sins</quote>. But, if anyone
            pressed her on the other side, she was displeased and would say, <quote>A truce
            to this charity of yours, since you wish to pollute me with the mire of your
            sins; my own blots are sufficient for me. God puts strength in me and in
            that poor girl who is with me, both to work for our necessities, and to<pb n="176"/>
            minister to our brethren according to our power.</quote> And so they never ate
            except from the proceeds of their labour in their house, unless perhaps one of
            them might be constrained on some occasion to perform an act of friendship'
            somewhere. But in this way they were continually occupied in this labour; and
            moreover in fasting also and prayer, and the recital of service; and, whenever
            the blessed woman was engaged outside in ministering to the needy, she would
            perform her office (xav6v) in the street while going from one to another, and
            likewise also did her daughter too at home as well, and at vespers, nocturns,
            and matins they recited service together. While then this blessed woman
            was with all her power running in the line of these great practices and in this
            perfect course of life, neither did she miss the great benefit derived from
            another labour, in order that the saying of the Lord to the man who had the
            five talents who said, <quote>He that hath to him shall be given</quote>?, might be
            fulfilled; but, when the persecution took place, and all the convents round
            the city were expelled from their places, and the adversaries occupied them,
            then that blessed woman, like a harbour (22p:6v) which receives ships from all<pb n="177"/>
            sides that they may lie to and be at peace in it, so herself also received and
            relieved the persecuted and afflicted from every place; and, because there was
            no place for the convents to enter away from the heretics, they were
            constrained to find quarters with her as with a devout woman renowned for
            her manner of life. But she found means, and hired spacious rooms; and one
            which was suited and adapted for the purpose and of great size she turned
            into an imitation of a martyrs' chapel, with likenesses and pictures, and
            chests', and everything, while the oblation also and the Scriptures and
            everything that is proper to a monastery were in it; and she prepared great
            mats also, and curtains and rugs. And for herself and her daughter she
            made provision in a certain inner chamber; and being a very wise woman
            she alone devoted herself to ministration with the blessed men, and her
            daughter, because she was a child, she would keep in security within by
            day and’ by night, lest by the sight of her she should harm anyone, or be
            herself harmed by anyone through the sight. And so from that time that
            martyrs' chapel harboured not fewer than ten or fifteen, and as many as
            twenty, while with the labour of their hands which they disposed of outside<pb n="178"/>
            she would therefore buy wheat and lentils and herbs, and make bread and
            cook lentils and herbs from evening to evening, and thus she would relieve
            them, as many as came, while she herself was occupied in her ministration
            the whole day, and moreover also the blessed men too were ceaselessly
            remitting (?) matters to her'. When accordingly they came to her from all
            quarters on account of her love toward God, and the produce of their labour
            was too small to provide for them, she was compelled, in order to relieve their
            distresses, for their sake to accept what was necessary for them, while she
            never joined them in tasting of it. And, if it happened that there were some
            reverend men among them who constrained her to receive the blessing with
            them, she would bring a triple portion? of her bread and all that she
            required and set it before her, and so cat. But, if it happened that strangers
            whom she knew to be in need and not known in the city came, she would
            go out and go to some persons of high position, and make instant demands
            of them, saying: <quote>A mighty matter it is that you do toward Christ,
            whose property all your good things are. And now lo! you are smearing off<pb n="179"/>
            your superfluities on him, and you think that your charity is great. <quote>Woe
            to you, rich men; wail and weep for the calamities that are coming upon
            you</quote>'</quote>. And in accordance with the text <quote>The righteous is bold as a
            lion</quote>?, so this zealous woman would boldly rebuke everyone without fear of
            persons, insomuch that the high-placed men and women of the city were
            afraid of her, and, as soon as she was going up to the threshold and they heard
            that Euphemia was coming up, they would say, <quote>Woe to us; Tabitha has
            come upon us to smite us</quote>. And so therefore she would boldly take all
            that she wanted to give to anyone who was in need, to the blessed guests or
            to sick widows and orphans and needy persons, or perhaps sick men, and
            go down. But, if anyone was recalcitrant and did not give cheerfully, she
            would make him rue the day by her words, saying, <quote>Is it well that you
            thus sit yourself while slaves stand and wait upon you, and enjoy a variety
            of tastes in dainty foods and in wines, and of pure bread and splendid rugs,
            while God is knocked down in the street and swarms with lice and faints from
            his hunger, and you do not fear him? and how will you call upon him and
            he answer you, when you treat him with such contempt? Or how will you<pb n="180"/>
            ask forgiveness from him? Or how can you expect him to deliver you from
            hell?</quote> And thus she would pass judgment upon them, so that those who
            were secular (?) were a little offended against her in accordance with the
            saying <quote>The fool loveth not one who reproveth him</quote>'. But she herself was
            so earnestly bent on relieving at all costs distressed and afflicted souls who
            lacked human comfort and satisfying their needs that even the whole city
            did not suffice for her business, but she would even go round the inns and
            roads and habitations outside also and search, lest there should be any needy
            man or stranger laid up sick in one of them, so that she in fact found many
            and relieved them. And some she took into her house, and some she carried
            to superintendents of hospitals, and gave charge concerning them, and it was
            chiefly on her account that they were received and tended; for she was
            known to great and small in the city, and everyone recognised her on seeing
            her even at a distance by her quick and rapid walk, since she would walk in
            this way summer and winter in mud and snow and frost without anything
            whatever on her feet, with her toes bruised and her nails torn out and the<pb n="181"/>
            blood flowing from her wounds, and she would not consent even to treat them,
            while everyone was very sorry for her on account of the state in which they
            saw her; for indeed we ourselves too would often jest with her and say to her,
               <quote>Do not kill yourself in so cruel a way, Tabitha</quote>; but she would say:
               <quote>When the end of a thing is corruption and the worm, wherefore do we
                  preserve it?</quote> And she was so energetic in her task that the mouth is too
            small to tell the story of her great labour; for, just as her sister Mary in the
            city of Thella was celebrated for her perfect practices of asceticism and
            quietude and renuntiation, so was this woman also in the city of Amida; so
            that the fame of these sisters was spoken all over the East, everyone being
            wrapt in wonder to think how each of them in one peerless mode of life was
            strenuously applying herself to store up righteousness. When then the
            blessed woman had completed a period of thirty years more or less in such
            practices, and her house thundered night and day with the praises of the<pb n="182"/>
            saints from all quarters, Satan who is always envious of good things did not
            neglect to stir up a trial against them, in order to make them lose the benefit
            of their great and spiritual business and deprive them of it. Then he stirred
            up against them the heretical envy of those who held power in the church,
            cruelly and savagely and mercilessly, in that they said, <quote>These women are
            disturbing this city, and the citizens fear and honour them more than the
            bishops; since their house has been made a cave of robbers', and they
            receive and shelter the deceivers</quote>. And they sent and arrested them and
            brought them into the church, in order to make them communicants in their
            impiety. When they had brought many inducements to bear upon them
            both in the way of threats and in the way of blandishments and they did not
            yield, but the blessed woman in confidence that fights with death even used
            vehement language, saying, <quote>As for me, may the Lord Jesus Christ deliver
            me from communicating with those who divide him, and with those who
            proclaim a quaternity in place of the Holy Trinity</quote>?, and, when those who<pb n="183"/>
            deserved these words had heard them, they were seized with furious,
            vehement, passionate indignation, and they ordered the blessed woman to
            be confined in the lowest dungeon of the prison as a punishment for <quote>this
            audacity</quote>. And so she was confined for thirty days in the dungeon, while
            the whole city entreated that she might be released; and they bound
            themselves under a curse that she should not come up thence till she received
            the oblation there. And, when she heard it, she would mock at them, and
            say: <quote>Would that I might undergo sufferings in return for the suffering of
            him who suffered for my sake on the cross. I am glad to die here rather
            than to die in denial of my Lord and my God</quote>. And, when they saw
            that it was impossible, and the whole city was grieved on her account,
            they released her and expelled her from the whole city; which also
            Satan had been contriving to bring about. And then all the poor of the
            city were oppressed with sorrow and great aflliction, insomuch that' all the
            people of high position were distressed. But they left, and went to her
            blessed sister Mary, and it was their wish to go up to Jerusalem; and they
            went up and prayed, and returned. And so these blessed women were
            buffeted by the trials (özóv) of persecution for five years; and, having
            received one another’s blessing, afterwards, thinking that the fury against<pb n="184"/>
            them had perhaps abated, they returned to Amida and came in secretly, and
            they resided in a certain gentleman's house. And, when it began to
            become known, and the adversaries began to speak about them, those
            in whose house they were residing were alarmed, and they besought them
            to depart, lest (as they said) their house should be plundered. But the
            blessed woman was distressed; and she cried to God, and said: <quote>My Lord,
            thy mercy knoweth that I have grown feeble, and there is no more strength
            in me. It is sufficient for me</quote>. And the same night a summons was sent
            forth for the blessed woman according to the request of her prayer, and she
            fell into a sickness; and, while these people were troubled on her account
            and in fear, she called them, and says to them: <quote>Be not dismayed, my
            children; for I shall go out from among you' this week assuredly</quote>. But
            they did not understand her words, to what departure she referred. And she
            called her daughter, who was called Maria, and said to her: <quote>My daughter,
            be comforted in Christ, and keep yourself in purity for the Lord your Lord to
            whom you were betrothed; and be not distressed, for I am not deserting you
            (far be it from me, my beloved); but I am committing you to the Child of my<pb n="185"/>
            blessed Lady Maria, and to the holy one herself, that by her prayers you
            may be preserved, and may become a temple for the indwelling of the Holy
            Spirit of God</quote>. And after laying many charges upon her, and saying
            positively, <quote>I for my part am going to Christ</quote>, and committing her to the
            divine grace, while speaking, she stretched out her hand, and made the sign
            over her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; and she extended herself and
            looked toward heaven, and, while her eyes were raised toward heaven, her
            soul passed away, while everyone was seized with amazement at her departure;
            and her daughter remained alone solitary and bereaved. And on the next
            day but one after her mother's departure, while she was in misery and was
            sitting in her grief, and she also was near passing away from life, lo! a man
            came bearing a letter from the blessed Mary, who had passed from the world
            to God ten days before. And certain persons on it coming to their knowledge
            prevented her niece from hearing it and her soul flitting from sorrow, since
            her whole hope was now this, to go to her blessed aunt, and share her manner
            of life until her end. And for this reason they prevented it, lest she should
            hear the news and be overwhelmed with anguish. These saints therefore in<pb n="186"/>
            this way both finished their marvellous courses together within eight days,
            each of them carrying the great load of her merchandise. The blessed Mary
            completed sixty years in the course of sanctity from her birth down to her
            departure, walking in the road of perfection, and labouring toward God;
            while, as for the blessed Euphemia, she too accomplished thirty-five years in
            this course of perfection, thirty in ministering to the saints, and five in the
            afflictions and the conflict (egów) of persecution', that is of martyrdom for
            Christ's sake. And her blessed daughter yet remained, strengthened by the
            power of her blessing and of her prayer, while she too followed closely in
            the footsteps of these saints, and began after them to take up the strict course
            of their practices.
