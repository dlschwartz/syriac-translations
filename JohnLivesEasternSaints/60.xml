         <head>A Writing of Mar Cyriac Bishop of <placeName>Amrna</placeName> About the Same Holy Mar <persName>James</persName></head>
         <p>
            When then Mar <persName>James</persName> the bishop from the holy convent of <placeName>Fsiltha</placeName> had
            departed to our Lord a considerable time before, and the patriarch Mar
            <persName>Athanasius</persName> had arisen upon the see of <persName>Peter</persName> the great<note></note>, <persName>Phocas</persName> king of the
            <persName>Romans</persName> again expelled the orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξοι</foreign>) bishops from their sees and
            appointed heretics, but by the judgments of God the Persian king Khosrau
            <pb n="269"/><pb n="615"/>son of <persName>Hormizd</persName> came and took all the country east of the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName> in war<note></note>;
            and by God's provision and queen <persName>Shirin</persName>'s advice he expelled the bishops
            of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName> from the cities east of the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>, and appointed orthodox
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξοι</foreign>) bishops in their places, viz. in <placeName>Amida</placeName> Mar <persName>Samuel</persName>, and in <placeName>Edessa</placeName>
            Mar <persName>Isaiah</persName>, and in <placeName>Rhesaina</placeName> Mar <persName>Addai</persName>, and in <placeName>Thella</placeName> Mar <persName>Zakkhai</persName>; and so
            in every district and city<note></note>, while they agreed in everything with the blessed
            patriarch. At this same time therefore, when Mar <persName>Zakkhai</persName> bishop of <placeName>Thella</placeName>
            had heard and learned of the holiness of the blessed Mar <persName>James</persName>, he was
            zealous for the Lord and for that holy soul and exerted and bestirred himself,
            and sent four blessed men from his convent, and two of the clergymen of the
            city (and he supplied them with a swift animal and money) to go to the monastery
            of <placeName>Casium</placeName> in which he fell asleep, and steal him thence. And he laid
            down a law (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>) for them as to how they should act and dispatched them.
            Now those who went were sent in the year nine hundred and thirty-three of the
            <persName>Greeks</persName><note></note>. And at the same time <persName>Heraclius</persName> king of the <persName>Romans</persName><note></note> came, and
            took all the country east of the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>, and drove the <persName>Persians</persName> as far as
            <pb n="270"/><pb n="616"/><placeName>Nisibis</placeName> which is on the frontier<note></note>. And the members of the monastery went
            in the days of the devout Mar <persName>Stephen</persName> who was termed Shbiliya<note></note>; and, having
            gone and arrived at the monastery of <placeName>Casium</placeName>, they went into the monastery
            and prayed and came near and were blessed by the holy Mar <persName>James</persName>, and
            by the brothers of the house. And on being asked whither they were
            travelling they answered <quote>We are envoys of the church of <placeName>Syria</placeName> to the pope.
               of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>.</quote> Then they were received with much honour. When then
            they had remained there two days, in accordance with a plan and trick that
            had been concerted by them on the way, one of these monks, the envoys,
            set up a wail being possessed by a demon<note></note> and foaming and went out of his
            mind<note></note>. And his companions began to be distressed and weep; and in
            sorrow they went on to fasten their companion to the sarcophagus of the
            <pb n="271"/><pb n="617"/>holy Mar <persName>James</persName>, in order that he might learn how<note></note> to steal that holy body,
            while his companions on his account slept<note></note> with him close by the sarcophagus 
            itself. But during the night they would bore, and in the day cover the
            borings that they had made. And, when the task had become easy for them,
            they took the keys (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κλείδα</foreign>) of the monastery to themselves, that their task
            might be easily accomplished<note></note>. Then they said to the members of the
            monastery of <placeName>Casium</placeName>, <quote>We, sirs", since we have a letter with us, cannot
               remain here with this sick man"; but we will leave one of us with him and
               a swift animal, in order that, when the Lord pleases and he recovers, he may
               quickly join us at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, in the holy convent of <placeName>Marth Zoila</placeName>, but pray
               for us</quote>. And, having gone thence, they came as far as <placeName>Palestine</placeName> on their
            return; and the man who had feigned madness and his companion rose by
            night and took the body of the holy Mar <persName>James</persName>, and wrapped it in silk
            shrouds, and came on the swift animal to their companions in <placeName>Palestine</placeName>
            according to the agreement that they had made with one another.
         </p>
         <pb n="272"/><pb n="618"/>
         <p>
            But the blessed men the members of the monastery of <placeName>Casium</placeName>, when
            they rose in the morning and saw that the saint's body had been taken
            away, lifted up their voice in weeping and in sobs; and they went in all
            directions after them, and did not find them<note></note>; and they returned to their
            monastery mourning. But the blessed men departed from <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, themselves 
            and the clergymen, and rapidly arrived at the city of <placeName>Thella</placeName>, carrying 
            his holy body with them. And, when the bishop<note></note> and the clergy
            and the citizens<note></note> heard of it, they went to meet it with lights and incense
            and songs of praise, and carried it round the whole city, accompanying it
            with spiritual odes, and chants of the Holy Spirit. And then they<note></note> wrapped
            it round and laid it in his monastery, the convent of <placeName>Fsiltha</placeName>, in the temple
            which the saint had built in his lifetime<note></note>, and it is there for the assistance
            and healing of all men, and for the honour and praise of Christ his<note></note> God;
            <pb n="273"/><pb n="619"/>to whom and to his<note></note> Father with his Holy Spirit be praise and honour
            and worship and exaltation, now and always and<note></note> for ever and ever. Amen!
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of Mar <persName>James</persName> bishop of <placeName>Edessa</placeName><note></note> is ended.

            This history was written by the industry of Mar <persName>Theodosius</persName> presbyter and

            of the same convent, in the year a thousand and fifty-two
