         <head>Next the Fourteenth History, of the Blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1536">Abbi the Man of Abnegation and Nazirite</persName>.</head>
         <p>
            This blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1536">Abbi</persName> lived in a certain convent in great abnegation and
            abstinence, and severe labours. And, when the persecution on account of
            the synod of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName> arose, the inmates of his convent were under the
            <pb n="214"/><pb n="214"/>compulsion of the persecutors united to their communion; but in the case of
            the holy old man, as they were unable to bring down his high purpose that
            was set on <persName>Christ</persName>, they gave him a charge, saying, <quote>If you will not yield,
               since you have been made an example to many, withdraw yourself hence
               whither you please</quote>. Then the old man, weeping for the time of error that
            had got possession of men, set forth and came to the community of us <persName>the
            men of Amida</persName>, which was living in the district of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2858">Ṭyšf</placeName>, in a village called
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2796">Ḥzyn</placeName><note></note>; which was in number seven hundred and fifty men. And, because
            this blessed man was acquainted with the convent in which I was at that
            time?, he came direct to us; and thus he attached himself to the same monastery, 
            having one tunic and one cape made of pieces of rag fastened together,
            and a small text of the gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγελιον</foreign>); and he would not consent to read
            in any other book except that gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγελιον</foreign>). And he chose for himself
            a certain corner (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>) among the brotherhood, where not much light pene<pb n="215"/><pb n="215"/>trated; 
            and at the end of the service, when the brotherhood was scattered
            over a large number of chambers for the purpose of reading as well as for
            the purpose of repeating the service, he would sit in the great common (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κοινόν</foreign>)
            chapel and cover his head with his book on his knees, while even the book
            also was covered, and except a small surface only for the purpose of admitting 
            light no part whatever of it was exposed. And thereupon he would
            open the book and gaze at it, and at once his tears would burst forth, falling
            down upon his breast; and thus he would sit from morning till the sixth
            hour<note></note>, with his face covered, and weeping; and he would not turn over a
            leaf, but generally had the book open at the beatitudes, or the parable of the
            virgins, or that of the talents, or that of the banquet, or that of the rich
            man, or any place where the subject was that of threats and judgment; and
            thenceforth not even if a man was actually speaking to him would be raise
            his eyes and look upon men outside that book; but men did not see his face
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) until the bellman sounded the bell, nay not even then also; for
            <pb n="216"/><pb n="216"/>even during service too he would again stand in this way in the same corner
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>) with his head bowed and covered, and after every sentence that came
            out of his mouth he would utter an expression of praise with ecstasy.
            And he used to keep silence the whole day, not speaking to men at all, no
            not even if anyone spoke to him. But, if any kind of occasion called him
            to speak, he would weep while speaking; and, even if one of the seniors
            came up to him and said to him, <quote>Wherefore, our father, are you exceedingly 
               mournful, and do not speak and enjoy yourself a little?</quote>, he on
            his side would thus answer: <quote>Why do you desire a dead man who is dead
               in his sins and buried in his body to speak? For me whom you see my body
               is a grave; for, like a rotting corpse in a grave, thus my soul is rotting
               within it in sin; and henceforth over the dead man there is mourning only
               and weeping</quote>. And even these words he would say with many sobs.
            And in the same way his food also which he took at table did not go down
            <pb n="217"/><pb n="217"/>into his belly unless mixed with tears; and at night again the same. And
            so this blessed man used in truth to sorrow disconsolately, like a woman
            girt in sackcloth for the husband of her tender age in the first days of her
            mourning. When the time came round when he received clothes, all
            the blessed men would entreat him to change that old garment of his, and
            he would not agree; but, when he was forced by the quantity of vermin,
            for two or three days, while he was seething it in hot water and it was
            drying, he would consent to put on another; and again, when he was
            forced by the cold, he would for a few days cover himself with a cloak
            supplied out of kindness, and would return it to its owner with an apology.
            And thus he spent his life in this practice of great mourning. And, because 
            he used to see in my case that my soul loved and clave to anyone
            in whom I saw anything of this kind, and I for my part had not yet subdued
            the wild impulse of youth, then he would each time take me apart, and
            open that book, and with tears warn me out of it, saying, <quote>Come, hear, my
               son, how many secret blessings and promises are guaranteed to the pure and
               the virgins and the pure in heart, and to boys like you who draw near to the
               <pb n="218"/><pb n="218"/>Lord'; and guard your purity, and keep virginity, which beyond all things
               has magnified and glorified its possessors; and see moreover what a threat
               and sentence of weeping and gnashing of teeth, and an immortal worm and
               unsleeping fire and darkness are threatened against the wicked and the
               presumptuous and the doers of sin; and fear, and be wary</quote>. And these
            words again he would speak to me with a flood of tears. But one day I
            presumed to say to him: <quote>Why, sir, do you tell me to perform acts of
               righteousness? If I go to do anything, lo! you seniors laugh at us, and say:
               <quote>If you see a boy going up to heaven, catch hold of his foot</quote>. And what
               therefore can we do?</quote> But the saint, looking at me and shaking his head,
            said to me: <quote>Know, my son, that a lion who does not tear the prey in his
               second year will not afterwards quickly tear it. And know this further, that
               childhood, like tender wax which receives the impress of that which falls
               from the ring upon it, so itself also from the beginning receives the impress
               <pb n="219"/><pb n="219"/>and the picture of that which is impressed upon it, be it of good things or
               of evil</quote>. And after these words I said to him: <quote>What, my father, do you
                  command me to do? What will be for my good?</quote> The old man says to
            me: <quote>Lo!, my son, <persName>Jesus</persName> your Lord tells you here and shows you what is
               the great and first commandment: <quote>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
                  all thine heart, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind</quote>; and the
               second which is like it, <quote>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</quote><note></note>. He has
               again in his own person shown you humility, and commanded you: <quote>Whoever 
                  shall smite thee on thy cheek, turn to him the other also</quote>?, together with
               the other commandments. These things, O my son, which God himself your
               Creator taught you, keep and you shall live'</quote>. And thus he would warn
            me with many words every day; and I, when I should have used the saying
            of the psalmist against evil, here on the contrary drew it to me, and <quote>as a
               deaf man heard not</quote><note></note>. The blessed man from the time when he came to us
            completed nine years in this employment; and so he will receive his Lord
            <pb n="220"/><pb n="220"/>with a load of joy, in order that the text may be fulfilled, <quote>They who sow
               in tears shall reap in joy</quote><note></note>; so that from the time when I myself came to
            know this old man of abnegation down to his passing away not one moment
            passed in which he was not sowing the tears of sorrow.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1536">Abbi</persName> the man of abnegation is ended.
