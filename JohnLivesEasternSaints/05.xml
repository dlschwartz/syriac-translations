         <head>Next the Fifth History of the Holy and Divine Men <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2095">Simeon</persName>, The
            Recluse and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> Also the Recluse His Zealous Disciple.</head>
         <p>
            In the same village moreover from which the saints of the column derived
            <pb n="85"/><pb n="85"/>their origin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>)' a great and holy old man who was called <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2095">Simeon</persName> had
            also been living as a recluse ever since the time when the saints <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3184">Abraham</persName>
            and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> the brothers began their discipleship’, a man whose own storym
            also was not unworthy of great admiration; who also in his own person
            carried out the words of the apostle which say, <quote>They crucified their flesh
               with all its affections and its lusts</quote>?. This man because of the great 
            hospitality that existed in him (and he was eager to carry out the ministration to
            the saints personally with his own hands like the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3184">Abraham</persName> the patriarch)
            used not to shut himself up in a hut like all the others, because indeed as
            I have said he would not endure to do so, since he used to perform the
            ministration to the brothers who resorted to him. For the love of the great
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3184">Abraham</persName> had been implanted in him toward all men, and on this account
            he made himself some small huts, and a little enclosed court and garden
            without a gate; and thus he was shut up within them with one disciple or <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3686">jew</persName>
            two; and at one place he made for himself a way of ascending and descending
            the wall, on account of the strange brothers who resorted to him; and thus
            therefore he fulfilled in himself two purposes, both that of seclusion and
            <pb n="86"/><pb n="86"/>that of the entertainment of strangers. Whenever any stranger wearing the
            habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) came to him, he would himself open the gate at the top of the
            wall for him, and he would come up outside and come down to him; and he
            would take hold of him and embrace him and kiss his hands; and he would
            fall upon his face and forcibly take hold of him, and would kiss his feet and
            his heels, leaping and crying and saying, <quote>I thank my Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> that he
               has come to-day and visited the sinner, and has thought me worthy to see
               him in his holy bondmen</quote>. And, as soon as they had made the prayer
            and were sitting down, he would run to a vessel containing wine, and would
            fill a certain gourd-cup that had been made by him and a roll (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κολλύρα</foreign>)',
            and before anything else would fall on his face before the man's feet whoever
            he might be, that he might take that cup; and the hospitable man would
            invite him to eat that roll (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κολλύρα</foreign>) also, saying to him, <quote>You are weary; but
               for God's sake be kind and take this first</quote>. And, while that man was
            receiving it, he himself would run and prepare a footpan (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λεκάνη</foreign>) and bring water,
            and would prepare a towel and put it round his loins, in the manner which
            our Lord also taught; and thus he would wash them whether they were one
            <pb n="87"/><pb n="87"/>or many, not allowing them to speak nor to refuse. And, alter he had
            washed them, he would hastily raise this water to his own face and his
            arms, just as if he were desirous of washing; and, that no one might 
            understand what he was doing, he would withdraw to one side while these men
            were occupied in conversation; and he would drink of it three times, and then
            leave them; and he would go and pour out wine and oil and anoint them. And
            immediately he would run to that garden, which measured about ten cubits
            one way, and about twenty the other (and the heavenly blessing rested upon
            the place to such an extent that what was sown in it was enough for forty
            men), and he would bring something from it and cook a dish, and then he
            would entertain whoever might be there, and he would make merry and
            joyfully eat and drink, so that anyone who was not acquainted with the
            saint's love and his manner of life would think that he enjoyed himself in
            this way every day. But he would say in cheerful exultation, <quote>Blessed
               am I that I am to-day eating and drinking with my Lord <persName>Jesus</persName></quote>. For, 
            whenever there was a stranger with him, he would thus joyfully eat and drink
            without reserve; and, as soon as there was no stranger, he would go as
            <pb n="88"/><pb n="88"/>much as six and seven and even ten days, and taste nothing, saying, <quote>For
               my part without King <persName>Christ</persName> I cannot eat bread, unless he has thought me
               worthy to sit at table with him in his bondmen</quote>. Many were deterred by
            him from going in to him on account of his reverend character and on account
            of his great humility in their presence; others again who were a little lazy like
            me could not pass more than two nights or three at most with him, on account
            of his great watching and protracted recitation of service; for there was no
            possibility of his sleeping more than two hours of the night; but he would
            stand up in the night and lift up the head of <persName>David</persName>, and, until the day broke,
            where he began there he would end<note></note>; and, if it happened that he had some
            time over, he would leave the brothers resting, and would himself go and
            recite the gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγέλιον</foreign>) in the hut, weeping, until daybreak, and then he
            would go and rouse them to and rouse them to perform matins. And so this wonderful man
            ended his days in this severe labour and abundant love and great earnestness,
            showing fortitude all the days of his life, so that men were not able to support
            and endure the burden of his great labours more than a short time, except
            <pb n="89"/><pb n="89"/><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> his disciple an earnest man like himself, who also imitated him in
            everything, for for the space of twenty years he laboured with him in the
            excellent life, and accordingly the saying of the Spirit that<note></note> was uttered in the
            prophet as from the mouth of the Lord, <quote>This is my rest with which I will
               rest the weary</quote> was fulfilled in the splendid old man and his diligent son,
            insomuch that they made a guest-house outside, and there used to entertain
            all who came with everything out of the window, whether they were women
            or laymen, each as was proper for him. Again also, since the task of
            performing anything in the way of manual work was not open to them, and
            that they might not continue to eat the bread of idleness, and be despised
            by themselves and by their conscience, the blessed men formed a plan and
            chose for themselves to teach boys, and this they did out of the window,
            since a seat was placed inside the window, and hours were appointed for
            the boys to come, that is in the morning and in the evening; and, when they
            had taught one class (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχολή</foreign>) to read the psalms and the Scriptures, and<note></note>
            they bad withdrawn after being strengthened, another came in of little infants,
            thirty or forty of them, and they would learn and go to their homes, because
            <pb n="90"/><pb n="90"/>it was a populous village, and many people used to come out from it. And
            so the old man continued doing until the time of his end; and accordingly
            the boy-pupils supplied their needs. After a space of twenty years <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName>
            his disciple asked the saint that he also might shut himself up at a certain
            place close by the village. And, seeing that he was eager for every good
            deed, he said to him: <quote>I, my son, should not be at all satisfied at your
               leaving me. However, I will not as it were stand in your way so as to
               prevent you from making progress in running on the road of righteousness
               as far as you are able; but go and may our Lord prosper you</quote>. Then,
            having received this permission, he went out and went and shut himself up,
            not after his master's method, but straitly in a lonely hut the size of his
            stature, yes and even smaller than his stature; and there henceforth he
            performed the rest of his labours. But, before doing this, because there
            were many <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3686">Jews</persName> in that village, and they went about with great freedom
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>), he carried on a continuous contest against them, and every day he
            used to contend against them as with slayers of God, being fervent in the
            love of his Lord, and gnashing his teeth, and saying: <quote>These crucifiers of the
               <pb n="91"/><pb n="91"/>Son of God should not be allowed to live at all</quote>; and he used to upbraid
            Christians who had dealings with them in the way of taking and giving. And
            one day he led about twenty of their disciples by night, and took fire, and went
            and burnt their great synagogue-house, with their books and their trumpets
            and all their furniture, saying, <quote>As for those who crucified my Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>,
               I will never make peace with them</quote>. But these men, when they saw that
            all their hope had been cut off through the burning of their books and of all
            their furniture, lamented bitterly; and, because they were settled in the territory<note></note> 
            of the church of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2737">Amida</placeName>, and used to pay many contributions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συντελείας</foreign>)
            to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3687">the members of the church</persName>, out of desire for the abundance of their gold
            all <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3687">the members of the church</persName> became their supporters, threatening the
            blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> and saying: <quote>This man wishes to destroy the property of
               the church</quote>. But the zealous man, when these men had gone into the
            church of the city to prefer an accusation, while the fire was still in their
            synagogue, collected all his master's disciples with him and all the others
            from the village, and they took water, and went and put out that fire; and
            they cleared all the soil; and they collected stones, and within three
            days built a small martyr's chapel in that place, in the name of the Blessed
            <pb n="92"/><pb n="92"/>God-bearer; and, at the end of one week the whole of the martyr's chapel
            was completed, while the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3686">Jews</persName> assembled and looked on and lamented, not
            knowing what to do; and that synagogue remained a martyr's chapel for
            ever. Then the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3686">Jews</persName> who had gone in to prefer accusation against them
            took courage and came to fight with the blessed men; since the old man
            also did not hold aloof from the fight with them<note></note>, though he did not take it
            to heart, that is, he was not moved with indignation. When they saw that
            all hope for their place of worship was lost, and it had now received the
            form of a church, and the name too of the Blessed one, and they were no
            longer able to approach it, inasmuch as they had been reinforced by those
            in whose territory they were settled, they also took fire by night and went
            and set fire to the old man's huts, before his disciple separated from him,
            and burnt them; though perhaps even this also was brought about provientially 
            by the grace of God, in order that the blessed man might have a
            little breathing-space in his huts, because he was much straitened in them.
            Then <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName>, because he was an agile and energetic man, rebuilt them
            firmly in a few days. And, when these men began to build a synagogue,
            <pb n="93"/><pb n="93"/>he waited for them till they were on the point of finishing, and he occupied
            one night in pulling it to pieces stone by stone, and thus he engaged in this
            contest against the crucifiers before shutting himself up; so that during the
            days of his life the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3686">Jews</persName> could not raise their head there. But, when they
            saw that he had shut himself up, they thought that they were rid of him;
            and for this reason they went on building confidently; and, when they had
            completed and finished<note></note>, he sent his disciples by night, and they burnt it;
            and so they desisted from building all the days of his life. But the old man
            went on adding to the course of his habitual practices and to his love
            toward God and toward strangers every day, until he grew old and became
            very infirm, after completing forty years in these huts and in seclusion and
            labours; and at last he became emaciated and was not able to stand unless
            they supported him; and so he was laid upon his rug and recited the service
            night and day; and, as soon as he saw a stranger, he would twine his hands
            together above his head, and weep with sighs, sobbing and weeping like a
            baby. And, because I knew the power of the old man's prayers and of his
            blessings, I always used to repair to him from all quarters to receive his
            blessings, so that once I did not shrink from making the effort and coming
            <pb n="94"/><pb n="94"/>down even from <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>', in order to gain his blessing before his
            departure from the body; and the merciful God, who saw the desire of my
            feebleness, preserved him in the body till he had made me heir to a small
            portion of his goods, though I for my part turned out a squanderer of his
            property. I found that for one year he had been laid up with disease of
            the liver and of the spleen and of all the internal organs, insomuch that the
            breath which came up from inside him used to cause his tongue to dry up,
            and cracks appeared on it, as on a barefooted man's heel. When he heard
            that I had come in to him and saw me, he went on for an hour embracing
            me and weeping, and unable to speak; and he beckoned and they brought
            him water, and he took some on his finger and wetted his tongue; and he
            took oil and smeared it on it while we both wept; and then he spoke and
            said, <quote>Now that I have seen my son, let me die</quote>. After I had spent a few
            days with him, some strangers came to him; and, when he saw them, he
            placed both his hands on his head, and went on weeping. And I said to
            him: <quote>Wherefore do you weep, our father?</quote>, and he looked at me; and his
            tears went on flowing more than before; and in the midst of his sighs he said
            <pb n="95"/><pb n="95"/>to me these words: <quote>How, my son, can I do aught but weep for my wretched
               self, since <persName>Christ</persName> comes to me on his own feet, and I cannot rise and
               wash them and drink</quote>. But I, in order that he might be comforted, was
            staying to him: <quote>Be not distressed at this, our father. When <persName>Christ</persName> wished,
               you washed him as much as he wished. And now his will be done. And
               your own will also he knows, and will not do you wrong, weep not</quote>. But
            he said to me: <quote>He, my son, has not done wrong and does not do wrong;
               but I am a doer of wrong and one who have done him wrong, and who am
               doing him wrong. If I had served him as I ought to have done, he would
               have allowed me to serve him all my life; but because I provoked him and
               neglected the service of his bondmen, for this reason he cast me down.</quote>
            And so, though he was already a dead man in the body, men supporting
            him and setting him up, he insisted on their coming up before him and on
            stretching out his hand, weeping, and dipping it in the water in which the
            strangers had been washed, and taking it and smearing it on his body.
         </p>
         <p>
            A short time before a persecution had been set on foot by those who served
            the synod of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName>', and men who possessed the name only of churchmen
            <pb n="96"/><pb n="96"/>expelled many by the use of barbarian troops, and many they arrested and
            imprisoned, and many they drove to death by stripes inflicted with rods, and
            many again they greedily and mercilessly plundered; and others they reduced
            to submission by force, and, when men had eaten and drunk wine and meat,
            they would open their mouths with lashing<note></note> hides (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σκύτος</foreign>) and rods, and stuff
            their oblation into their mouths. When these things were being done in the
            very village in which these blessed men lived (inasmuch as it was in fact
            inhabited by real churchmen), at first they went straight to the blessed
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> the old man's disciple; for of the saint himself they were afraid; for
            indeed some time before also they had used blandishments with him under the
            cloak of persuasion and affection, and they saw the vigour of his disposition,
            when they on their part thought that they were deceiving him as a simple
            man; for he on his side went on openly anathematizing them. Therefore they
            shrank from him; and for this reason they bent the whole mass of their plans
            in the direction of his disciple. And, when they went and began to speak
            craftily to him with coaxing words, while they praised the head of their
            congregation, that is their <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishop</persName>', and wished to deceive and say, <quote>There
               <pb n="97"/><pb n="97"/>is nothing wrong, but agree and accept</quote>, while they on their side said these
            things to him softly and gently, as is said in the psalmist, <quote>Their words are
               softer than oil, and they are arrow-points</quote>', inasmuch as he was vigorous
            in his speech and in his zeal, he cried from his own window to them, <quote>Stand
               up and go away from here, evil wicked men. You are cursed with the
               deceitful doctrine that you proclaim, since you advise me to accept a
               quaternity instead of the Holy Trinity, in which I was sealed for my life's
               salvation</quote>. But these men, when they heard the anathema upon them
            spoken boldly? without fear, on their part also began their own methods,
            saying to him, <quote>Come, come out; since there is no possibility of your staying
               here</quote>. But the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> said to them: <quote>I will not come out
                  of myself. But, if you turn me out, as our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> lives, <quote>whose I am
                     and whom I serve</quote>', in the middle of the church, while the whole city is
                  assembled, before them and in the middle of them I will go up to the chancel
                  (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βήμα</foreign>), and will curse you to your faces, you and the head of your congregation</quote>.
            And his speech was thus keen and cutting, like a sword. But
            these men were yet more agitated by his words, and they pulled down his
            <pb n="98"/><pb n="98"/>window, and dragged him out. But the blessed man did not neglect to carry
            out his oaths upon them; but the same night he set out and went to the holy
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> the stylite; because this happened in his days, while he was still alive,
            even as he also contended for twenty years in this struggle (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) against the
            heretics<note></note>; but the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishops</persName>” were much ashamed before him and feared to
            send, or anyone to presumes to enter his monastery; unless perhaps one of
            the clergy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κλήρος</foreign>) came in to him as it were by chance, who had voluntarily
            numbered himself in the ranks of the heretics, and being ashamed acknowledged 
            the falsity of their<note></note> faith. And thus two <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishops</persName> passed away and
            died one after the other, and none molested the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName>“. But the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">third</persName>third,
            in order to gratify those who appointed him, was lifted up in his pride and
            presumed to go to the blessed man, advising and admonishing and cajoling
            him, in order to bring him into subjection to the evil impiety of the accursed
            synod of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName>. And, because this was a great and celebrated man,
            this man craftily sought means to catch him if only in speech, in order by himb
            to deceive many, and say <quote>Lo! <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> of his column agrees with us</quote>; and,
            <pb n="99"/><pb n="99"/>if this had really happened, numberless persons would indeed have been
            deceived and brought to this<note></note>. But the blessed man, as one that was a
            valiant man and wise in God, did not yield to his blandishments, nor yet
            fear his threats; but as a valiant man he in everything showed him to be a
            denier of God and a deceiver, with all of his opinion, and that instead of the
            Holy Trinity, which was delineated in the prophets and proclaimed in the
            holy church in the apostles, those men were secretly introducing a quaternity,
            diluting their blasphemies like a drug with honey to give them to the
            people of the believers to drink. And so he was dismissed from his presence,
            humbled in his pride and with his plans frustrated, since he had not effected
            his intention, and even recoilingº from his presumption, as he also soon
            received a castigation on this account and a humiliation of his pride, which
            we decline even to describe because of its fearful nature and the greatness
            of the subject. When therefore the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> came to the very same
            holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName>, and he was startled at his coming and shed bitter tears, on
            account of the distresses of the believers and the cruelty of the renegades,
            and the ejection of the saints from their places of close seclusion chosen for
            God's sake, he said to him, <quote>What is it, my son? what has happened that
               <pb n="100"/><pb n="100"/>you have come out of your seclusion? Why have you come hither? And
               what has befallen our holy father your master? Has even he also come out?</quote>
            Then the zealous <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName>, himself also weeping, related to him everything
            that had been done, and that they had been afraid of his master, and had not
            gone to him; and that he himself moreover had bound himself by oaths to go
            and go in and curse them before the whole city inside the church if they
            turned him out. When we all too being assembled heard these things also,
            we too desired to learn about the ejection of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> the recluse; but our
            father continued beating on his breast and weeping with sobs, saying, <quote>Alas
               for my latter end and for my evil days, to what times I have been preserved.
               It is in thy power, Lord, to take my soul from me, rather than that I should
               see the buffetings and the distress of thy believers, and the persecution of thy
               church which thou purchasedst with thy precious blood'. Have mercy, Lord,
               and remember thy church which thou purchasedst with thy passion and
               savedst with thy cross. <quote>Behold from heaven</quote>, my Lord, <quote>and see; and
                  visit this vine, and the vine which thy right hand planted</quote>?</quote> While our
            holy father was saying these things with feeling and with bitter sobs, at the
            sound of his pitiful sobs we all wept with him. But, when he had been
            <pb n="101"/><pb n="101"/>silent for a little time and longer (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μάλλον</foreign>), he gave orders that the blessed
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> should retire to rest, inasmuch as he was weary from the effort of
            the walk. After a day and two days had passed, he was desirous of carrying
            out his oaths and hurling anathemas at them, the men who were persecuting
            God's holy church. And, when the blessed man tried to restrain him and
            said, <quote>My son, you are throwing yourself into a struggle (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>), and you
               are about to fall into the hand of cruel and merciless men, and you have a
               trial to endure. Beware</quote>, the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> said to him: <quote>Our father,
                  pray for me for our Lord's sake; because I for my part am prepared for
                  suffering, and I will contend until death with the renegades who malign
                  God, and fire will not frighten me, nor sword, nor scourgings, nor rakes'.
                  But only pray for me</quote>. But the blessed man, when he saw his firmness and
            readiness, blessed bim and sent him away, saying, <quote>Our Lord strengthen
               you, my son. Go in peace</quote>. But the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> set out and reached
            the city on the holy first day of the week at daybreak. Then he went straight
            to the church; and, while the whole city were sitting after the morning
            lauds, among them he also who enjoyed the name of the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishopric</persName><note></note>, and
            <pb n="102"/><pb n="102"/>listening to the preacher (because those who were orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>) also
            used to be present in the congregation during the hearing of the service and
            the lessons and the preacher, only without communicating), then suddenly
            there was seen at the door of the church a strange and outlandish sight; and
            everyone was startled when they saw a form (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) that was not their own,
            an anchorite coming in, clad in a patchwork of rags made of sackcloth, and
            carrying his cross on his shoulder, (and he came straight in without asking
            a question straight to the middle of the church, without speaking or turning
            this way and that), and, while the preacher was standing and speaking,
            he paused, while everyone was struck with astonishment, and they looked
            to see what the matter was. But the blessed man, as soon he reached the
            chancel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βήμα</foreign>), planted his cross on the step and made to mount. And, when
            he had begun to mount one and two steps in silence, and everyone supposed
            that he was going to say something either to the city or to the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishop</persName> or to
            make a request of them, he on reaching the third step, where the preacher
            was standing, flung out his hand and seized him by the neck and grasped
            him tightly, and said to him: <quote>Evil wicked man, our Lord commands <quote>Give
               not that which is sacred to the dogs, nor pearls' before the swine</quote>?, 
               wherefore are you speaking the words of God before men who deny him?</quote> And
            <pb n="103"/><pb n="103"/>he swung his hand round and gave him a buffet, and distorted his mouth;
            and he seized him and shook him down. And he himself sprang up and
            stood in his place at the top of the chancel-steps (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βήμα</foreign>), and said: <quote>Cursed
               are the renegades; cursed are the persecutors; cursed is the synod of
               <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName>, and whosoever assents to it. Cursed is every soul that receives
               the oblation from you and assents to your opinion unless he repents</quote>.
            When the blessed man had cried these words in a loud voice, great turmoil
            and confusion prevailed among the clergy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κλήρος</foreign>) and the people and the
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishop</persName>, some threatening, some expressing indignation, some crying, <quote>This
               man is a teacher of error, let him be arrested</quote>, and some crying, <quote>Let no
                  man lay hands upon him and die</quote>. And so the whole city became one
            intense volume of sound, the adversaries expressing indignation, and the
            believers joy. Since they feared on account of the people to lay their hands
            upon the blessed man, the man who was practised in pernicious wiles rose and
            quieted the people by saying, <quote>Be so good' as to let the blessed man come
               into the vestry?, and we will speak, and see what his business is</quote>; and thus
            he succeeded by a trick in withdrawing him from the people, and then
            accomplishing his will upon him. When the crowd (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όκλος</foreign>) had dispersed,
            <pb n="104"/><pb n="104"/>then like ravening beasts who find a sheep in a field and all attack it, each
            of them tearing his own portion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέρος</foreign>) from it, so they all savagely attacked
            the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName> from all sides, so that even his body could not supply
            each of them with a place where he could exercise his cruel disposition and
            cause pain by striking him. At last, when they had vented all the venom
            of their malice upon him, they went on to shave off the hair that marked his
            ascetic profession<note></note> (since he as well as the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2095">Simeon</persName> his master wore
            the honoured habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of the anchoritic life), and put irons upon him, and
            assigned men to him, and sent him to a certain house of anchorites in
            <placeName>Armenia</placeName> that is called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2867">ʿTryz</placeName>, and it would be better for a Christian to be
            confined in the lowest dungeon in a prison than in that <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2867">monastery</placeName>; for anyone
            who was sent thither was thenceforth reduced to utter despair, on account
            of the boundless severity of sufferings which they used to inflict on the man
            who was sent to them; since they were very zealous for the tenets of the
            heresy, and they used to reckon it as an act of justice to torture believers;
            and accordingly they would stand over them like executioners not one or two
            <pb n="105"/><pb n="105"/>or a hundred only, but each one of them would pull him<note></note> from his side and
            torture him (for they were about three hundred); and accordingly those
            who used to send to that place were confident that their purpose would be
            accomplished. But the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3154">Sergius</persName>, being confined in the middle of the
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2867">monastery</placeName> on the third floor, by God's help escaped from them on the third
            day, having even slipped out of his irons, and a certain pitcher for water,
            which was the only thing that he had with him, he also in the keenness of his
            ardour grasped in his hand, and he climbed up to his window on the third
            floor, and he leaped with that pitcher also in his hand and the irons with
            it?, and he came down and stood on his feet outside the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2867">monastery</placeName>. And
            so he escaped from them, and came to his holy master; and he fell upon
            his face before him, and said: <quote>Now, sir, I have learned that God loves
               you, and in truth hears you; since, unless the mediation of your prayers helps,
               it would have been quite impossible for me to see your face</quote>.
            When he had related everything to him, he gave thanks to the merciful God, who cares
            for his own. But afterwards he asked his master's permission to go and
            build a <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> in a certain mountainous district belonging to a village
            <pb n="106"/><pb n="106"/>called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">Qlwfyte</placeName>; and he gave him permission and blessed him. And he
            took his cross and the saint's blessing, and went and erected his cross there,
            and recites the service. And he kneels down and prays for three days,
            night and day; and then some people saw him and gave information in the
            village, and they came to him. And on his informing them of his purpose
            they were pleased; and each one of them ran to his house to find something
            to bestow upon the blessed man's prayer in proportion to his ability, while
            by the common effort also a <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> was erected in that desolate
            mountainous region in a few days, there being abundance of water there.
            When the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> was completely finished, the adversaries heard the
            news, <quote>That audacious stubborn man is building a <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> in such-and-such 
               a place</quote>; and men were at once appointed to go out and pull the
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> down to its foundations, <quote>and signify to him also besides that you
               desire to arrest and bring him to us'; and if you see that he is ready and
               willing to come, leave him alone, and do not bring him upon us</quote>. Then
            these men set out, having first declared and professed <quote>Why! perhaps he
               will be afraid, and run away from us</quote>. And, when they came, they found
            the blessed man standing and reciting the service; and, when they saw him,
            they said to him: <quote>Since you have built a <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> without an order, we
               <pb n="107"/><pb n="107"/>have been ordered to pull your <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> down, and conduct you to the
               <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishop</persName></quote>. But the blessed man in the fervour of his zeal said to them with
            oaths: <quote>If you are in truth ordered to pull down and desire to do so, I myself
               will lay the first ax to it; and, if it is your desire, I will go in before you
               to him who sent you</quote>. When those men saw that he was ready, they were
            afraid of him; and they say to him: <quote>We are truly ordered to pull it down
               and are prepared to do so; but we do not desire you to come in to the
               <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3688">bishop</persName></quote>. Then the blessed man was the first to run and take his ax,
            and he fixed it in the wall and said to them: <quote>Come, here is glory to our
               Lord</quote>. And they, because they were many, pulled the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> down
            to the ground in one day; and he himself was assisting them to do the work
            of demolition. But, when they had finished their task, and he was himself
            urging them to drag away the wood and stones and throw them outside, he
            said to them: <quote>Listen now, evil wicked men. In truth I say to you that, if
               renegades against grace deserved it, I would thank you greatly for labouring
               with me here. God without your being aware of what you have done
               constrained you to subvert these huts, as to which I was truly exercised in
               my mind in consequence of the fact that they were built in haste; and now I
               trust in our Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> that I shall now build a <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> indeed here</quote>.
            <pb n="108"/><pb n="108"/>They say to him: <quote>If you rebuild, we will pull it down again</quote>. He on his
            side says to them: <quote>Take what I say to you. By him who built the house
               of all this world and was called the carpenter's son, if so be you pull it down
               as many as thirty times, I will make it more spacious and I will make it
               stronger than before all my life, if you pull it down</quote>. Then they departed
            thence, wondering at the fervour and the vigour of the man. But the blessed
            man dug and delved deep and laid the foundations on a spacious basis; and
            he built a substantial <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2837">monastery</placeName> and made it strong; and he planted a
            plantation, and made an enclosure round, and made a very desirable place<note></note>.
            And, after a short time, he went to be blessed by the holy old man his master;
            and the summons followed him, and he ended his life with him there, bearing
            good testimony; and he was laid out” and buried by his spiritual father, who
            was still in good health. But the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2095">Simeon</persName> after living brilliantly in his
            seclusion forty-seven years<note></note> ended his days, and himself also fell asleep in
            peace; by whose prayers, with those of all the saints his companions, may all
            wretched men gain merey in the day of judgment.

         <p>
            The tale of the healings and deeds of power and cures that God wrought
            <pb n="109"/><pb n="109"/>for his glory by the hand of this holy old man the time is too short for me
            to relate; and for this reason, wishing to avoid a lengthy narrative, I have
            recorded these things only, thereby falling far short of the splendid glories
            of this man; to which it is not only I who was a witness, but all who knew
            him; so that another great and holy man and seer of spiritual visions also
            who lived in the south in the inner desert bore testimony about the old
            man, since, when some men from the territory (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρα</foreign>) of the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2737">Amida</placeName>
            were going down for the harvest (because men are in the habit of going
            down to the southern country for the harvest), they heard of that saint, and
            were eager to go and be blessed by him; and, when they had gone and had
            come to him and been blessed by him, he asked them, <quote>Whence are you,
               my sons?</quote>; and they said, <quote>From the north of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2737">Amida</placeName></quote>. The blessed man
            said to them: <quote>But what, my sons, do I for my part really know? and
               wherefore did you come to my wretched self? If you are from the north
               of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2737">Amida</placeName>, wherefore did you not go to the pillar of light which stands in
               the northern country, who to-day has been serving God in his saints for
               forty years, and has not grown tired or weary, nor is yet satiated with so
               <pb n="110"/><pb n="110"/>doing? Wherefore, my sons, did you not go to this man, who has refreshed
               God in the persons of the weary, who has also caused the savour of his
               practices and of his purpose that is good and acceptable' at all times
               to reach to the heavens of heavens?</quote> But these men on hearing these
            things from the saint fell on their faces and continued entreating him and
            saying: <quote>Who, sir, is he of whom you have said these things to us?</quote>
            But the blessed man, in accordance with what our Lord also taught in his
            preaching, <quote>A city built upon a mountain cannot be lid</quote>, and again <quote>So
               let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and
               glorify your Father that is in the heavens</quote>?, says to these men: <quote>This
                  is <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2095">Simeon</persName> the recluse who is living in seclusion on the top of a hill in the
                  village of <placeName>Kalesh</placeName>. But go to him, and greet him from me and say to him,
                  <quote>An idle sinful man settled in the desert entreats you, <quote>As I know you
                     to be always fervent in your love towards God, perform an act of love, and
                     pray for me</quote></quote></quote> But these men, as the blessed man enjoined them,
            came and informed the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2095">Simeon</persName> of these things; and they said to
            him as he said to them, seven years before his departure from the body,

            thanks to God.
