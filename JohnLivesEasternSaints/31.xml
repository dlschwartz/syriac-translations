         <head>Next the Thirty-First History, of Two Brothers Who Were Traders, Who
            Beside Worldly Trade Engaged Moreover in Divine Also, Whose names
            are <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1705">Elijah</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3140">Theodore</persName>.</head>
         <p>
            Since therefore it is our purpose to tell the stories of men who walked in
            the path of religion, and in the course of our history to make the glories of
            their practices known, accordingly neither have we kept the glories of these
            excellent men hidden, who in their garb (<foreign>σχήμα</foreign>) were reckoned laymen and
            traders, but were constantly occupied in the practices of angels. These are
            two brothers, and in the time of their boyhood they served for pay with
            traders, and travelled with them, each of them in his own direction, that is,
            to the regions of the <persName>Persians</persName> both of them. And they formed in their mind
            <pb n="577"/><pb n="375"/>the purpose of following a religious life; and they determined that whatever
            God provided for them should go to their own use, and that of everyone else
            whom they saw to be a stranger like them and in need. And thus they
            thenceforth did; for they carried on their business, and distributed to the
            poor and to the strangers. And, when God saw their zeal, he caused everything 
            to which they put their hand to increase abundantly in their hands.
            And thus a blessing rested on everything that passed through their hands,
            they having resolved to abstain entirely from the evil practices which traders.
            of the world are wont to follow, i.e. from oaths of all kinds, and from lying,
            and from extortion, and from diverse weights and diverse measures<note></note>. They
            told everything to the man who was buying from them or selling to them
            fairly and honestly without contention; but, if that man whoever he might
            be began oaths and bargaining, they on their side would say to him shortly
            as follows: <quote>Brother, accept what I have told you honestly, without extortion
               and without fraud and contention, and without bargaining and oaths. If it
               suits you buy (or sell). Wherefore are you making havoc of (?) oaths
               and allowing Satan to thrust you into sin, when you are under no necessity
               <pb n="578"/><pb n="376"/>to buy (or sell) whether you want or not? Now, if it suits you, take
               it without oaths; and if not, pray for us</quote>.<!-- Brooks' use of quotations here is really confusing. -->
         </p>
         <p>
            And thus these excellent men followed their employment in the fear of God,
            each of them serving for two and three years at the salary of five or six
            <foreign>denarii</foreign>. And, when those under whom they were employed saw that God
            caused everything that they did to prosper in their hands, they appointed
            them ten <foreign>denarii</foreign>; and again, after some years during which they had been
            willing to travel, they appointed them twenty <foreign>denarii</foreign> a year; and at last,
            when they saw the blessing that grace brought about through them, they
            appointed them thirty <foreign>denarii</foreign> a year, that they might remain with them only,
            having committed to their hands all that was in their houses; and they had
            very large storehouses (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άποθήκη</foreign>), and they used to do business in many regions.
            But these excellent brothers, when they had completed twenty years at this
            salary, and Grace fed them out of their honest labour, deliberated with one
            another, saying, <quote>It is better for us for the future to go and carry on business
               ourselves on our own account out of that which Grace has provided for us;
               that it may in be our power and choice to give to God out of that which he
               gives us without fear of others.</quote> And so after twenty years they returned to
            <pb n="579"/><pb n="377"/>their country i. e. to <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName>. Now they had two sisters who also had been
            engaged in practices of asceticism and sanctity in virgin fashion from their
            childhood, and at all times constantly devoted themselves to sorrow and tears
            and petitions and prayers, and that while they were mourning over these same
            brothers during so long a time in which they had not seen them, but had
            only heard from time to time that they were alive and in the land of the
            <persName>Persians</persName>; and when they came they did not recognise them on account of the
            lapse of time, until they themselves informed them. And they determined to
            make a gain of their sisters' spiritual blessing also all the days of their
            life; and so they removed and went and settled the four of them together at
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/136">Melitene</placeName> a city of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>, and there they thenceforth began to labour
            in spiritual fashion at their business, and all the income that they received
            they used to divide equally between themselves and the strangers and poor.
            And from the time when they began, because God also was pleased with them,
            they both received the gratitude and the blessings of the poor and needy every
            day, and further the business carried on without deceit and extortion and lying
            ascended like the vapour of incense at all times from the devout men themselves 
            to him who knows all, and so according to the riches of his mercy he
            <pb n="580"/><pb n="378"/>who has not deserted and does not desert any who trust in him showed his
            favour openly, and his blessing rested on all that they did. And thus in a
            short time they attained to great wealth, while even they themselves marvelled
            and wondered how it was that, while they were always scattering it, it increased 
            with them. And thenceforth the fame of their kindness and of their
            almsgiving went out everywhere, and needy persons from all quarters used to
            come to them, and supply their needs from them for each man according to
            his due; and moreover the visitation of the persecuted whom they heard to be
            in need everywhere they would console through their gifts. And accordingly 
            they disregarded the worldly trade, and strenuously and earnestly
            followed the spiritual one with great watchfulness, insomuch that they would
            press the same upon their blessed sisters with regard to the trade carried
            on through the gifts derived from their labour, that they also might add this
            to the rest of their practices. And thus each would on his part give as he
            was able, and still it increased the more, so that in that place was manifestly
            fulfilled that which was said in the prophet, <quote>I will pour blessings upon you
               till ye shall say <quote>Enough</quote></quote><note></note>. Thus therefore it happened to these men from
            <pb n="581"/><pb n="379"/>God, insomuch that they were unequal to the task of bringing forth and
            giving, while their house was turned into a hospice (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενοδοχείον</foreign>) for strangers
            and other persons in need And accordingly there were a multitude (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όχλος</foreign>)
            of many persons in that house, of slaves and hired men and bondmaids, and
            travellers besides and strangers who were gathered together for God's sake,
            and girls also, and old women, and blind and maimed men, insomuch that
            they practised the ordinances of monasticism in all the departments of their
            house, fasting and abstinence and asceticism; and they had weeks<note></note> as in a
            monastery and did menial work, and separate cells for prayers and for secret
            labours by night, since each of them used to watch and pray. And accordingly 
            all the night there was heard from their cells spiritual singing and
            the reading of the Scriptures; and so in the morning also as well, until each
            one's repetition of the service was finished, he would not consent to go out
            at all and make an answer (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπόχρισις</foreign>) to anyone's call. But the elder whose
            name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1705">Elijah</persName> they would urge, for the sake of the security (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άσφάλεια</foreign>)<note></note> of the
            house, to take a wife; and he yielded to the pressure, and he alone took a
            wife, while with him also the Scripture-saying was fulfilled which says, <quote>A
               <pb n="582"/><pb n="380"/>good woman shall be given to a man who feareth the Lord</quote><note></note>. For this
            woman, when she came in and saw that they were bent on running in the
            path of righteousness, began and quickened the running, and passed them all,
            in sorrow and tears and fasting and watching and prayers, while she also
            learned the psalms by heart; and she was further prepared to go out to
            a monastery or to the desert. And she had sons born to her beside one
            daughter; and she at once made her a nun. And so all these excellent
            persons ran after spiritual things. But, if it happened that cases of
            necessity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκας</foreign>) arose for them to make an answer (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπόχρισις</foreign>) to a call
            during the night, one of them would be chosen and appointed the evening
            before to perform that office, while he would make entreaty and request all
            the others to entreat the Lord for him <quote>because I am neglecting the praise of
               God, for the sake of which he gave me a mouth and a tongue². Pray for me
               that God may preserve me, lest a stain of sin be secretly formed' in me
               through the things that I am doing</quote>; and thus he would carry out that office;
            so that on account of the fame of their excellent mode of life, when occasions
            called us to the royal city, we used to make our lodging with them, and it
            might happen that we even passed several days in their house both on the
            <pb n="583"/><pb n="381"/>way up and on the way back, since they had now made a martyrs' chapel in
            one of the chambers of their dwelling, and at the hour of their own assembly
            for service they used to meet there, and anyone who was known and
            honoured by them they would receive there. Accordingly, when we
            looked at these persons who were called by the name of laymen, and at
            their regulations and customs (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>), how great and small down to little
            children and hired servants and slaves male and female passed their time
            in devout practices and rendering of praise and thanks to God, and in
            fasting and prayers at all times, we inwardly despised ourselves, crying woe
            upon our life, since the Christian name only without deeds was called over us,
            while we also remembered with sorrow the words of our Lord who says, <quote>The
               tax-gatherers and the harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you</quote><note></note>.
            And so we marvelled at these things while we were with them; and we were
            especially astonished at the greatness of their kindness and the direction of
            their will toward God, so that, whenever they saw us great and small, they
            would thus with as little intermission as possible refuse to leave us, but,
            thinking of us that we were in truth actually Christians, each of them would
            <pb n="584"/><pb n="382"/>ask to hear from us about his thoughts and about the other modes of life, and
            <quote>How must I deal with such-and-such a thought?</quote> and <quote>What labour will
               bring me near to God?</quote>, each of them separately according to his station,
            whether women or men<note></note>. And we like what our Lord said also to the scribes
            and Pharisees, <quote>Ye bind heavy burdens upon men's necks, but ye yourselves
               do not touch them not even with one of your fingers</quote><note></note>, similarly would urge
            them to things to which we were ourselves strangers by describing a model
            of righteousness and by stories of the fathers. And they all vied with one
            another the more in the ardour with which they carried out their observances.
            But, inasmuch as the profit of the spiritual trade in those who flocked to
            them every day was not enough for them, they resolved that one of these
            excellent brothers should take what God had provided for them, and go out
            to the districts in which the persecuted and ill-used convents were dwelling,
            and distribute his bodily things among them, and himself make spiritual
            gain through their prayers; since the time had in fact come when the
            believers were persecuted and maltreated in every district. And so he
            would go out and go round the whole of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</placeName>, and as far as <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/place/716">ʿArab</rs><note></note> and
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/109">Callinicus</placeName> and the desert, accompanied by two bondmen, and he did so in
            <pb n="585"/><pb n="383"/>the dress (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of a secular trader without being known, and he was
            making spiritual gains. And so by the love of God which they showed in
            their trade these admirable men would every day send great loads to heaven,
            and completed the days of their life in practices which it surpasses even
            the power of words to describe, in love of the new life of the kingdom of
            heaven, while we have not been competent to describe any part of the
            greatness of their glory. But at last they even sold all that they had
            also, their mansions and the rest of the worldly goods that they possessed,
            and distributed it among the poor and the monks; and so they all became
            monks. The blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1705">Elijah</persName> had departed from the world before taking the
            habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>); but his wife and daughter ended their lives in a women's
            monastery in the territory of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2812">Mabbug</placeName><note></note>; and their sisters are even down to
            the present time also, which is the year eight hundred and seventy-eight<note></note>,
            living in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2758" >Anzetene</placeName><note></note> <placeName>the country of the Urtaye</placeName><note></note>, and they preside over a
            monastery in the village of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2827">N'ns</placeName>, and they are in extreme old age, and
            occupied in labours of perfection.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of two brothers <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1705">Elijah</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3140">Theodore</persName> the traders is ended.
