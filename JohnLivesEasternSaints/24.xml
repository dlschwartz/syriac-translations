         <head>Next the Twenty-Fourth History, of the Blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">John</persName> Bishop of the City of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/200">Thella</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n311-1"/></head>
         <p>
            When therefore we approach the history of this holy bishop <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">John</persName> that
            abounds in beauties, we need the help that is brought through his prayers,
            and then we shall be able, even if obscurely, through the vile pigments of
            our words, to lay down and trace out a delineation of the features of his
            divine beauties<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n311-2"/>; and indeed his beauty does not shine from one side only,
            but from all sides the rays of his light flash upon the soul that wishes to
            gaze at him; for, if in accordance with the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName>'s saying<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n311-3"/> one seek him
            among solitaries, he is a perlect solitary, and, if among priests, a high-priest,
            and, if among persecuted men, one who bears his cross on his shoulder every
            day, and, if among the public contests of combatants (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγωνιστής</foreign>), a brave
            combatant (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγωνιστής</foreign>) and a hero, and, if again in the series of martyrs, a true
            martyr for the truth of his faith; and this is the consummation of all his
            <pb n="514"/><pb n="312"/>beauties. This saint, for whom also, I think, the appellation 'God-clad’
            is not inappropriate, after the pattern of the ancient <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/544">Ignatius</persName>, the saint and
            bishop and martyr, who earned this name (and, if perhaps it is not audacious 
            to say it and to presume so far, this man seems to have shown yet
            even more valour than he in the contest on behalf of the whole church of
            the believers, that is, he distinguished himself to perfection in his acts),
            this man therefore at first distinguished himself in the laborious and divine
            practice of the solitary life; and by God's grace he was also advanced to be
            bishop of the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/200">Thella</placeName>. And, when again he had for some years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n312-1"/>
            led a severe life in this same city, the severe persecution set on foot by the
            partisans of the schismatic synod of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName> was wafted like smoke everywhere, 
            and it blinded everyone whose spiritual eyesight was not founded
            upon a sound basis, and concealed the light of their truth, and they became
            accomplishers of the saying, <quote>They changed God's truth into a lie</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n312-2"/>.
            When therefore this troublous time came to this blessed man, and sought<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n312-3"/>
            to unsettle him like many and turn him away from his steadfastness, he on
            his side was more resplendent and beautiful; and, having repelled the
            <pb n="515"/><pb n="313"/>heretical communion from him, he was driven from his see with all the
            other holy bishops, about twelve from his neighbourhood; and thenceforth
            they endured the severe labours and grievous hardships of banishment, and
            wanderings in every place. But this blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">John</persName> joyfully resorted to his
            former anchoritic habits, which he had previously desired to do; and often
            he wished to leave his see and depart, and he was hindered and stayed by
            the fear of judgment and requital for deserting the rational flock that had
            been entrusted to him; and now he found an opportunity, and returned to
            that for which he was ready, first to his <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/356">former convent</placeName>, which was in the
            city of <persName>Callinicus</persName>, which was called that of Mar <persName>Zakkhai</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n313-1"/>; and when he had
            been a short time in this convent, the adversary came thither also as well,
            and a second time the blessed man was again in banishment with his
            convent, with the rest of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2736">convents</placeName>, and with all the other bishops also;
            and thenceforth they were driven to the outer deserts, rejoicing and exulting 
            that they had been thought worthy to suffer persecution with Christ<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n313-2"/>,
            since the other bishops also were scattered over all the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2736">convents</placeName>.
            But, when the period of persecution had lasted about ten years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n313-3"/>, the rest of the
            <pb n="516"/><pb n="314"/>believers everywhere were in difficulties about ordinations (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>); and
            they began to have recourse to the believing bishops. But the blessed
            men, inasmuch as they were troubled by fear of lighting the furnace of
            persecution more hotly against them, refused to practise this<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n314-1"/> openly,
            though they did a few things in secret; and a murmuring on the part of those
            among the believers who had been banished from every quarter began to
            be stirred up against the blessed men, since they had been reduced to great
            difficulties, while they spoke and sent messages to them at all times, asking
            them to give a hand of ordination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>) to the church of the believers,
            <quote>because it is in great difficulties</quote>. Then all the bishops assembled together, 
            and considered what to do. If they should give the hand <quote>crowds of
               believers will come from every quarter, and the persecutors will hear it, and
               be more inflamed with rage</quote>; and on this ground they finally out of fear
            refused the thing. Then, as it is written that <quote>The Lord stirred up the
               spirit of <persName>Zurbabel</persName> and the spirit of <persName>Joshua</persName> the son of <persName>Jozadak</persName> the high-priest
               to stand up and build the Lord's house</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n314-2"/>, so also here it were fitting to say
            that the Lord stirred up the spirit of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">John</persName> to stand up and visit the Lord's
            <pb n="517"/><pb n="315"/>church, which is the persecuted in every quarter. Then he was moved
            with indignation in his spirit and argued against his fellow-bishops, saying:
            <quote>Lo! see that henceforth we are not perfect in the love of God, since
               according to the saying of Scripture, <quote>He who feareth is not perfect in
                  love</quote>; and again <quote>There is no fear in love</quote>; and again <quote>Love casteth out
                     fear</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n315-1"/>. And now we our own selves have stated it; and henceforth whither
               shall the persecuted and distressed believers who are with us go? Do you
               wish, pray, that we should send them to those that are every day killing
               them? for God knows that I for my part was ready for a life of quietude.
               by myself, and that I should leave God's people and church in distress and
               need, and serve my own self, far be it from me in the Lord's name. But
               now either consent to stretch out a hand to the believers in the boldness
               (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) of our God, and let us contend valiantly each of us doing his part,
               and, if not and you are afraid, give me a mandate and a licence from the
               patriarchs and from yourselves, and save yourselves; and I for my part will
               be persecuted, and I am ready even to die also a thousand times, if it were
               possible, for the sake of the believing people</quote>. The bishops rejoiced at
            this, and said: <quote>It is better that one of us only should be known by this in
               <pb n="518"/><pb n="316"/>the affair, and not all of us; and take also authority and licence from
               ourselves; and we will refer this by letter to our saintly father the
               patriarch<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n316-1"/>, and he will issue a mandate to us, that it shall be permitted to
               give a hand to all expelled men who come to you from all parts</quote>. And
            the blessed man clad himself in this zealousness, and thenceforth this became
            known to the expelled multitudes everywhere; and from that time they
            rushed in crowds to come to the blessed man freely without impediment like
            a flood that is produced in a river by thick clouds, while he was sometimes.
            to be found in his same monastery and received them there, and sometimes
            in the desert, and sometimes in some convent, receiving and dismissing
            companies of fifty and of a hundred in a day, and even now and again as
            many as two and three hundred a day, giving expositions and injunctions
            and caution and instruction, and performing the ordinations after careful
            investigation and many testimonies given, subjecting every man to a careful
            examination and test in reading the Scriptures and repeating the psalms,
            and ability to write their names and signatures, not admitting anyone
            whomsoever who did not sign his name, and, if anyone was incapable of
            doing so, he would bid him learn, and his companion would write for him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n316-2"/>,
            <pb n="519"/><pb n="317"/>and thus therefore they were received and dismissed; while he also inquired
            and learned who were the men of knowledge in all the districts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρας</foreign>), and
            he would send and fetch them, and give them instructions, and hand them
            the impress of his name and his monogram (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σημείον</foreign>), themselves to see by
            investigation who were fit to become priests, and to write and send them to
            him, that he might not perform ordinations at random. Accordingly in
            every city as far as the frontier, and as far as <placeName>Armenia</placeName> and <persName>Arzun</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n317-1"/>, and the
            land of the <persName>Cappadocians</persName> and the sea-coasts<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n317-2"/>, men were chosen and
            appointed to send candidates to him after investigation; and, if it happened
            that anyone came to him without a letter from the man that had been
            appointed in the region from which he came, he would return empty, until
            he brought a letter, and then he would be received; as no believing bishops
            were to be found except at these three places only, at Marde<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n317-3"/> and in the land of
            the <persName>Persians</persName>, and at <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/579">Alexandria</placeName>. When the whole earth, so to speak, had
            been filled with tlhe ordination (ysporovia) of believers, in the cities and the
            monasteries and the villages and everywhere, insomuch that some of those
            <pb n="520"/><pb n="318"/>that were in communion with the heretics would every day arrive and come
            to repentance, then these things exasperated those that held authority both in
            the churches and in the world, so that they did not shrink from writing a
            report of these things even to the wielder of the royal authority, first concerning 
            all the believers, and concerning all the freedom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) that they had
            shown, and then concerning him who had been made the cause of these
            things. Thenceforward they hunted after the blessed man's life to take it
            away<note></note>, while the occupiers of the sees at first sent him threats and orders
            and mandates issued by the king that, if he performed ordination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>),
            he should die; and he on his side sent them this message : <quote>I for my part
               have received a gift from God, and with it I am trading and am not negligent²;
               and know this, that, as long as I am in the bodily life, and a hand is given
               me to extend to anyone that is in need, not you nor an earthly king shall
               hinder me from performing the service that the heavenly king has given
               me</quote>” When they saw the man's readiness and courage, they threatened
            the more; and thenceforth he did not show himself openly with the former
            freedom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>), but at the time when believers arrived he on his side
            <pb n="521"/><pb n="319"/>would spring up there, and therefore he would dismiss many at night, as
            he was the first to admit our meanness also with the rest of our brothers,
            the members of our convent, to the order of the diaconate, in the year eight
            hundred and forty<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n319-1"/>, when we came down to him and received the privilege
            of seeing him by night, when we were also astonished above all things by his
            attire and the austerity of his garb, since an unsightly cloak had been cut
            in two, and so he clothed himself with half of it and covered himself with
            half of it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n319-2"/>, and thus therefore he had no superfluity either of clothing or of
            covering. When he saw our company and our habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>), and especially
            the fact that he had seen<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n319-3"/> that he had not much trouble with us, because
            all of us, who were about seventy men, came from well-known Amidene
            convents, and we read and wrote witlh confidence, then he said, <quote>I am
               satisfied with you, my sons; and lo! I say to you <quote>Pray and cease not</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n319-4"/>,
               for a time is coming when men to give a hand to believers shall be wanting
               and shall not be found</quote>. And so we received his blessing, and returned,
            and his prophecy also was in truth fulfilled, and they were sought and not
            <pb n="522"/><pb n="320"/>found, so that for many years a man would go into <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/579">Alexandria</placeName> to become
            a priest<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n320-1"/> and thence to <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/586">Constantinople</placeName>, and return perhaps after a year of
            days without gaining any satisfaction from his labour, as I saw happen to
            many; and at the time when I was in the royal city (and the same thing
            happened in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/579">Alexandria</placeName> also) the believers were in this difficulty; and the
            frontier of the Persian territory moreover was closed by war, and I always
            remembered the saint's prophecy. But after a time the blessed man fell
            into the enemies' hand<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n320-2"/>, and they satisfied all their malice upon him, and
            in their craftiness they also hanted for the documents (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χάρτης</foreign>) that contained
            the anathemas against them and the names of the believers who received
            the priesthood from him, and God hid them from them, the number of whom,
            as was posted up (?) by those who counted them, amounted to a hundred
            and seventy thousand, who received ordination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>) from the blessed
            man. But they on their side carried him up to <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>, and he fell into
            the hands of the man that one would perhaps not go wrong if one were to
            name the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2274">executioner</persName> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κυαιστιωνάριος</foreign>) of the believers, who was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2274">Ephraim</persName> of
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2737">Amida</placeName>; and he inflicted on him severe tortures<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n320-3"/> and close painful impri<pb n="523"/><pb n="321"/>sonments, 
            and thus he suffered martyrdom and died at their hands there,
            after a period of such-and-such a number of<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n321-1"/> years during which he had
            been undergoing the conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">àgών</foreign>) of martyrdom inflicted upon him there,
            and the successions of tortures and torturers that were imposed upon him in
            daily variety in the hope that he might be weakened in his constancy. And,
            inasmuch as he on his side was girded with the breastplate of righteousness.
            on the right hand and on the left as it is written, and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n321-2"/> held the strong
            weapon of readiness that contends with death, the burning, that is heretical,
            darts<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n321-3"/> of his persecutors were not able to pierce and penetrate the sound
            breastplate of his constancy, though many beasts were set round him on all
            sides to guard him, like that which the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/544">Ignatius</persName> also, the bishop and
            martyr, to whom at the beginning also we compared this second <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/544">Ignatius</persName>,
            as he is indeed exceedingly like, thus wrote in his epistle to the <persName>Ephesians</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n321-4"/>
            about certain soldiers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατιώται</foreign>.) to whom he was committed that they
            might conduct and convey him to <placeName>Rome</placeName> to be martyred there : <quote>Ten cruel
               savage beasts were committed<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n321-5"/> to me, between whom I was bound for my
               <pb n="524"/><pb n="322"/>custody that I might go to <placeName>Rome</placeName></quote>. So therefore in the same way there
            were committed<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n322-1"/> to this man not ten only, but rather many, so that no one
            whosoever among the believers was able to approach him, he being confined
            alone, and two<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n322-2"/> blessed men that were attached to him alone, who also were
            combatants (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγωνισταί</foreign>); and thus he ended his life in this conflict (<foreign xml:lang="grc">àgών</foreign>) in a
            great martyrdom. And thereupon after his martyrdom his words, of which
            he had also gained intimation by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, received
            accomplishment, for he would testify to every man and warn him concerning
            what was about to come, viz. violent persecutions, lacerations of the believers,
            scarcity of pastors, with the rest of the sore distresses, even as they were
            from all sides laid upon those of his ordination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>). Some, that is
            many, they seized in every city and re-ordained; and some fled to distant
            regions, and there ended their lives; some departed from life under imprisonments 
            and stripes; and some were burnt with fire in the sight of the
            peoples of the cities<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n322-3"/>. A thing which perhaps even the ancient pagans
            would have been afraid to do, Christians were here thrown into the fire and
            <pb n="525"/><pb n="323"/>burnt in the sight of those who also were reckoned and called Christians;
            and the steam of the savour of their flesh was woefully wafted to heaven and
            also into the air breathed by men; and so few were left <quote>like doves upon
               ledges</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n323-1"/> as it is written. And thenceforward the remnant of the orthodox
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξοι</foreign>), great multitudes who were in banishment or in places of exile
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορίας</foreign>), or those again who had hidden themselves in the cities and in the
            villages, or in villas, were in great sorrow and sore need, since for a space
            of so many years there was none to give them the communion of the lifegiving

            with his mercy to give a little refreshing to his church, though in
            distant regions, by means again of another <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">John</persName>, who also was in truth
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">John</persName>, of whom also we determined to compose a history separately<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n323-2"/>, that
            we may not protract the history to a great length; while we have also not
            sought to comprise any of the rest of the afflictions of this saint and of his
            conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">àgών</foreign>) and of his asceticism, and of his conduct moreover and of
            his abstinence in our history, inasmuch as it is endless, but we have rapidly
            run through these points, which are patent to him who knows all. By the
            <pb n="526"/><pb n="324"/>prayer of him who presents them<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n324-1"/> and of all saints like him, who present
            propiatory fruits to God, may he visit his church in mercy, and be gracious
            to us her children, who through our sins have made ourselves sons who
            provoke, and may they be expiated by the blood of the only God over all
            for ever and ever.
