         <head>Next the Sixth History, of the Great Man of God <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1980">Paul</persName>
            The Humble Anchorite,</head>
         <p>
            There was again a blessed man beloved of God and laborious and humble
            and a perfect Nazirite, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1980">Paul</persName> the anchorite, who was from the district of
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/493">Sophanene</placeName>. This man therefore, when he had been for many years practising 
            heavy and severe labours of asceticism and great abstinence, heard some
            men saying that there was a certain large cave in the side of a certain high
            rock on the banks of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/202">Tigris</placeName> at a place called Surtha', which is some
            distance from the cultivated land, but near the road, and malignant fiends
            lived in it, so that men passed along that road with trembling, though it<pb n="112"/>
            was very necessary that men should pass along it, because it led into the
            fortress called <placeName>Ziyat'</placeName>. But this blessed man, when he heard the report of
            that cave, reflected, <quote>Because those who pass along that road are frightened,
               and again in order that the powers of the enemy may be expelled by the
               name of human beings and the presence of a human habitation, it is a duty
               to go, and to erect the emblem of the cross there</quote>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Then this blessed man, like a mighty man who mocks at the feeble and
            sick men who wish to fight with him, confidently armed himself with the
            power of God and confidence in him, and directed his steps to the place.
            And he went and arrived at the cave, and near it at about half a furrow's
            length? he erected the cross; and he fetched stones, and traced the plan of a
            small oratory and knelt there in prayer, and passed the night in the place.
            And during the night shapes of basilisks and fearful shapes of every kind
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) gathered together against him?; and, the more constancy he on bis
            side showed, the more the gruff voices and grievous exhalations increased,
            just as if great serpents had arrived and were coming, and just as if their<pb n="113"/>
            breath were striking against the blessed man's clothes in order to drive him
            away. But he was thus constant in prayer all that night, and all the day,
            and again another night also. And next lo! a sound of boulders being uprooted 
            just above the blessed man, and they were indeed uprooted and came
            down from the rock above, and they came, and reached him, and thus they
            would pass by while he was kneeling at his prayer, not having power to
            touch him. And so he passed seven days and nights in that place in such
            conflicts. And, when these demons practised many different kinds of contrivances 
            against him in order to shake him or frighten him or drive him
            away, he like a mighty man girt in the true breastplate of his Lord was not
            shaken, nor reckoned their wiles and their foul shapes as anything, but also
            after he had, like a mighty man who trusts in his Lord, after the pattern of
            the holy <persName>David</persName>, chosen for himself the sound pebbles of prayers from the
            river of grace, and had taken the staff of the cross, and lifted the sling of
            heavenly trust, then he next looked upon the camp of the <persName>Philistine tyrants</persName>,
            to pull down their prowess and to scatter their camp. And so on the eighth
            day he planted his cross in the midst of that cave, and, hung up a bag of
            saints' at the east end of it, and knelt in it to pray a prayer. And,
            while he was kneeling, frequent sounds of loud and violent howling were
            suddenly heard in the cave itself, such that many thousands of men if
            they joined together would not be able to howl so loud, so much so that
            the blessed man used to say, <quote>If help from God had not reached me, I
               should have gone out of my mind; so that I was indeed already dazed,
               and my head became dizzy, and my ears rang from the violence of
               that sound. And thus I remained constant in trust on God; and at last I
               heard a voice outside the door, saying, <quote>Alack! the cross has laid us
                  low; otherwise you with the dirty hood would not have laughed at us;
                  and it is not you who would have ejected us from our place, and come in
                  and settled in it yourself.</quote> Then, when I saw that they had gone outside
               the mouth of the cave and were crying to me from outside, I rejoiced;
               and I also was strengthened, and I said to them: <quote>I also am contending
                  with you and expelling you by the cross itself, not by my own strength</quote>.
               And from that time I remained settled in the cave, while they used to 
               display before me foul visions and many fearful shapes strange to the sight<pb n="115"/>
               of men, and thereupon they would hold speech with me as men, and further
               they would even take the shapes of men, and would come and pretend to
               entreat me to come out and go with them to their houses, for the purpose 
               (as they said) of visiting their sick. And again they would often come
               and cry <quote>Flee, flee. Lo! the land is full of <persName>Huns</persName></quote>. And <persName>Huns</persName> appeared
               to me in various fearful shapes, riding on horses and with swords drawn
               and flashing. And lo! they came up to the gate crying in barbaric language,
               and in an excited state, and with arrows fitted to their bows. And I on my
               part would say to them, <quote>This is my grave, and my place for ever. Until
                  the coming of <persName>Christ</persName> in his glory, and the resurrection from the abode of
                  the dead this is my place. I do not care; and, if you are in truth barbarians
                  and you have received power to kill, I do not fear death; and, if you are
                  fiends and can kill me or take me away and eject me from this place, lo! I am
                  before you; but my own will shall not be your assistant and eject me hence;
                  and not only in my life but not even in my death</quote>. While I was saying these
               words, all the hosts of the <persName>Huns</persName> would cry and go up upon these rocks thus:
               <quote>Henceforth the cross has protected this man against us. 
                  This man has con<pb n="116"/>quered</quote>.</quote>.
            These things the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1980">Paul</persName> used to repeat to me, because many
            times when I went to him I used to inquire of him, <quote>How, father, did you
               carry on the conflict with the strange powers who haunted this place and
               overcome them?</quote> But he, in order to expel and repress pride, would say to
            me: <quote>We, my son, should not have overcome nor should we be victorious,
               unless the cross had overcome. And, as we see, if we have understanding,
               that the hosts of Satan have been expelled and hurled down by the same
               cross not only from one small and insignificant place like this, but also
               from all quarters, in that it has deprived them of the worship paid to them,
               and caused their worshippers to turn to the cross, and closed their mouths,
               and whelmed them in the lowest abysses, so also from this place too these
               malignant spirits have been expelled by the power of the cross, and it has
               strengthened me for its glory</quote>. These few words he himself would repeat
            to me. But at last, when his fame had been spread about, many men used
            to resort to him, and he also gained about <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3657">ten disciples</persName> there, while even
            still the sights that were seen in the place were fearful, and, when men came
            to him, whether to reside or to stay for a time, he would arm them beforehand, 
            saying: <quote>If so be you see anything or hear any sound whatsoever,<pb n="117"/>
               be not agitated, but make the sign of the cross upon you and be silent;
               and, even if I myself call you or anyone else, do not come out</quote> (because
            the fiends often deceived men there). And again to those who came to him
            to receive instruction from him he would say the same words and he would
            caution them, since at night they slept inside, and he outside by the gate;
            because fiends used to appear in his likeness, and used to terrify the brother,
            and entice him out; because under the cave there was a great hole. And so
            the blessed man used to lie awake to guard the place in which he lived, from
            the time when he directed his steps to that cave, and he made an altar and
            set it up in it, and he made it a chapel. And thenceforth the brotherhood
            used to sleep confidently in it; and his monastery extended to twenty men.
            And so all the men of that district used to run to receive the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1980">Paul</persName>'s
            blessing, and to gain the privilege of seeing him, and to hear his gentle
            words;. for God gave also into his hand a great gift of healing. But his
            asceticism and his labours and his humility no man can succeed in describing'; 
            since he was so humble and retiring that, if a man were to sit with
            him and converse for three days, he would not raise his face (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) nor<pb n="118"/>
            would men see the inside of his eye, but he would thus converse with
            emotion with his head bent and his looks fixed downwards. When he had
            been in that cave for a space of about twenty-five years, and a monastery had
            been built, and the brotherhood had reached the number of thirty men, the
            blessed man finished his course', and departed from the body; and he was
            buried on the spot in accordance with his promise. And, on account of
            his love toward God and his humility, even after his death miracles were
            everywhere wrought through his holy bones, men taking his skull and
            going round the districts, and, wheresoever locusts came, or hail or a 
            scorching wind or bubonic plague, and his right hand or his head went, God
            would straightway make deliverance. By his prayers, with those of all the
            saints, may all we sinners have mercy in the day of judgment.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1980">Paul</persName> the blessed and holy anchorite is ended.
