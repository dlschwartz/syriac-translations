         <head>Next the Second History, Of the Divine Blessed Man <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName>.</head>
         <p>
            [...] and a spring broke forth and came out in abundance, many times more so than<pb n="19"/>
            that which existed before. And, when the blessed man saw it, he rejoiced
            and thanked God who had done his will; and at once the same night he
            departed to his master, having charged the brother who was with him not
            to reveal this to men during his life, as he also did not inform his master.
            But, when the news was received that the blessed man had gone down to
            the spring in the evening, in the morning many persons gathered together
            in order to go and be blessed by him; and they see the spring flowing in
            a copious and rich stream, and their lands and gardens inundated with
            water, and they ran to the city; and they informed the bishop of this. And
            the news was received throughout the city; and the bishop with the judge
            and the whole city directed their steps to the place; and when they saw it
            they marvelled and gave thanks, and praised God who does the will of them
            that fear him. And they called that fountain Mar <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName>'s spring' to this
            day; and it is even actually so called to the present time'. This was the
            first act of power which the prayer of this divine master produced in his own
            disciple.
         </p>
         <p>
            Again once the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3640">mighty hosts of the Huns</persName> came forth’, and those blessed
            men were in a fortress; and, when it was thought that they had passed by,<pb n="20"/>
            the blessed man sent him to go down and inspect the monastery. And, as
            he was going down, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3640">the host of the Huns</persName> came upon him on the way, while
            he was carrying his cross and walking, and repeating the service. And
            at once one of them ran and drew his sword, and raised his hand for the
            purpose of smiting the blessed man; and he on his side raised his hand
            against him and said to him : <quote>Ho! move it no farther</quote>. And the hand of
            that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3639">barbarian</persName> was impeded and moved no farther, while he retained his
            sword and his hand was thus raised, until the whole of the host had
            passed; and he was released and he also as well went away, while none of
            them had hurt him, and so, trusting in God, he also went to his monastery.
         </p>
         <p>
            After the term of years that the blessed man lived, when he had taken
            his rest and gone to (his) Lord, the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName>, wlio was in truth a small
            man (<persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">zʿura</persName>) in his stature and in his mind was higher than the high, made a
            column for himself, and went up and stood upon it, while thence forth the
            deeds of power and healings of his master were performed through him.
            For, [after] he had gone up on to the column, and it was accordingly no
            longer in his power to grasp paralysed persons with his hands and bend them
            and cure the sick, they used to give him water and he used to pronounce
            a blessing, and wherever it fell a cure was not long in following. But,
            when he had completed a term of years upon the column, the synodite<pb n="21"/>
            persecutors came to him; and, since they did not find in his disposition a
            chance of making him communicate with them, they brought him down
            from the column; and, when he had come down, he was moved with zeal
            saying, <quote>I will not rest till I go up to him who holds the royal authority,
               and testify to him before our Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> concerning the persecution
               of the whole church, and concerning the distresses and the mockery of the
               saints in every place</quote>.
         </p>
         <p>
            With this zeal the blessed man armed himself and with trust in his Lord
            also, and he arose and took <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3642">ten of his disciples</persName>, and journeyed to the royal
            city itself and arrived there, letters from the adversaries having also preceded
            the blessed man by no small number of days, which gave information as to
            his going up, by dispensation of providence, in the same manner in which
            things were also effected through <persName>Ahab</persName> without his knowledge, for, while
            he himself was turning over his plans for killing the zealous <persName>Elijah</persName> the great
            man, sending as of his own motion his envoys and his letters among foreign
            peoples with regard to his death, he was being made to celebrate and display
            the fact that he was able actually to bind the heaven so that no rain fell
            upon the earth, and was by his envoys proclaiming his mighty act to the<pb n="22"/>
            kings of the peoples', who, while they were unaware for what reason the
            heaven was prevented from discharging rain, were learning from the enemies
            themselves who was the cause of this, that he might become an object of
            astonishment. So therefore letters preceded this illustrious man stating
            concerning him, <quote>Lo! a disturber is coming there</quote>, and, <quote>If he enters
               the city, he will turn the whole of it upside down</quote>; which prophecy itself
            also they made after the manner of <persName>Caiaphas</persName>", as he did indeed in truth
            turn many from their evil faith to the truth.
         </p>
         <p>
            But, when the authorities received information of the blessed man's
            coming, they forthwith hastened to see him, in consequence of the alarming
            report about him, while even the king hastily enjoined precaution (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άσφαλεία</foreign>)
            upon his senators (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σύγκλητος</foreign>), and made a great assembly of bishops for the
            purpose of contending in argument with the blessed man himself, since the
            fear and terror of him had in consequence of the contents of the letters which
            were supposed to be adverse fallen upon the king and the chief men as well
            as the bishops, who thought that he had come up like the sea to smite
            them by means of his clever words, not knowing that simple men and fishermen 
            are not armed with these things, but with the hidden power of grace.<pb n="23"/>
            But, when the old man and all his company came in, and, the doctrines that
            were condemned had been gently' expressed, those that were right were
            again heroically expressed in sound language on behalf of the believers by
            the blessed man with the frankness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) of his Lord and the confidence
            that contends with death, while the spiritual old man carried out his procedure 
            according to what it is written that the king of <placeName>Edom</placeName> commanded
            and said, <quote>Ye shall not contend with great nor with small save with the
               king of <placeName>Israel</placeName></quote>?; for he did not direct his contest with great nor with small,
            but against him who roared as a lion, and looked whom he should devour",
            in that he sternly brought the whole measureless reproof against him personally, 
            on account of all the persecution of God's church, concerning all
            the blood that was shed in his days, concerning the introduction of this
            accursed synod, and concerning many things, saying, <quote>All these things God
               will require at your hands in the great day when he shall come, all the
               distress of the Christians everywhere</quote>. When the king by reason of the
            fear of him feared to lay a hand on the blessed man on account of the divine
            frankness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) which he possessed, he was excited by his rage, and<pb n="24"/>
            clenched his fist (?) as tightly as he could in violent rage, and struck himself
            upon the breast and said, <quote>You are apostates and corrupters, and the synod
               is true, and I will not consent to hear these things against it from you any
               more, and, if you were true men, God would show me a sign by your hands.
               And he who anathematizes the synod contends with his life</quote>. On all this
            commotion taking place great terror overwhelmed all the magnates; but the
            blessed man, when he saw that he had decreed death against anyone who
            anathematized the synod, was kindled with zeal and his heart became hot
            within him as it is written, and fire seized his body', and immediately he
            went straight against him, and said : <quote>The synod which divided <persName>Christ</persName> our
               Lord is anathematized not only by us, but also by the angels of heaven.
               And, since you seek a sign, by believers signs are not required; but the
               Lord will not show you a sign outside you, but in your own self</quote>. And so
            he’ went out in violent rage, while threats were also being forged against
            the blessed man. But after a day the sign for which he asked appeared in
            him according to the blessed man's saying, in that he was smitten upon his
            head, and his understanding was taken away; and a fearful swelling covered
            him', until human shape was not recognised in him', insomuch that his wife,<pb n="25"/>
            who was very cunning, hid him secretly in the chamber, that it might not
            be known to the city that he was already dead, and except two physicians
            and two chamberlains she did not allow anyone to come in to him, while
            she sent intercessors to the blessed man to ask him to come and for
            him that he might recover, and he would at once make peace in the church.
            And, this message having roused him, he went and saw him, and he was
            sorry; and he said to him : <quote>Lo! the sign which you sought</quote>. And the
            blessed man made a prayer, and the same hour his understanding returned
            to him, and he recognised the old man and knew that it it had so happened to
            him because he had set him at naught; and he went on entreating him to
            pray for him that he might be healed, and he might do all that he ordered;
            while the blessed man said to him : <quote>This happened to you, because you
               tempted the Lord your God like an unbeliever, and sought a sign</quote>. And
            thenceforth the dread of the blessed man fell upon him, and in fear he used
            to assent to his requests in everything; only the state of the church he did
            not set right, because the delinquencies of the <persName>Amorites</persName> were perhaps not
            yet full; but he ceased that violence and these threats, while the power of
            the old man's prayer thenceforward gave freedom of action (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>.) to all<pb n="26"/>
            the believers in every city and in every place, and they openly held assemblies, which' 
            before his coming the threat of death was decreed, against
            anyone who was discovered holding an assembly. And the fame of the
            blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName> reached as far as <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/641">Rome</placeName>, while God continued to work signs
            and deeds of power through him, and the whole city resorted to him, and
            he was made protector of the poor as in his country, while many great affairs
            were resolved by him before the king and all the senators (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συγκλητικοί</foreign>), while 
            every day he was engaged in the same contest on behalf of the faith. After
            the blessed man had been some time in the royal city, the man deserving
            of evil memory who had at that time been made patriarch in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/641">Rome</placeName>, whose
            name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3193">Agapetus</persName>, was summoned by some cause, and went down to the
            royal city“, a man who was a grievous blasphemer, in comparison of whose
            blasphemies those of the followers of <persName>Paul</persName> of <placeName>Samosata</placeName> were very small;
            who, if sentence from heaven had not overtaken him and suppressed his
            blasphemies, was about to issue this order, that the name of the Blessed
            <persName>Mary</persName> the God-bearer should not be commemorated in the church at all,<pb n="27"/>
            nor her likeness be found depicted anywhere, while he presumptuously
            promulgated his blasphemies, which did not retard for him the reward that
            his labour deserved. This man therefore, having been magnificently received
            by the king with much display, inasmuch as he was not aware of all the
            evil of his mind, when he had come in, inasmuch as he was annoyed by the
            reports of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName>, brought a complaint about him before the
            king, saying, <quote>Wherefore is the <persName>Syrian</persName> deceiver who is here allowed by you
               to turn the world to his deception'</quote>? But the king, inasmuch as he knew
            well the old man's power, said to him, <quote>And what can I do to him? For he
               is a stubborn man who does not fear men</quote>. But he, in order to show his
            zeal in the case of the blessed man first, accused him saying, <quote>Let me do to
               him so that he will submit, or be expelled from all the countries</quote>. And
            the king gave him his will, saying, <quote>If you are stronger than he, do as you
               wish</quote>.
         </p>
         <p>
            But this man in his arrogance without delay sent some of his own leading
            men and the king's to the blessed man himself (a large villa at <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2860">Sycae</placeName> on
            the other side? had been given him by the queen, and he was staying there<pb n="28"/>
            with all <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3642">his disciples</persName>; for it was the first days of the fast), while the 
            presumptuous man set himself against the blessed man by sending him a message
            in these terms : <quote>The king and the patriarch' have ordered that either you
               come here, or I come there at once; and it is quite impossible for you to
               remain longer in this country, unless you do the king's order and ours, and
               make accord with us</quote>. When the blessed old man heard these things, he
            jeered at his arrogance, telling them to say to him, <quote>We have a law (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>)
               laid down for us by our true King, that we are not to receive anyone in these
               holy days, nor make answers (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άπόκρισεις</foreign>); insomuch that our door is closed,
               and accordingly we are not free to answer either you or the king. But
               wait for us till the fifth day of the week when we shall open the door, and
               after we have opened it what God knows to be right he will himself perform
               between us. But for the present we will not voluntarily answer you; for if
               you seek to act with violence you know</quote>. When that wretched man
            learned these things, he was filled with violent rage, and ordered the
            magister to take excubitors and irons and bring the blessed man across.
         </p>
         <p>
            When that man as he was ordered had taken the irons and embarked in a<pb n="29"/>
            cutter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δρόμων</foreign>) with the military force and they had gone that he might
            fetch the blessed man, when he was on the point of landing on the other
            side, something like a wind took the cutter (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δρόμων</foreign>) and turned it back, and
            it was on the city side whence he had started. And again a second time
            they returned, and approached; and, when they were' just about' to fix the
            ladder (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχάλα</foreign>), it was as if a man grasped the boat (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καράβιον</foreign>), and with mighty
            force placed it where it started.
         </p>
         <p>
            Again according to that which is written <quote>They knew not nor understood
               that they were walking in darkness</quote>?, he was enraged against the cutter-men
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δρομωνάριος</foreign></foreign>) as if it was they who were lazy, and they proceeded to go on
            board. And, as they were struggling and advanced little nearer, like what
            is written again, <quote>The Lord was making war for <placeName>Israel</placeName></quote>, there came
            forth something like a flash of lightning and suddenly smote their boat
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καράβιον</foreign>), and the bench was torn out of it from end to end, and it sprang
            away and mounted upwards as far as the eye can see; and then that
            wretched man understood that it was God's power which was contending
            on behalf of the blessed man. And quickly with cries of lamentation they
            escaped to shore; and they went and told these things to those who sent
            them, and everyone was seized with wonder.<pb n="30"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            But, when that man had begun to promulgate his blasphemies openly,
            and poured his gall into the ears of the king and the people of the heretics
            who rejoiced that an instrument (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όργανον</foreign>) had been found for the spirit of
            their blasphemies, and they had begun one and another to become drunk
            on his foul dregs, and he was forging threats against the believers everywhere,
            inasmuch as the fear of God was not before his eyes, then suddenly that
            happened in his case which was once said in the case of the arrogance of
            the <persName>Assyrian</persName>, <quote>Against whom hast thou opened thy mouth and lengthened
               thy tongue, save against the Holy one of <placeName>Israel</placeName>?</quote>'. So therefore the Lord
            smote this man in his tongue, and it grew long and protruded beyond his
            mouth and came down to his breast, making a fearful sight with great swelling,
            so that he was twice lanced in it, while terror and trepidation seized all
            who saw him at the sight of him. And in this torment and manifest sentence
            of requital for his blasphemy he lingered till the fifth day of the week?
            which the blessed man fixed as the term and said, <quote>On the fifth day of the
               week God will perform what he knows</quote>. And on the same day he who<pb n="31"/>
            had threatened the blessed man received his burial and perished', and fear
            accompanied by shame seized all the partisans of that wretched man, and
            joy reigned over the believers everywhere, while everyone was amazed at
            the blessed man's words, how God wrought this miracle in him. When the
            partisans of that wretched man could not by reason of their shame find what
            to say, they devised a plan, saying, <quote>Whereas on the day which <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName>
               decreed for the patriarch he died, he used enchantments against him, and he
               died on that same day</quote>. And so these men were ashamed and God was
            glorified, and the believers rejoiced; and even the blessed man himself would
            confess that God had heard his voice, and had awoken with his sentence
            against the blasphemer. For, when he heard the openness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) of his
            blasphemies, he prayed and said, as he used to pray and say at all seasons,
            <quote><quote>The Lord awaked like a sleeper and like a man who hath shaken off his
               wine, and smote his enemies behind him</quote>?. Lord behold the blasphemies
               of presumption against thee, and <quote>Be not quiet nor silent, O God; since lo!
                  thine enemies make tumult, and they who hate thee have lifted up the head<pb n="32"/>
                  against thy people</quote></quote>; besides the other things which the blessed man used
            to repeat in his prayer and over his incense. And justice did indeed not
            delay to show the power of his prayer in that blasphemer. And so everyone
            was amazed at all the things that were done through the saint and at the
            deeds of power wrought through his prayer, and gave thanks to God, and
            especially at his labours and his petitions and his crying and his tears
            night and day, so that not one hour ever passed from him without his
            knocking at God's door. Even when he was sitting and speaking with: men,
            because his mind was dwelling above in heaven among the angels, his tears
            would suddenly gush forth perforce, while he did not wish to do this before
            men, and sobs would spring up in him, and he would beat his two hands
            upon his face, and rest his head upon his knees, and thus he would cry
            loudly. And sometimes, when he was displaying the cheerful appearance of
            laughter with his lips, in the middle of his speech at which he displayed the
            appearance of laughing sobs overpowered him, insomuch that while speaking
            with us he often did so, until by virtue of the freedom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) which I<pb n="33"/>
            enjoyed with him I went so far as to presume to say: <quote>Why is it, our
               father, that in the midst of laughing you are thus suddenly saddened by
               weeping? This tells us that your mind is not occupied with us.or in that
               which you are saying to us, that sorrow thus suddenly seizes you</quote>. But
            he would say to me, <quote>Know, my son, that I did not want to do this while
               speaking, and my sins suddenly occur to my mind, and turn my joy to
               distress</quote>. When I often entreated him between ourselves to tell me privily
            his manner of life, even adjuring him by God to inform me, he would
            again while weeping yield to constraint and say : <quote>When, my son, I am
               constrained to speak among men, my mind looks at those above in heaven,
               how their mouths cease not even for a short season from praises, and sobs
               rise within me on account of myself, how I am neglecting to praise that
               Creator who created me, and have ceased to make petitions for the forgiveness 
               of my offences, and am sitting in intercourse with men; and this and
               other things urges' me to cease speaking</quote>. And so I was amazed at this<pb n="34"/>
            saint's disposition, as well as at his humility and the kindness to strangers
            and poor men of which his soul was full with great zeal, so that in consequence 
            a multitude of the poor of the city and strangers from every place
            flocked to him on account of the report of his charity, until eighty and
            ninety and as many as a hundred tables were on some days prepared in
            his monastery. And thereupon he made great cauldrons and appointed
            men who were continually cooking and making bread; and in company
            with many he would with his own hands make himself into an attendant
            with cheerfulness and joy. While the blessed man was thus illustrious in
            all things, and deeds of power and signs were every day wrought through
            him, to narrate each one of which we have omitted since we are not sufficient, 
            the whole city used already to flock to him, with the whole senate
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σύγκλητος</foreign>), and' they who saw the great freedom of speech (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>), and
            the rebuke of those who had the power of death and life after God, were
            kept in great fear and dread of him, and everyone put great faith in him.

            Then all the heretics in the churches and monasteries were sorely dejected,
            and they cried against the king every day in great assemblies: <quote>If the<pb n="35"/>
               <persName>Syrian</persName> does not leave the city, it will be ruined</quote>, and the king and queen
            when they saw it, in order that there might not be a sedition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στάσις</foreign>) and evil
            in the city, begged him to depart from the city limits, while the queen
            prepared a place for the blessed man in a certain camp (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κάστρα</foreign>) in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1459">Thrace</placeName>
            the name of which was <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2772">Dercus</placeName> thirty miles off, and so he set out thither,
            while the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName> also the patriarch of Alexandria had been
            established there; and thereafter the blessed men dwelt there together,
            while that camp (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κάστρα</foreign>) thundered praise. And after some time again on
            account of the inclemency of this place they withdrew to another; and after
            some years the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName> finished his course and fell asleep in the same
            place, his disciple <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3212">Hananya</persName> the presbyter who 'was next to him' having
            left the place, who himself also had been trained with him during the lifetime
            of his blessed master <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3763">Habib</persName> in the manner of life of both of them. In
            these lines we have comprised the story of the holy old man <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName>, dreading
            ondemnation for the omissions of all his triumphs which we have omitted
            and passed over for the reason that our time is not long enough for these to
            relate them.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of the divine man the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1524">Zʿura</persName> is ended.
