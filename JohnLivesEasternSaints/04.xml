         <head>Next the Fourth History, of the Saints <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> the Brothers.</head>
         <p>
            These [before] our time and in our time itself gained distinction upon
            a column and seized the crown of victory through their marvellous ways of
            life; in whose case also the words found in the Psalms of the Holy Spirit
            may also aptly be sung: <quote>How good and how beautiful it is for brethren
               when they dwell together</quote>'; for to these two holy brethren alike it is
            good and beautiful and marvellous that they dwell together, as is written in
            the Psalmist. These two holy brothers were by birth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) from a village
            called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2804">Kalesh</placeName>?, in the territory of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2737">Amida</placeName>; and the elder whose name was
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> was first moved by zeal, and he went and dwelt in a monastery called
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1524">Arʿa Rabtha</placeName>” in the territory of <placeName>Ingila</placeName>. Now there was a high stone column
            to which men used to come in order to stand upon it in that monastery; and<pb n="57"/>
            after he had broken himself for a space of ten years by great labours he
            himself ascended the column. And, when his brother whose name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName>
            had seen it, he also came and entered upon the road from the first mile and
            began to walk soundly, while those two brothers were thenceforward illustrious 
            for mighty labours of abstinence, until they received gifts of the Spirit
            also, the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> receiving even the power of working healings
            and driving out demons, he being above, while his brother the blessed
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> shunned these things, saying: <quote>Sir, I will have nothing to do with
               things that' gain very vain glory for someone but deceive certain persons</quote>.
            And many would seek assistance? with these; but he when he saw these
            persons coming to be healed would shut his door and remain silent. For
            from the very beginning also he had made a great segment from a hollow
            tree and set himself up inside it, having taken it inside the enclosure in a
            certain corner (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>); and he used to stand in it. And there was a little
            door, and he would stoop and come out by it when he wanted; for this
            monastery is situated on the top of a mountain, and there used to be heavy
            snow there and violent winds; and so he would go out and remove the snow<pb n="58"/>
            and recite the service and stand, while his brother from above used to chide
            him and say to him: <quote>Wherefore are you thus killing yourself? What good
               is this to you? Why do you afflict yourself?</quote> But he would weep and say:
            <quote>Woe is me, sir, forgive me, sir. Which, pray, is the keener, this snow
               that afflicts for a little time, or the eternal torture that does not end, or the
               smoky burning of bitter thirst? Lo! how bitter is the intensity of the stress
               (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκη</foreign>) is made known by the torment of that wretched rich man'. And
               for this reason let this wretched body which has an end be tortured here,
               and, be there sorrows or joys, they will soon come to an end, and it will not last</quote>.
            When the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> heard in his soul and in his thoughts
            how God's judgment was always depicted in his heart, and, because he
            pitied him in that his colour was changing nature from the intensity of the
            snow, used to urge him to go into his tree-segment, because the blessed
            man also above found it difficult to repel the violence of the winds, he in order
            to carry out his brother's order would comply, and would go inside weeping,
            and beat upon his face and say: <quote>Woe is me woe is me the sinner;<pb n="59"/>
               who will entreat for me that I may escape from that torment?</quote> And so
            these brothers were objects of marvel, their fame going as far as the country
            of the Persians. And, when <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> [...] thirty-eight years [...] completed
            thirty eight' years on the column [...] deep and he [...] in his days, [...] When
            a great clamour everywhere arose and a great number of people in the
            villages and of the cities gathered together, they went up [...] the blessed
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName>. And what was purposed in the heart of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> was
            not known to anyone; but when a ladder had been set up he first went up;
            and, when he stood at the top of the ladder, he found the holy old man
            bending down and sitting with his face to the <placeName>east</placeName> with his head between
            his knees, and he bade him a farewell; and so he took him up and carried
            him out weeping, and handed him towards [...] below him? [...] the cast and for
            himself and prayed. And he entered and went [to] his brother's [place].
            And the multitude (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όχλος</foreign>) [was seized with sorrow] and affliction on his
            account that was more than that in memory of the holy blessed man <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName>,
            while they cried and said, <quote>Do us a kindness, our <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName>; and, if so be you
               are thus purposed, [come down] and first comfort us [and] go up at once in
               peace, because we shall all be made glad by this. And, if you do not come<pb n="60"/>
               down, we will all go up there</quote>. And, being from affliction and many sighs
            unable to speak to the people, he beckoned to them with his hand to be
            silent and wait for him. And, when he had suppressed his own tears for
            a short time and restrained his weeping, he then said to them: <quote>Brethren,
               pray for me, and leave me alone. I for my part did not desire this and my
               Lord knows, but, in order that my holy brother's place may not be vacant,
               I hope by his prayers that, until you bring me down as he came down, I shall
               henceforth not come down hence. But take the saint and wrap him up
               for burial, and go; and pray for me, that I may not be deprived of my brother
               <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName>'s portion with all the saints. Now take away the ladder, and pray
               for me</quote>. When this had been done and the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> had been
            wrapped up, the assembly dispersed, and each man went to his place in
            peace, being amazed and glorifying God'. But the blessed man would in
            great affliction cry night and day to God, saying, <quote>My Lord, let not this
               stone be to me a conductor to torment, but a conductor to life</quote>.
         </p>
         <p>
            The first instance in which the power of the prayers of the saint was seen
            happened in the case of me the wretched one the writer of these things.<pb n="61"/>
            My parents were acquainted with him, and every son who was born to them
            used to die at the end of a year and a half or two years: and, when I myself
            was born and came into this perturbed life, and' on the same day as my
            brothers the stroke that had slain them attacked me, as my parents used to tell
            me, they immediately repaired to the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName>, carrying me and weeping
            with sobs, crying to him, <quote>Have mercy upon us, and pray to God for this
               one who has remained to us. Perhaps God will hear your prayers, and save
               him; since, if your prayers do not persuade God, this child, to judge from
               the example (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σημείον</foreign>) of his brothers, is already housed in the grave</quote>.
            Then the blessed man, seeking to silence my parents' sobs, said to them:
            <quote>Be quiet, be quiet. <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/74">John</persName> shall not die before <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName></quote>. Then, as they used
            to say to me, I was struck with silence as it were to death; and my <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3624">mother</persName>
            wailed with a loud voice, and said: <quote>Sir, he is dead</quote>. Thereupon what
            happened? The blessed man (they said) in answer to the woman's vehement 
            wailing jested and said: <quote>Do not wail, woman. <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/74">John</persName> shall not die before me</quote>.
            And, guarding against the suspicion of pride like a wise
            merchant who keeps his riches that they may not be seen and plundered, and<pb n="62"/>
            to make these persons think that it was not he who was the cause of the
            deliverance, he said to my <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3624">mother</persName> laughing: <quote>Believe in our Lord and go,
               take yourself into the refectory (?)', and ask for some lentils from the servitors'? 
               cauldron, and bring them to him, and he will at once live and recover,
               and eat of them</quote>. And she, as thinking that he was jesting with her in
            order to silence her, herself went on wailing more than before, saying,
            <quote>Henceforth, sir, this child's lentils are ripening in the grave. This child
               will now never again taste lentils here</quote>. The holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> says to her: <quote>See,
                  you do not believe that from these lentils of these brothers you will gain a
                  son, through the help of the prayers of the same brothers</quote>. Then he said
            (they told me) to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3626">a certain brother</persName> who was present: <quote>Brother, go in and
               fetch some lentils in a cup, and drop them into that baby's mouth</quote>. That
            brother also (they told me) says: <quote>Sir, for the baby, pray for him. This
               baby has already passed to that world</quote>. And again (they said) he repeated
            to that brother, <quote>Go do as I have told you</quote>. That brother, in order not
            to oppose the intent of his command, went laughing and saying: <quote>I am
               going to raise your son from the dead by the eating of lentils</quote>. And he<pb n="63"/>
            went in and fetched the lentils and came (they said) and stood above me,
            and said to the blessed man: <quote>Sir, here are the lentils. You will see one
               who is dead eating lentils</quote>. The saint says to him: <quote>Take some with
                  your finger, and insert them into his mouth three times</quote>. And that brother
            (they said) took them and inserted them into my mouth, saying: <quote>See!
               These things have been done to no purpose</quote>. And at the third time (they
            said) I opened my eyes, and moved my tongue round, and tasted and turned
            round and roused myself. And then they cried to the blessed man, <quote>Sir,
               sir, pray; and perhaps our Lord will effect a deliverance by your prayers,
               for the child has roused himself</quote>. But the blessed man did not see them;
            because women used to stand and speak to him from one gate of the enclosure
            as far behind him as a woman's voice will carry, and they were not allowed
            to set foot inside, and he also never saw the face (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) of a woman,
            but her speech' only. Then he said to my <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3624">mother</persName>: <quote>Give him lentils to
               eat as much as he wants, and take him and go, rear him for two more years,
               and bring him to me here; because this is my son, and there is no possibility 
               of his dying until his <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName> is buried</quote>. And so they took me and<pb n="64"/>
            went away; and, after two years, they gave me to the blessed man my spiritual
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName>, by whose prayers I was saved from death; and the power of his
            blessing was dissolved and nullified through my evil deeds; for God used
            to work acts of great and marvellous power through him in all the words
            that he spoke even when laughing. And from that time the multitude (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όχλος</foreign>)
            began to gather together to the saint in numbers many times as great as
            came to his brother <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName>; which' was also very hateful to him that
            anyone should come and bring him a sick person or one possessed with a
            demon, but he would at once drive him out, saying these words: <quote>O 
               wretched men, what has misled you into leaving God's altar and his great power
               which took up its dwelling in the saints who were slain for his name, and
               loved him and did his will, and coming to me the wretched man and provoker
               of God? Indeed (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρα</foreign>), if I were one who pleased and loved God and did his
               will, you ought not to have come to me and neglected the saints, let alone
               when I provoke and irritate God. And there is another thing that you
               should know and understand, that it was because of my sins that I came up
               here to ask mercy like every man, not because of my righteousness. To<pb n="65"/>
               myself the madman and man of evil life why do you come?</quote> And so this
            wonderful man as if to drive arrogance from him and avoid the vain praise
            of men, even though he was gentle and kind, would violently and with anger
            those who came to him to gaze at him as a great and righteous
            man. Yet again, if he were vexed with any particular persons, he would
            at last as if to entreat and console say reproachfully and kindly these words:
            <quote>My sons, be not vexed at what I am saying to you. You do not know
               the evil one's wiliness and deceitfulness. If I give way to these matters
               of sick and possessed persons, and allow them an opportunity of coming to
               me, lo! fiends will at once go and seize women and girls and many persons,
               be it by means of a fever, or of ulcers, or of affection of the eyes, or of
               affection of the head, or so as to foam in them, and will work in them without
               their knowledge, as if one were to say <quote>Go jeer in the face of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName></quote>, for, as
               soon as they bring them here, as if our own prayers were indeed powerful
               and mighty and drove out fiends, the fiends who have brought about these
               diseases will abandon them, and in their deceitfulness depart and withdraw,
               in order to carry out the wiles of their deceitfulness, and cheat us into having<pb n="66"/>
               some such thought of ourselves as that we ourselves are indeed righteous
               and expellers of demons and healers of diseases, so that by this means
               we may be puffed up and be arrogant, so as to add disaster to disaster,
               and receive blows upon blows, and cease and remit these constant petitions
               to God for our sins, as if we were indeed righteous, and through the guilefulness 
               of the demons' deceitfulness cease the rapid running on the road of
               repentance for our sins, and utterly sink in the stormy sea of sins, and there
               be fulfilled against us the saying <quote>Their days were consumed in vanity,
                  and their years rapidly</quote>', which also happened to many, and they childishly
               yielded to the deceitfulness of the demons, and thought that what was done
               to them through the deceits of the fiends was true, and fell and were caught
               in the depths of evils, through the vain suppositions that they were indeed
               casting out demons and healing diseases, and do not understand that they
               are sitting in a dark house, and their heart is feeding on ashes, and they
               are making their souls a dwelling-place for demons, and filling parts of
               themselves with the stain of sins, and the demons are mocking at them
               because they are indeed casting them out without considering our Lord's<pb n="67"/>
               saying which he uttered beforehand to these men, which shall be spoken to
               them, when they shall say <quote>My Lord, my Lord, did we not in thy name
                  prophesy, and in thy name cast out fiends, and in thy name do many deeds
                  of power?</quote>, then shall the bridegroom answer and say to them, <quote>Verily I say
                     unto you I know you not, depart ye from me workers of iniquity, go to the
                     fire prepared for the devil and for his angels</quote>'. Now, my sons, who will
               not tremble at the pronouncement of despair addressed to those who yielded
               to the deceitfulness of the fiends' guilefulness, who thought that they were
               casting them out, when he hears from the good Lord <quote>I know thee not</quote>?
               As for my wretched and sinful self, as I have probed the deceits of the
               demons, it is enough for me to drive them out of my stained self only; for
               to me it seems that the saints who truly possessed power and authority from
               God over these used to shrink from and shun being made spoil of, let alone
               us who, while all the wickedness of the demons is ambushed within us,
               and all their envy and their deceit and their desires, think of ourselves that
               we are driving fiends out of one another. Would that I were driving my
               own out</quote><pb n="68"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            By saying these things every day to many the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName> did not per<pb n="68"/>suade
            men not to come to him every day; and, being distressed, and it not
            being open to him to act as he did in his brother's days by withdrawing when
            he saw these, accordingly, in order to extinguish out of him the reputation of
            gravity, he would speak to many with simple and ridiculous words, and like a
            fool, saying, <quote>Why then (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρα</foreign>) come you to a madman? Have you, pray, seen
               anyone fouler than I am? Since I am bound to this stone like a malefactor,
               or as a vicious dog is bound by a chain that he may not escape and do hurt
               not that, if it were open to me to escape hence, I should
               like each one of you have both made a house for myself and had a wife and
               children? or understand you not that in my case also it is on account of my
               sins and my spots and my crimes that God bound me to this stone, like a
               judge who puts a criminal in bonds?</quote> But those who knew the blessed
            man's character and way of life used to say when they heard these things:
            <quote>Yes, sir, we also are come as to a criminal, and as to one who is bound;
               for a man goes and sees even murderers when they are bound in prison</quote>.
            But those who were not thoroughly acquainted with him, who saw the<pb n="69"/>
            blessed man thus distressed by the multitude of people and crying that they
            hindered him from holding intercourse with God, wondered greatly. Once <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3627">a
               certain layman</persName> came to him whose <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3628">wife</persName> was barren and bore no children;
            and he knew his disposition, and had gained the privilege of free speech
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) with him, and by chance he came in and found him removing his
            nails, because his toe-nails were of vigorous growth, so that they were a
            finger or two fingers long. And, having prayed and sat down and begun
            to speak, he says to him: <quote>Sir, pray for your bondmaid that she may have
               children, since I have no heir and hope of my house.</quote> But he looked at him
            and wondered, and he says to him: <quote>Then (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρα</foreign>), so-and-so, how is it
               do not consider the words that you are speaking to the most wretched
               of all men? How is it that you say these things to me? llave you not
               heard the blessed apostle saying, <quote>If a man hath not been able to rule his
                  own house aright, how will he be able to rule God's church?</quote> How will
               one who has not been able to pray for his soul, which has become by its
               disposition barren of the progeny of good deeds, and through his prayer
               made it fruitful in spiritual progeny, be able to pray for women that they<pb n="70"/>
               may bear children?</quote> The man says to him: <quote>Sir, there is no difficulty
                  with God in making the former fruitful as well as the latter. And if
                  wish you will have mercy upon me. By God who chose you do not neglect
                  me</quote>. When he heard that he adjured him by God, he was moved by two 
            considerations, one that he did not wish to state of himself at all that he could
            do any such thing, and another that he heard God's name and his heart
            trembled; and he said to that man: <quote>Why did you adjure me by God
               about a matter that is not my concern and is too hard for me? Accordingly
               take what I will give you without men being aware it of, and go hang it on
               your wife, and you shall have a son, and you shall call his name <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1885">Maro</persName>, no
               man being aware of it</quote>. And he took one of his toe-nails and wrapt it
            gave it him; and, in order that he might not honour it as a martyr,
            he said to him: <quote>Observe that it is not a martyr, nor is this bundle <foreign>hnana</foreign>';
               but it is a herb that I give you. See that no one undo and see it; and next
               year you shall carry your son also and bring this herb with him to me</quote>.
            Then that man took it and went; and he hung it on his wife; and at once
            God gave to her and she received conception, and she bare a son. When
            this happened, it seemed to everyone no ordinary wonder that so-and-so the<pb n="71"/>
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3628">barren woman</persName> had received conception; so that to many it presented itself as
            a matter of doubt that so-and-so <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3628">the barren woman</persName> had received conception,
            until her conception came to delivery. And, many being amazed, they used
            to assemble before her and in great wonder eagerly inquire, <quote>What is the
               cause from which this has been brought about in you after so long a time?</quote>
            But she, fearing the saint's injunction, and in order that the power of his
            prayer and the miracle wrought for God's glory might not be concealed,
            announced to everyone: <quote>So-and-so the blessed man sent me something,
               and I do not know what it is, and God gave me a son</quote>. Then all men in
            amazement glorified God. And many are the things that God wrought
            through these two holy brothers, things that even surpass written records
            and the capacity of the ears; but the acts of the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1546">Abraham</persName> even far
            surpass those of this man'. But this is enough that I have undertaken to
            shorten his history and run through it in simple fashion, observing two
            things, one that miracles are from their character dillicult to believe, and
            another that I have determined in my mind not to be a witness with my<pb n="72"/>
            handwriting except only of things confirmed by the sight of my eyes as well
            as the written record, and not to repeat in writing what I have only heard',
            but the things that I have both heard and also seen to these I bear witness;
            as in the case of this saint also I bring to record the same deeds that I
            have seen and know, those that are small and a litile inferior, because of
            the unbelief and doubt of many, abstaining from mentioning marvels that
            are greater than the ears can bear. Even the actual things that we have
            repeated we have repeated for the glory of God, and that God's love towards
            those who love him and keep his commandments may be known to us ordinary
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ιδιώτης</foreign>) and simple men, and how great freedom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) God gives to his
            bondmen before him. There was again <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3629">a certain magistrate</persName> in the same
            village in which this saint had his stand (with whom I also was well acquainted) 
            who was an abominable and impious man, an oppressor of the poor,
            and one who caused orphans and widows to groan, and a perpetrator of
            all wicked deeds of covetousness and of injustice and of rapine; and he had
            much property and a great house, and bondmen and bondwomen. And
            that man bore himself proudly in the world; and the orphans and widows
            and other poor persons used always to flee from him and take refuge<pb n="73"/>
            with the blessed man. Then the saint would send and fetch him and
            gently entreat him, admonishing him and saying: <quote>My son, beware, and
               keep what God has given you, for you are not in need. Wherefore do
               you oppress these broken-hearted poor, not one of whom has daily bread
               in his house? Remember the scripture that says, <quote>The orphans and the
                  widows and them that turn to me ye shall not overreach nor defraud</quote>';
               and again <quote>I am the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName> of the orphans and the judge of the widows</quote>?;
               and again, <quote>By reason of the plundering of the poor and the groaning
                  of the needy, therefore will I arise, saith the Lord, and I will make 
                  deliverance openly</quote>s. But for my part I pity you, my son; since, however much
               God's justice turns away, it is impossible that it will not some time be
               roused against evil-doers</quote>; and again, <quote>Neither yet think that this
                  the saints before whom these poor people come and groan is a void thing; lest
                  it beroused against you, and you and your house perish.</quote> But that wretched
            man stirred himself up arrogantly at the instigation of his <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName> the devil,
            whose will he did according to what our Lord said to the Jews, <quote>The will
               of your <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName> ye do</quote>', so this man derided and scorned the man of God,<pb n="74"/>
            saying, <quote>Blessed man, sit on your stone, and mind your own business. I will
               not neglect matters which I know to be proper for me. Sit in your monastery
               and be quiet, and you have no concern with me, and I none with you. Every
               man's sins or righteousness as the case may be falls to his lot. Those who
               are going up to heaven will not entreat for me</quote>. When that captive man
            whom the evil one had taken captive had said these things, he turned his
            ace to go out from the blessed man's presence; but the blessed man was
            distressed and wept, and, carried away by his feelings, called him with a loud
            voice and said to him: <quote>Woe for you, my son! a pronouncement of wrath
               has gone out against you from heaven (for think not that I the sinner have
               cursed you; far be it from me). But repent and I with you will entreat
               God's justice for you, and perhaps you will be delivered</quote>. But he became
            more hardened, and said: <quote>Let justice do what it likes</quote>; and so he departed;
            while the blessed man shed tears and said: <quote>I, my son, am innocent of your
               sin. You know</quote>. But at midnight fire broke out from the four corners
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>) of his house, while the blessed man saw it descending and coming
            down from heaven to earth like a ball (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σφαίρα</foreign>); and so that flame immediately
            made itself master of his house and his property, and seized all his furniture;<pb n="75"/>
            and the man with <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3633">his domestic slaves</persName> hardly escaped naked because God
            wished to make his presumption known to him, while all the precious
            belongings and valuable furniture and the rest of the property contained in the
            buildings (?) were all burnt. But the blessed man, when he saw it, weeping
            called his own <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName> who stood before him, and said to him: <quote>Go my
               son to that wretched man and see what has happened to him</quote>; telling him
            with great sorrow what had occurred. And the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName> with two brothers
            went to the village by night, and they found all the buildings (?) of the house
            levelled with the ground, and blazing so much that the stones themselves
            looked like coals of flame, and were all dissolved into chalk within the fire.
            And fever and dysentery at once attacked that man, and in ten days he died;
            and his wife survived, a great and distinguished woman; and the rest of the
            property that remained to him was ruined; and of the vineyards and the fields
            that were thick with their trees and their fruits, and were regarded with awe (?)
            in the neighbourhood, some sank to the ground in two years, and the rest
            were plundered from the owners(?)'; and of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3633">the slaves</persName> some died, and some
            ran away; and the woman herself became blind; and so receiving the com:
            mand (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έντολή</foreign>) the woman also died, and she became a subject of gossip and<pb n="76"/>
            of lamentation; while the blessed man, whenever the memory of them came
            into his mind, would say to us mournfully with many sighs: <quote>See, my sons,
               how the fiends destroy God's creation. How can we avoid shedding bitter
               tears for this poor man, when we think how far the evil one puffed him up
               until he destroyed him, and even blotted out his memory from the earth?</quote>
            But for many days, while we were kneeling before him at the end of the
            service, because sometimes the service was performed in his presence, he
            would with many tears speak to us these words of admonition from the divine
            Scriptures: <quote>See, my sons, how we stand, and what majesty we take upon
               our tongues. Take care, lest we stand before that awful and mighty Being
               as corpses without sense, while our hidden man has been secretly made
               captive by our deceitful adversary, lest we make a mockery of God when
               we stand before him, lest we insult the honour of his glory, who does not
               himself need our praise, but because of his gracious mercy called forth by the
               praise of him draws us to himself</quote>. At another time again, that is always
            when he was thinking with wonder of that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3629">magistrate</persName> and remembering him
            with tears, he would again turn the warning toward us by way of admonition,<pb n="77"/>
            saying, <quote>See, my sons, again how severe and awful and rapid is the sentence
               of the fall of pride, and beware of it, observing how many high and powerful
               men it has overthrown. And why repeat many instances, when it cast down
               from heaven to earth and overthrew him who himself causes it among men;
               even as he also to-day is again in the same fashion eager to overthrow
               everyone as he was overthrown, just as that wretched <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3629">magistrate</persName> also was
               suddenly consumed and destroyed by his pride and haughtiness? Let us fear,
               and tremble, and entreat <persName>Christ</persName> our God to repel it from us by the prayers
               of his saints</quote>. Concerning the rest of the admonition which treated of every
            form of life in his discourse, and concerning his warning and his exhortation
            addressed not to us only, but to laymen also as well, and even to women and
            children and fathers and all classes, what is there to write and say? To the
            brothers who were with him he would offer spiritual education and warnings
            and exhortation to spiritual things, and to his own priests and those of the
            villages and all who resorted to him he would give expositions of the solemnity 
            of their service and the magnitude of the penalty, and the greatness
            also of the glory, and would incite and warn them to stand earnestly and
            with fear in their stations and serve in their classes; laymen again and women<pb n="78"/>
            he would restrain from oaths and blasphemies and adultery and the other
            evil things, and exhort to good things, declaring to them also the awful
            sentence of justice, besides the other things which in the gentleness of his
            mercifulness toward all men he' disseminates. But after a space of about
            twenty years during which this saint stood upon the column a revelation was
            shown to him concerning the terrible hosts of barbarians, i. e. Huns’, who
            should come forth to chastise men upon earth.
         </p>
         <p>
            Then with mournful weeping he continued with a loud voice vehemently
            giving vent to his sorrow in the middle of the night and wailing out of a
            mournful heart, beating on his face and speaking to God thus: <quote>What,
               Lord, will happen to thy churches and thy monasteries? What, my Lord,
               wilt thou do to thine altars and thy service and thy sacred vessels, Lord?
               Woe to us whose sins have brought these things to pass, and not thy gentleness.
               What will happen to thy priests and the people of the believers,
               whose corpses are cast out as dung upon the face of the earth with none
               to bury them? In mercy chastise me and not in anger, Lord</quote>. And, when
            all of us heard the voice from above in the monastery within, having all
            been awoken we were agitated; and, because it was a short time before ser<pb n="79"/>vice,
            we did not ourselves dare to go into his enclosure; but the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName>
            who was next after him went in, and cried out and said to him, <quote>Sir, give
               your blessing</quote>, three times. And then he ceased his sobbing, and the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName> 
            said to him, <quote>Why, sir, is your holiness distressed with weeping,
               and so above all when speaking?</quote> But the saint said to him: <quote>My son, go,
                  and wake the brethren, and stand up to prayer; and grieve for my' latter end,
                  for what times I have been preserved, and what in my days my eyes see and
                  my ears hear</quote>. And, when his sobs came up more than ever, the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName>,
            having been himself also seized with trembling, continued crying to him and
            saying: <quote>What is the matter with you, sir? Tell me what it is</quote>. Then
            he said to him: <quote>My son, go and pray; because a sword has gone forth
               from the presence of the Lord, and slaughter has prevailed among the believers, 
               and also over the churches and monasteries, because men have provoked
               God</quote>. And the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName> said, <quote>If you please?, I entreat you to inform me
                  what you have seen</quote>. Then the blessed man was angry and said to him:
            <quote>Remove yourself now, my son, from my presence. Have you not come
               to pry? Please go and recite the service; or, if not, begone now from here</quote>.
            And they went out and stood up in service and in prayer all the night until<pb n="80"/>
            the morning. But after twenty days the hosts of the Huns came forth, and
            they covered the land of the <placeName>East</placeName>, and none so numerous as they had appeared
            in the land of the <persName>Romans</persName>, nor had it ever been heard that any Huns except
            these presumed to cross the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>;' indeed even among the blessed man's
            companions also arose haste to flee to the fortress, while they said to him,
            <quote>Sir, if you please we will carry you down, lest we leave you alone and
               you suffer distress, or they burn the monastery or anything happen to you
               yourself</quote>. But he in confidence in his Lord said to them, and again not
            by way of boasting: <quote>I, my sons, am ready for suffering, and my life and
               death are in God's hands. Go, and the Lord be with you, and pray for me</quote>.
            When they saw it, three of them, trusting in the blessed man's prayers,
            bravely remained, while he was unaware that they had remained, and the
            rest fled to the fortress. But those who remained went in to him, and he
            saw them and was astonished, saying: <quote>Have you not gone away, my
               sons?</quote>, and they say to him: <quote>Either life or death is better for us with
                  you, our <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3625">father</persName></quote>. But he said to them: <quote>Pray, my sons, that we may not<pb n="81"/>
                     die in sin; but, if not, men cannot kill us, because <quote>they who are with us
                        are more than they who are with them</quote>'. But these things I did not say
                     to you before, in order that we ourselves also may fulfil every man's lot; for
                     if it were open to me I also would have fled, in order that we may not seem
                     to be in any thing better than the rest of men</quote>. But the heart of those who
            had remained with him was agitated, though they were encouraged by him,
            and they continued peering out on all sides, and they liſted up their eyes
            and see, and lo! a host of horsemen appeared before the monastery; and
            they themselves trembled and were disturbed; and they ran to the blessed
            man and say: <quote>Sir, pray, because the evil has come. Sir, what shall we
               do? Lo! they surround us</quote>. But the blessed man continued beating on his
            face, saying, <quote>What, my sons, can I say? What? Am I myself better than
               all those who are now being cut in pieces and cast out, and are being eaten
               by beasts and by birds?</quote> But the host of the barbarians, when they had
            reached a distance of half a mile from the monastery, overtook men who
            were fleeing toward the blessed man's monastery, and with cries uttered
            in their language they pursued them, and they advanced as far as the monastery 
            fence; and those who were fleeing before them escaped inside. And<pb n="82"/>
            these, like men who are driven along or whose eyes are blinded or whom a
            deceiver carries along so that they do not see, passed round the monastery
            hall on one side and half on the other, and, just as if those whom they were
            pursuing were running before them, they passed by the gate of the monastery
            on this side and on that, thinking that they were just overtaking and catching
            the fugitives. And this their shouting indicated; since, while there was no
            one in front of them, they themselves continued crying and running, and so
            they passed round the blessed man's monastery, and not one of them entered
            within it; and so it is believed by everyone that it was not even seen by
            them at all, because they passed by the side of its walls and gates, and did
            not even lift up their eyes and look upon the site of one of its sides, although
            it is seen even at a great distance, and the blessed man's station moreover
            is seen above, being black. And so by the help of his prayers neither was
            the monastery harmed, nor anyone who was in it or round it, though in
            all the villages round it complete destruction was carried out, and even in
            the village itself they were for a whole day, and, while the whole monastery
            and the blessed man were seen by the village like a sun, their eyes were
            blinded, and they did not see him. Many such things God used to perform<pb n="83"/>
            through the blessed man's prayers; though, if I had undertaken to tell all
            the things that were performed in sick men through the outward word only
            without his applving his touch to these, either in the case of demons who
            came out, or in that of the other acts of healing, one by one, I should have
            wandered into a greatly protracted series of stories; but these few out of
            many are enough to stir up praise to God in those who are convinced by them.
            As to the time of his standing he completed on the column in this trial of
            endurance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) twenty-nine years and fifteen days, and in the tree-segment
            in his brother's days he passed eleven years, so that for the time of the trial
            of endurance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) in which he laboured there are made up forty years'.
            Bat as to the rest of his labours and the painfulness of his standing and the
            austerity of his habits I reckon it superfluous to write. But his successor
            is his own <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3630">presbyter</persName>, his kinsman, a man who from the very earliest time,
            when he himself was not standing on the column, himself also walked rightly
            and soundly in his very footsteps. For, even while the saint was alive,
            all men used to congratulate him, because such a man was standing before<pb n="84"/>
            him; and after him he bore all his burden and that also of the whole convent
            with stainless purity without murmur and without complaint; while the fame
            of his kindness and of his own habits also was everywhere spoken, through
            the charity to the poor which he possessed, and the love towards his brethren, 
            and the reception of strangers, who used to carry his fame everywhere. But, 
            after the blessed man's decease, he made himself a hut and a
            station in the enclosure itself, and therein carried out his labour and his
            abstinence; but he did not as yet mount the column. But I removed myself
            thence because of the neighbourhood of bodily kin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>), and joined
            myself to the communities of the <persName>Amidenes</persName>, while they themselves were in
            the exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) decreed by the heretics.
