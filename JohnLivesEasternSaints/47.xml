         <head>Next the Fourty-Seventh History, Concerning the Holy Comunnities Which <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/779">Theodora</persName> the Queen Gathered Together in Constantinople, 
            Communities from Every Place in the Royal City Which Were Gathered Together in the Royal Mansion Called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2793">That of Hormisdas</placeName> by the 
            Believing Queen <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/779">Theodora</persName> Whose Soul Is at Rest.</head>
         <p>
            On the subject therefore of the community of blessed men which was
            <pb n="677"/><pb n="475"/>gathered together in the royal city by the believing queen at the time of
            the persecution, out of many peoples and various local tongues, we wish to
            leave a record at short length; and the history of it is sufficient to cause
            discerning men to marvel at it, since it was indeed composed of many blessed
            men who did not fall short of the number of five hundred, and with<note></note> great
            and venerable old men; and the congregation of persecuted saints was so
            widely extended that it shone with many who had under the constraint of
            the persecution come down from columns and been ejected from places of
            seclusion, and been expelled from districts, and their congregation was
            rendered illustrious by great and distinguished heads of convents from all
            quarters of the east and of the west, and <placeName>Syria</placeName> and <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>
            and <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, <placeName>Isauria</placeName> and <placeName>Lycaonia</placeName>, and <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2746">Asia</placeName> and <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and <placeName>Byzantium</placeName>,
            countries which beyond others burned with zeal for the faith, while one
            might consequently go into <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2793">the palace (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παλάτιον</foreign>) itself called that of Hormisdas</placeName>, 
            as into a great and marvellous desert of solitaries, and marvel at their
            numbers, and wonder at their venerable appearance, and the same men's
            honoured old age, and be affected by the crucifixion of their bodies and their
            practices of standing and the same men's spiritual songs which were heard
            <pb n="678"/><pb n="476"/>from all sides, and at their marvellous canticles and their melancholy voices
            which were performed and attered in all the chambers and courts (vcrsic) and
            cells and halls (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίχλινος</foreign>) of that palace (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παλάτιον</foreign>), and they were ranged in order
            and full in every place, and they were crowded and packed and their cells were
            full, as well as every chamber and room in that place; while one might see
            in each of the great halls (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίχλινος</foreign>) that they were filled by rows of planks,
            for by the care of the queen cells had been made and provided for the old and
            great and honoured men among them, and some of the stylites and recluses
            and solitaries, besides all the quantity of cells that were in all the quarters of
            that palace (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παλάτιον</foreign>), and besides the great community which in one chamber
            had as it were the organization of one convent and one service, and an
            archimandrite and a steward, and servitors<note></note> and a table together, and were
            continually governed according to the whole perfect organization of a convent;
            while all the other halls (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίχλινος</foreign>) besides, as we have stated above, were full
            of the blessed men's cells and booths, some of wood and some of curtains,
            and some of matting and so on, while severe labours and protracted fasts and
            constant vigils and perpetual prayers, as well as celebrations and descents of
            <pb n="679"/><pb n="477"/>the Spirit in every place were being carried on, while altars were fixed up
            everywhere, so that in consequence not only<note></note> did the believing people run
            to the amazing sight, and see and marvel and be astonished and wonder at
            these spiritual congregations, and run to each one of these saints to be blessed
            and to be assisted by their prayers, but even some of those who did not
            belong to their communion would run to that amazing community about
            which they had heard, and see and marvel and be astonished and dumbfounded
            and edified, and would give thanks to God, and in consequence a great
            number of the people of the city like a full river turned aside to these holy
            communities, and flowed on and overflowed at all times; insomuch that many
            of the participators with the synod of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName>, which was a cause of scandal
            and of the persecution of the blessed men, when they saw this marvellous
            community, and learned the causes of the persecution of it, had their mind
            filled with affliction and contrition, and renounced the <persName>Chalcedonian communion</persName>, 
            and asked for communion with them, and thus many were added to the
            believers; while the believing queen also would regularly once in every two
            or three days come down to them to be blessed by them, being amazed at
            <pb n="680"/><pb n="478"/>or very carelesly composed, and the emendations are doubtful.
            their community and their practices, and admiring their honoured old age,
            and going round among them and making obeisance to them, and being
            regularly blessed by each one of them, while she provided the expenses
            required for them liberally in every thing; while the king also, who was
            ranged against them on account of <placeName>the synod of Chalcedon</placeName>, marvelled at their
            congregation, and himself also was attached to many of them and trusted
            them, and was constantly received and blessed by them. And thus this
            great community became illustrious by a variety of practices all the days of the
            blessed queen's life, while even after her death<note></note> she laid an injunction upon
            the king about it, and it was preserved, and all the lifetime of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName> the
            king he looked after them and honoured them, and supported the remnant of
            them, even to the present time which is the year eight hundred and seventy-seven<note></note>, 
            that is the remnant that was left of it to the present time (but it is
            the same); while our meanness also from the beginning of the collection of
            this community and before it was completely collected, and even down to
            this time at which we have in it set down the record that tells of it (since for
            a considerable time we were with it also in the same royal city at that time)
            <pb n="681"/><pb n="479"/>was<note></note> with it first on account of the persecution, and at the end which is the
            rest of all this long time, which passes thirty years<note></note>, on account of the
            conversion from the error of paganism, which as by the dispensation and
            assistance of God's grace was performed in the districts of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2746">Asia</placeName> by the
            instrumentality of our meanness, so that eighty thousand were converted
            and rescued from paganism, and ninety-eight churches and twelve monasteries, 
            and seven other churches transformed from Jewish synagogues were
            founded in these four provinces (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπαρχίας</foreign>)<note></note>, <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2746">Asia</placeName>, <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2764">Caria</placeName>, <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2833">Phrygia</placeName>, and <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2811">Lydia</placeName>.
            These things we have recorded for the glory of God, and, in case anyone
            should find fault or be offended on account of the length of our stay in the
            royal city, by way of explanation<note></note>.
         </p>
         <p>
            It would not be irrelevant to set down also a record of the loving care of
            God that was shown to this community from the beginning even to the end.
            Since, as we said before, a great congregation amounting to thousands in
            number used to assemble in the presence of the blessed men for the sake of
            their blessings and their prayers, and to have the privilege of receiving the
            <pb n="682"/><pb n="480"/>oblation consecrated hy them in one of the great halls (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίχλινος</foreign>), inside which
            there was also a martyrs' chapel, one day, when a great crowd was assembled
            and it was filled from end to end, on account of the great weight of the people
            suddenly at the time of the celebration that chamber broke in and fell,
            thousands of people going down with it. And, when shrieking and terror
            and panic suddenly arose, so that the sound of the shrieking was heard a long
            distance, as far as the great palace (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παλάτιον</foreign>), and a sudden report went about
            <quote>Many thousands of those who do not assent to the synod have been killed</quote>,
            then indeed the descent of God's mercifulness descended<note></note>, and was made
            manifest upon these multitudes by the prayers of the saints themselves, so
            that not one soul among them perished, and there was not a hurt on the body
            of any of them, although many fell on the top of one another, among them
            women carrying their children; and thus they all rose from that fall, and it
            was only from the terror and panic that some of them received a shock. And
            they came out thanking and praising and blessing God who saved them from
            death, and all who saw them wondered at this great miracle of deliverance
            from death which had happened to them; while this story filled the king and
            <pb n="683"/><pb n="481"/>queen and the magnates also, and the rest of the people throughout the city
            with astonishment, and called forth praise and thanksgiving to God, and
            rendered the community of the blessed men itself honourable in the eyes of
            everyone, so that at last the king sent, and made the hall (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τρίχλινος</foreign>) itself that
            fell a portico. And a second miracle which God wrought in the place where
            this holy community was happened as follows.
         </p>
         <p>
            After the death of the believing <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/779">Theodora</persName> the queen, when this community 
            had also lost some of its earlier numbers, the adversaries were
            stirred up with envy against it, and induced the king to eject them from the
            former place, and remove them to another place belonging to the crown
            called the house of Urbicus<note></note>. And, while a few of the holy old men were
            in these cells, the adversaries introduced some women with their husbands,
            and others who were not chaste, and filled the place where the blessed men
            lived, where the sacrament and the service of God used to be performed;
            and, whereas these men thought to defile the saints' dwelling, God purified
            it by a sudden fire, in that fire fell and burnt the whole of that place, only
            <pb n="684"/><pb n="482"/>a small portion of it escaping, while the fire also caught some of these women
            themselves and burnt them. And so at last it was given to the martyrs'
            chapel of the holy Mar <persName>Sergius</persName>, and a monastery was built on that spot;
            and it remains to the present time to the glory of God, and for the purpose
            of the confession of his name, and to fulfil that which is written, <quote>The Lord
               knoweth his own and is known by his own</quote><note></note>.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history concerning the communities which <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/779">Theodora</persName> the queen gathered
            together in <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> is ended.
