         <head>Next the Forty-Eighth History, of the Five Blessed Patriarchs Who Distinguished 
            Themselves in Exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) in the Time of the Persecution.</head>
         <p>
            It seemed to us a necessary thing and one that is very proper that by
            means of written memorials the history also of the perfect blessed fathers
            and great and spiritual pastors, the arch-fathers, the five patriarchs, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/51">Severus</persName>,
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName>, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1592">Anthimus</persName>, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1463">Sergius</persName>, and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1977">Paul</persName>, should be given to the knowledge
            <pb n="685"/><pb n="483"/>of posterity in writing, among whom the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/51">Severus</persName> like a valiant and
            heroic man first distinguished himself in mighty and intense conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>)
            of persecution, having been chased from the city of Antioch, and departed
            to the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName>, and withdrawn to the deserts of Egypt, while he
            carried out to the full the monastic model in which he had before also
            lived a life of austerity and poverty, and he engaged in a splendid conflict
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) of contention against <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/579">Julian of Halicarnassus</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n483-1"/>. Besides him moreover
            the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName> also besides was chased and departed from <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName>.
            While these were in banishment<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n483-2"/>, the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1592">Anthimus</persName>, who was bishop
            of the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/3059">Trebizond</placeName>, was summoned<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n483-3"/> to the royal city, and on account
            of the excellence of his mode of life he was raised to the throne (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θρόνος</foreign>) of
            the royal city itself; and, when he had retained the administration of that
            great throne (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θρόνος</foreign>) for a considerable number of years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n483-4"/>, and had heard and
            learned about the persecution of the blessed men <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/51">Severus</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n483-5"/> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName>,
            and investigated and learned the reason of their banishment, which is the
            evil faith of the synod of Chalcedon, he chose for himself like the great Moses
            to undergo affliction with his brothers, and not for a short time take his
            <pb n="686"/><pb n="484"/>pleasure<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n484-1"/> among the evil impieties of Chalcedon. And so he spoke much
            with the king and made entreaty to him with regard to the peace of the
            churches, and with regard to summoning his brothers, and, when no attention 
            was paid to him, he took his pall and laid it on the altar before the
            king himself and departed, while he also wrote letters to the two patriarchs,
            as they also composed synodical letters to him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n484-2"/>; and thus they made union
            with one another, and all the party of the believers was affected with great
            joy. But, when the queen saw the king's wrath against the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1592">Anthimus</persName> 
            on account of what he had done, and his great threatening, she took
            him and hid him in a chamber in her palace (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παλάτιον</foreign>), in order that men
            might not know what had befallen him, except only herself and two chamberlains 
            her accomplices, while even the king and everyone else might
            think that she had removed him and banished him entirely outside the city.
            And so for this reason the blessed man was in great peace, while he also
            performed his honourable labours and his great practices; because he had
            in fact been a monk before and he was so afterwards also, who never tasted
            bread, and also never drank wine, and had passed twenty-five years in this
            great abstinence, it having been in fact the whole time of the episcopate and of
            <pb n="687"/><pb n="485"/>his patriarchate; and thus he carried out the rule even after his expulsion
            also down to the end of his life, when he had also completed a space of ten years
            in hiding, until many thought that he was dead, until the time of the queen's
            death<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n485-1"/>, and so he was discovered and made known, and he was received by the
            king, while he also made peace with him, and held him in great honour,
            till the end of the blessed man's life, and he used to make entreaty
            with regard to the peace of the church. But the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/51">Severus</persName> had before
            these things been summoned by the king to the royal city on account of
            the peace of the church; and under great pressure from everyone he came,
            saying, <quote>Since it is everyone's will lo! I will go up, but it is impossible
               that anything whatever will be done by those who are in power</quote>; and so
            he went up, and passed two years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n485-2"/> a labouring and teaching. And, when
            he saw that his statement that nothing would be done was being accomplished, 
            he went back to the southern regions of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName>, constantly
            occupying his time in the desert in retreat and asceticism and studying the
            writings of the fathers, and perfectly carrying out great labour and an
            abstemious life. And, when he had completed a period of some years in
            <pb n="688"/><pb n="486"/>his banishment, he fell into a sickness; and afterwards they carried him from
            the desert to a city of Egypt called Ksoi<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-1"/>, and there he ended the course of
            his conflict (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>), and went to the Lord<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-2"/>.
         </p>
         <p>
            But the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName>, patriarch of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName>, also had been
            bravely contending in the conflict (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) of persecution for a considerable time,
            during all the lifetime of king <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName>, and did so after his death<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-3"/>, even
            to the present time, which is the year eight, hundred and seventy-seven<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-4"/>,
            (a new king having also succeeded in the same year, who is <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName>'s sister's
            son, who also promises with the help of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName> to bring about
            the peace of the church), having carried on a contest for about thirty years
            in exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) from place to place and from country to country. And<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-5"/> he
            also as well ended the course of his practices in the same year, in the same
            royal city, nine months after the death of the same <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName> the king<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-6"/>,
            nothing whatever having been done in the matter of the union of the church.
            And he completed thirty-one years and a half<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n486-7"/> in the conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) of
            <pb n="689"/><pb n="487"/>persecution and exile (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) from place to place, having also gained distinction 
            and renown all over the commonwealth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>) of us <persName>Romans</persName>, and he
            went in heroic fashion to the Lord. A period of some years therefore
            after the death of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/51">Severus</persName> the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1463">Sergius</persName> succeeded him in
            orthodoxy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθοδοξία</foreign>)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n487-1"/>, who was by his birth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) a man of Thella<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n487-2"/>, a learned
            and well-read mam, and among men renovned and well-known and honoured,
            and as regards God devout and given to fasting and a Nazirite, and a keeper
            of vigils, and a lover of quietude, and of reading the Scriptures and the
            exposition of the fathers, so that he was skilful in his speech, and a man of
            understanding.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n487-3"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            This man therefore, having attained ordination (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>) to the patriarchate 
            while in the royal city, and presided over the church, teaching and
            comforting and edifying and establishing everyone in the truth for three
            years after he had received the right hand of the high-priesthood of Antioch,
            ended his course, and was carried from the life here to our Lord in the same
            royal city. After three years from this man's decease a certain <persName>Alexandrine</persName>
            whose name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1977">Paul</persName> attained the high-priesthood of the same see, that is
            <pb n="690"/><pb n="488"/>outside in banishment; who also down to the present day after king <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName>'s
            death is in the body with archbishop <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/784">Theodosius</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n488-1"/>
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of the five blessed patriarchs who distinguished themselves in exile
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>) in the time of the persecution is ended.
