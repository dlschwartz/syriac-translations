         <head>Next the Thirty-Third History, of a Blessed Man Whose Name Was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1769">Hala</persName>
            the Zealous From the <placeName>Monastery</placeName> Called That of the <persName>Edessenes</persName>.</head>
         <p>
            This excellent blessed man therefore was thus called by a name which was
            also completely fulfilled in him, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1769">Hala</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n390-1"></ptr> the zealous, a man who was in truth
            zealous and humble and ascetic and a teacher, and perfect in all the practices
            of religion. Now this blessed man lived in one of the convents of the <persName>Amidenes</persName>
            <pb n="593"/><pb n="391"/>which is called that of the <persName>Edessenes</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n391-1"></ptr>; and I was also in intercourse with him
            for a space of some years, and during the days of my association with him I
            was with my whole soul thoroughly amazed at his keen zeal and his strenuous 
            course of life, and his constant energy and his vigilance in every
            good work, and (that we may use an expression which sums up all) in the
            fervour of his love toward God, and his humility and his zeal that imitated
            that high one who by his humility taught the pattern (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπος</foreign>) of it to his
            disciples. This zealous man therefore from the very beginning of his
            training chose for himself to perform all the menial tasks required for the
            needs of his convent, and besides this he resolved not to see a stranger enter
            the convent without associating himself in careful attention to his wants;
            and thenceforth he was constantly engaged in this pursuit all the day,
            being like a trader with many classes of merchandise, so that, although his
            trade fail in one, he can spend money on another, that an opportunity may
            be found for profit to come in, in that he never saw a poor man come to the
            gate of his convent without imparting to his necessity if only some small
            thing, or yet seeing a poor sick<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n391-2"></ptr> man without associating himself in careful
            <pb n="594"/><pb n="392"/>attention to his needs. So therefore one might see that this saint never
            ceased bringing in profit, and every day the business of the spiritual trade
            was never lacking to him, were it from strangers or from needy persons,
            or from sick persons lying outside and without consolation from any quarter.
            And besides these things he was constant in sweeping and washing the
            latrines (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σελλίας</foreign>?) of the momastery every day, and sweeping the whole
            <placeName>monastery</placeName> and brushing away the ashes. And, when the time came when
            he knew that the servitors<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n392-1"></ptr> had put a cauldron on the fire to cook the dish
            and had cleansed the herbs, he would go and sweep out the scullery,
            and take it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n392-2"></ptr> outside; and after taking it outside he would sit down and
            collect the scouring, down to a little leaf only about a finger long that had
            an animal in it, and he would wash it, and he would go in and beg of
            the servitors, and they would give him a pot, and he would set it on the fire;
            and further he would make entreaty of the steward, and he would give him
            a little oil, and he would cook that rejected portion in such a way that a
            man would be attracted by the mere smell of it, and that he would leave the
            choicest portion, and eat of it; and he would go and ask for a little bread,
            <pb n="595"/><pb n="393"/>and wine if any was to be had, and so he would take it out to the sick and
            afflicted and needy persons lying by the gate. And on a day when the
            servitors had no herbs he himself, in order not to trouble the gardeners,
            would go outside or go into the garden, and he would pick a wild herb that was
            of no use and bring it and make a dish and lentils<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n393-1"></ptr> and take it out to the
            poor people. And again, when he was sitting at table, he had made a basket
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σπυρίδα</foreign>) and a jar, and it was placed by him; and the greater part of what
            came to him he would put there, while he was also the cause of others
            imitating him and themselves also putting their cups into his jar and their
            portions into his basket (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σπυρίδα</foreign>); and he would take them secretly and carry
            them out to the needy persons, and thus he would relieve many souls, and
            they would bless him out of the whole of a perfect heart, and pray for him.
            And so he was constant in following this course day and night, holding no
            conversation with men, except if it was needed for the purposes of his service;
            but, when he was going out and when he was coming in, a psalm never
            departed from his mouth; and, even if he was speaking to someone,
            <pb n="596"/><pb n="394"/>one word and the next the man would see his lips move.
            And, if he ever had a moment during which he was resting from the service of the saints,
            he had recourse to the Scriptures, so that, if a night and a day was devoted
            to his reading without interruption, it was not enough to satisfy him with
            reading; for he was very erudite in the Scriptures and in doctrinal (?)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n394-1"></ptr> reading. 
            And he had a band of disciples; and at the conclusion of nocturns
            he would take his disciples, and would go to the refectory, or wherever it might
            be, and so they would read and recite the service till daybreak; and at
            daybreak he would eagerly betake himself to his ministration, going out
            several times although he had nothing to take out, and visiting the poor
            people lying at the gate before the time, and consoling and comforting
            them; and so all the needy and strangers used to look out for the sight of
            him, because that alone was enough to console them. But, as soon as they
            were seated at the tables, he would rise and pretend to laugh 'as to how
            he alone was to satisfy his need (?)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n394-2"></ptr> saying, <quote>Who has anything to give
               <pb n="597"/><pb n="395"/>to my Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>? Is there anyone who has a morsel for the fledglings of
               my Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>?</quote>, and he would make many even secretly take and give
            him something, so much so that some of those in authority were filled with
            resentment against him, saying, <quote>We have one gate set up, that we may
               together look after everyone. Why do you go outside?</quote> But he would
            listen and kept silence, or laughed with the man whoever he might
            be, saying, <quote>Forgive me, sir. I went out and saw these brothers of Lazarus.
               I went out and looked at the fledglings, and they are in want of a morsel
               of food</quote>. And so he was at last assailed by reproaches from all sides, but
            especially from the steward, since he used to trouble him greatly and beyond
            measure, so that, if they assisted him, the steward had no bread or wine,
            and the servitors no cooked food that reached mealtime without having
            gone out to the gate. And accordingly they heaped indignation and abuse
            upon him, and threw his cups and his plates to the ground. And he on his
            side would be in no way angry or wrathful or annoyed and would say,
            <quote>Why is it necessary that I should be abused?</quote> But sometimes too one
            of the servitors or the steward would be vexed, and they would show indig<pb n="598"/><pb n="396"/>nation 
            against him; and he on his side would thus drink in everything and
            put up with it, and laugh, so that his very patience would shame the man
            whoever he might be; and he would by no means depart till he had supplied
            his need from him, saying, <quote>I am grieved for my Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>, because he is
               hungry and has no quarter whence to get food; otherwise I should not be
               troubling you</quote>. And so he would receive it, and then depart. And thus
            he would intently and eagerly look after the poor and the sick without
            remission and without lassitude. And strangers who came in he would
            receive inside and would refresh and wash and anoint them and would lay
            their rugs besides all the other attentions, and they would lie down. And
            he himself would after a short rest for his body go and stand all night in a
            corner (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>) and recite the service and take their clothes and give them
            changes, and would scald and wash and darn and repair them, and so he
            would give them to them; and for this reason they used to call him 'Mar
            so-and-so the zealous. But after a period of some years during which the
            blessed man had been devoting himself to this great ministration, there
            came the persecution which disturbed everyone<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n396-1"></ptr>, and the convents removed
            <pb n="599"/><pb n="397"/>after all their property had been taken from them, and the rest<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-1"></ptr> stored in
            certain places; and they no longer had an abundance of the things which
            their needs required in everything. And the blessed man was much distressed at 
            this, because he possessed no changes of clothes for the strangers
            nor rugs; and he would disregard the fact that they were themselves in
            distress, and vex himself over the strangers; and accordingly he would
            contrive to obtain some worn-out old coats, and wash and darn them; and
            he would go out to the dungheaps and pay no attention to the jeers both of
            those inside and of those outside, and thus he would collect rags and flocks
            of wool, and would bring them and washt hem, and cut them up, and make
            cushions and fasten them together and lay them out; and when a stranger
            came he would dismiss him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-2"></ptr> and lay a rug for him and make him lie down.
            And so he found this method of carrying out his own employment, not giving
            up this strenuous pursuit in peace or in persecution, in the city or in exile
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>). After a time he had a brother<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-3"></ptr>, and he continued pressing him to
            go and pray at Ephesus; and he for his part was unwilling to do so, and his
            brother by urging him induced him to set out and go. And, since he was
            <pb n="600"/><pb n="398"/>weak<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n398-1"></ptr> from the feebleness caused by asceticism and moreover from the
            approach of old age, he fell into a serious illness for a long time, and
            therefore, inasmuch as some blessed men among the members of their <placeName>monastery</placeName> 
            were in the royal city, they<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n398-2"></ptr> went up thither in order to take the old
            man, and so he entered the community gathered together at that time by
            the queen who<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n398-3"></ptr> had been gathering together persecuted men from all quarters
            and looking after them, in that they had been placed by her in the palace
            (<foreign>παλάτιον</foreign>) called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2793">Hormisda</placeName>, where many distressed and poor persons and
            strangers lay by the gate night and day<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n398-4"></ptr>. But the blessed man, when he
            saw these, and an opening had been found for him also to give, thenceforth
            like a poor man who loses one of his great possessions, and decides in his
            mind that it will never be found again, and suddenly sees it and is astonished
            and glad, so was it with this blessed man also<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n398-5"></ptr>, while he thenceforth doubled
            the earlier work, first by the leavings that he got from everyone and by his
            own portions (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μοίρας</foreign>), and afterwards by the persistent effrontery (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χρώμα</foreign>)
            with which he would ask everyone after they had been showing resentment
            and indignation against him and saying: <quote>Mar so-and-so the zealous</quote>,
            and so he would perfectly carry out all the ministration to the needy with
            <pb n="601"/><pb n="399"/>superfluity, washing away the excrement of all that community and bringing
            them water, though he held the rank of a presbyter. And, while it was
            said there as it had been said before that he was a lover of vain glory and
            acted on account of men, he alone as if unaware of it sought that one object,
            to relieve persons in trouble, till everyone was astonished at him and they
            gave thanks to God, to whom be glory and honour and worship to the
            Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit now and always and for ever
            and ever Amen and Amen!
