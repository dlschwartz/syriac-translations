            When therefore I consider the degeneracy of our times and the confusion 
            of our days, I marvel greatly to think how it is that the prophetic, that
            is divine, saying does not rise into our mind, which says in a voice of
            thunder to our error, <quote>Lo! the righteous hath perished and there is none
               that taketh it to his heart, and saintly men are gathered and no heed is
               given</quote><note></note>. If we truly consider this, it has received accomplishment in our
            times, since all the great pillars whom we have seen, who by means of their
            continual supplication and petition bore up the tottering house of the world,
            have been gathered and passed from the confusions of this life, and those
            again whose great modes of life and mighty labours had been laid like huge
            base-stones at the foundations of the world have been collected and removed
            from among us as it is written <quote>and there is none that heedeth</quote><note></note>. For this
            <pb n="249"/><pb n="249"/>reason the whole habitable world of men has been shaken and tottered and
            its structure has been loosened; and it has so to speak already begun to
            fall; and there is none who takes note of these things and lays them to his
            heart, in order that the passage of sacred song may be fulfilled upon us
            which says, <quote>The Lord looked out from heaven upon men, to see if there
               were any man that was understanding and sought God, and all had together
               gone astray and become reprobate, and there was not even one who was
               doing what is good</quote><note></note>. For, having taken upon ourselves to trace, even if
            obscurely, a picture of the marvellous beauties of the saints whom I met in
            the times of my boyhood and leave it for the general benefit, if only to this
            remnant who have been left in our days, I am reduced to marvelling greatly
            in my thoughts how it is that all these marvellous and giant-like men have
            been collected like clear pure wine, and the world has been reduced to
            disgusting dregs turbid with evil matter, and we lay not these things to
            our heart.

            Once, when we were in the holy convent adjoining the city of Amida,
            that is that which is called the convent of the holy Mar John, as has been
            recorded by us in one of the foregoing histories’, since all these convents
            <pb n="250"/><pb n="250"/>surpassed everyone in devotion to hospitality, and were fervent in love
            toward their brothers, therefore on account of the report of their open-handedness 
            men used to repair from all quarters to the convents round the
            city, because their zeal was in truth kindled by the love of God, so that
            they did not in the case of any one of their brothers who came to them hold
            him to be merely a man of flesh, but through a mean and poor body he appeared 
            in their eyes as God himself who became flesh, and so they were eager
            to serve and refresh and wash and honour as it were Jesus Christ, that everyone
            might share in anything that might result through the blessing of the man
            whoever he were; and great and small were alike so devoted that, if a
            stranger were in one of these convents a year and two years and ten years
            and twenty and all the days of his life, there was no one who would open
            his mouth and in any way give him to understand that he was not as one
            of the old inmates; and so in the matter of clothing and in the whole supply
            of necessities he was brought forward with the priests and before the whole
            of the brotherhood; things which are objects of great admiration even down
            to the present time. While they were showing fervour in these things every
            day, one day a certain old man, poor and a stranger, came to the convent
            <pb n="251"/><pb n="251"/>in which I myself was; and, when he had been questioned with regard to
            the faith and made a defence, and had come in at the hour of vespers at the
            end of the service, they required him according to the custom (vouos) which
            they followed to sit at the seniors' table, that is the archimandrite's;
            and he on hearing this fell on his face in entreaty, saying: <quote>Excuse
               me, my fathers, for Christ's sake; because I am a poor man, and of this I am
               not worthy</quote>. But he was a man with sparse hair and long beard; and so
            many with the archimandrite himself among them rose to seat him at that
            table; and he with his face cleaving to the ground entreated: <quote>Do me a
               favour, sir, and allow me to sit at one of the other tables</quote>. And the archimandrite, 
            seeing his wish, said: <quote>Let him do what he likes</quote>; and so he
            consented to rise from the ground. And, as if by the grace of God, he
            directed his steps to the table at which I was sitting; and that though it was
            in the middle, and we were sitting with other tables on both sides of us.
            And we all rose and received that old man gladly and sat down. When a
            dish of cooked food had been set on the table, the head of the table was
            requesting him to pronounce the blessing; and he again continued making
            request saying, <quote>Excuse me</quote>; and he strongly urged him, and he would not
            agree; and we were astonished at the resistance which that old man made by
            <pb n="252"/><pb n="252"/>reason of his humility. And, every time that the blessed man reached out
            a spoon, his eye was furtively and gradually raised upward, and his lips
            moved, as if he were making a little sign; and thus regularly, whenever a
            morsel of food entered his mouth, a sign of thanksgiving came up from his
            heart by the muttering of his lips and the motion of his eyes. And, when
            the order was given by the archimandrite that the wine and water should
            go round (since this was the custom (vópos) that the wine and water should
            go round three times a week besides the first day of the week<note></note>), and,
            when the steward came and the old man received one cup like everyone
            else, since it was diluted with cold water, and one cup each only would
            be rapidly carried round and collected, and everyone pronounced a blessing
            and drank, and deposited the cup in its place, yet the blessed man would
            drink a sip at a time as if it were hot and one could not drink, and he could
            not be induced to drink one sip together with the next, but this is how he
            divided that cup, into as many sips as the times that it pleased him to
            offer praise over it; and, though it was a small cup, he divided it into
            more than a hundred sips. When the head of the table saw it, he
            said: <quote>Perhaps the old man would like to drink it with hot water, and
               <pb n="253"/><pb n="253"/>for this reason he was afraid of the cold</quote>; and he said to him: <quote>Do
                  you wish us to bring you hot water, our father?</quote>. He says, <quote>No,
                     excuse me. Whether it is cold or hot, this is my habit, to drink a little at a
                     time</quote>. When we were sitting, we asked the old man, <quote>Whence, sir, does
                        your holiness come?</quote>. But he, as if he were now occupied in eating,
            silently bent his head down toward us, and was silent; and again a second
            and a third time; and then at last he made this answer: <quote>Excuse me, my
               fathers, I am hungry and need to eat</quote>. And then we understood the blessed
            man's intention, and left him alone. And, when we had eaten and the
            old man was looking down and privily signalling upward, when we had
            spoken with him once and twice and thrice, and had asked him <quote>Whence
               are you?</quote>, his tears suddenly gushed out; and when he had put force upon
            himself to refrain and could not, he bowed his face down upon his knees,
            and covered his head; and so he with difficulty constrained himself, and
            stayed his sobs. And so we rose from the table, the old man standing in
            the midst with his head covered; and, when we had offered praise over the
            tables, and the old man had been washed according to custom (vópos), a rug
            was prepared for him in the chapel. And when he saw it he continued
            making request and saying, <quote>Because I am feeble and weary, and cannot
               <pb n="254"/><pb n="254"/>rise for service, for God's sake lay the bed for me outside in some corner
               (ye)yte)</quote>. Then, lest he should really be troubled by the service, they laid
            it for him as he asked. And, as there were some blessed men who were
            eager to investigate such things, they observed the old man in order to
            discover his intention. But he immediately fell upon his rug as if he had fallen
            asleep; and, when everyone's voice had ceased and they had been gathered
            to their beds, the blessed man turned upon his face on his rug, and he knelt
            and began to weep, from the evening right on till the nocturns bell, not being
            aware that anyone was aware of what he was doing, though those who were
            observing him had become weary and been sunk in sleep two and three
            times, and they were astounded to find that saint thus engaged down to
            the bell; but, when the bellman sounded the bell, he covered himself like
            an infirm man and lay down, until the end of the service; and then the
            same again until the morning, though not as he had done in the evening,
            but with precautions against those who were looking after the land (?)
            after service<note></note> and against those who were learning the Psalms. But in the
            morning he continued requesting to be dismissed and go; and the archi<pb n="255"/><pb n="255"/>mandrite
            would not let him, saying, <quote>Rest, our father, for five days and
               bless us, and then you shall go</quote>. And the old man, having been detained,
            went out into the garden to walk; and I, having learned these things about
            him from those who had been watching him, went out after him; and he
            saw me, and stopped. And I, beginning to enter into conversation with
            him, said to him: <quote>Wherefore, our father, did you conceal from us what
               kind of man you are, and from what convent you come?</quote>. But on his side
            his tears at once gushed forth again, and he was silent. But I said to him:
            <quote>If you are a Christian and Christ's bondman, I will not let you depart,
               unless you have informed me wherefore last evening and now you wept at
               this question. I have presumed, if you are God's bondman, to adjure you
               by him whom you serve, inform me about this and also about your modes
               of life for the sake of my soul's salvation</quote>. But the blessed man was
            annoyed and indignant, saying: <quote>For such an adjuration there was no
               need</quote>. And I on my side said: <quote>I made an adjuration that I might profit,
                  while you do not lose</quote>. Then the old man laid an injunction upon me with
            an oath that, until three years had passed, no word should come out of my
            mouth of what he would say to me<!--</quote> I cannot figure out what quote is closed here. -->; and he said: <quote>I, my son, have to-day 
               spent thirty years in this discipline; and during these years God will
               <pb n="256"/><pb n="256"/>not judge me for having opened my mouth over food which is derived
               from God's gift without stretching my thoughts to give praise for his bounty.
               I hope in his name that I shall not be condemned for having stretched forth
               my hand to my mouth without every time that I stretched it forth similarly
               stretching forth my tongue to praise and my mind to prayer on behalf of
               those who labour and sweat and toil to supply my need. I shall not be
               despised by the Giver of our good things for having put a vessel to my
               lips to drink water or wine, and drunk two consecutive sips without giving
               thanks to the Creator of it and interceding for those who have extended to me
               a share in their gift. And after these things last evening you were urging
               me to neglect such rendering of thanks to my Benefactor as my little strength
               is able to perform, and engage in vain talk. Or know you not that it was
               God's bounty that we were eating, with the sins of men' moreover that
               stain us? And how can it be, my son, that God will not be angry with
               us and deliver us to the judgment of torments when we eat his bounty
               and instead of rendering thanks engage in frivolous talk, and further,
               instead of prayers for the men the sweat of whose labour we are eating,
               <pb n="257"/><pb n="257"/>that' we should sit and enjoy ourselves in idle talk? And, because you
               adjured me by God, lo! these are the reasons for which last evening and now
               my sobs came up, since I said: <quote>How then (Špa) can the heart of a man
                  who is fed by God's bounty and mens' sin not tremble to emit words in
                  any other kind of conversation beyond that of thanks and prayer on behalf
                  of the needy and remembrance of those who are working and suffering
                  hardship and distress and want and need, while he is sitting thus without
                  care and without fear, and concerning himself with frivolous stories?</quote></quote>. I on
            hearing these things from that old man did the only thing that was proper
            for me to do, I bowed my face to the ground, marvelling at this extraordinary
            man and fixing my gaze on him, and further also too how<note></note> in the evening at
            table he would not consent to take even two sips only together. And such
            is our presumptuous impudence that I thought to myself while I was standing, 
            <quote>This man is a solitary, and further also he is his own master, and
               there is none to command him, and it is easy for him; and moreover neither
               is he pressed by matters of the obligation of domestic business; and therefore 
               he can observe this amazing canon (xxvóv). But how are we able to
               <pb n="258"/><pb n="258"/>do so?</quote>. But, while I on my part was secretly tracing these things in my
            thoughts, that spiritual man openly told me them all as if he had written
            out my thought and come to know it, saying: <quote>I have come to know what
               the evil one has caused to creep into your mind, in order to deprive you of
               profit</quote>, while he repeated everything to me as I had thought it. And then,
            when not only fear but astonishment also as well fell upon me, I confessed
            that that was what I had thought. But he sighed the more, saying: <quote>On
               account of these things, my son, Christianity has been corrupted, and the
               ordinances of religion have been thrown into confusion. If you are sitting
               at table, and enjoying the gifts of the Giver, how can you bring in affairs
               of business and cheat God's kindness of its due for the sake of his gifts?
               Or is not then (öpx) the day sufficient for you for your business with its hours
               and its moments, but at the moment at which one business only is required,
               thanksgiving, are you on your part giving attention to stories? (and would
               they were matters of business as you say; but they are actually detriments,
               and not matters of business) and all the more since it is indeed no trouble
               to you, since, while the outer man is feeding on his own food, it is easy, if
               you wish, for the hidden man to nourish himself with his, unless conversa<pb n="259"/><pb n="259"/>tion 
               be unfairly brought in and cheat him of his due</quote>. When the holy old
            man had spoken all these words, I began to request him to explain his other
            modes of life to me. Then he cut me short, saying: <quote>On one point on
               which you begged and pressed and adjured me you have heard me speak.
               Take a short answer. If you repeat another word to me, I will not eat
               bread within twenty miles of this city. But go and beware, and observe
               your promise, and pray for me</quote>. And, understanding these things, that
            it was on account of the fear of robbers that the spiritual merchant feared
            to show his riches, I fell down before him and besought him to forgive me.
            And thus he departed and went away after two days, without having consented 
            to tell us his name or anything about the other modes of life. And
            I have remained down to the present time lost in admiration of the man of
            God at all seasons.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of one of the saints who would not consent to state his name
            is ended.
