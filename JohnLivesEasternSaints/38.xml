         <head>Next the Thirty-Eighth History, of the Excellent Blessed Man the Holy
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1533">Aaron</persName> the Presbyter, and the Rest of the Presbyters and Deacons
            Who Were Afterwards Laid in the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2816">Sepulchre</placeName> That Was Built by The 
            Blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1875">Mare</persName></head>
         <p>
            This excellent blessed man therefore <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1533">Aaron</persName> the presbyter was by his
            birth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) from the country of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2743">Armenia</placeName>; but from his childhood he had left
            <pb n="642"/><pb n="440"/>his country and had also made himself alien to his kin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) and his acquaintances, 
            and he chose for himself to pass the days of his life in a monastic
            convent in retreat and religion, from the early age of his youth. And besides
            the fact that simplicity and humility were also implanted in him by his nature,
            since he had devoted himself to religion, he chose for himself marvellous
            practices of excellence, and taught himself meekness and obedience, and
            acquired true love, having bound himself under the yoke of labours, vigils
            and fasts and constant prayers without wearying; and, even as he resembled
            his namesake <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1533">Aaron</persName> in name and in character, so, when he had attained to
            the order of the priesthood, he would recite the service yet more with all
            integrity and devoutness with fear and many tears, after he had at first for a
            long time refused to perform the service, contending and saying, <quote>I am not
               worthy to approach God's holy altar</quote>; and, when we and others had been
            insistently demanding of him to perform the service of the priesthood, in
            order that he might not transgress against the rule of obedience, he would
            go through this with sorrow and fear, while he also used to subdue his body
            and bring it into subjection<note></note> by the bodily labours of agriculture, in the
            vineyard and the garden, and the reception of strangers, and all the other
            tasks inside the monastery, so much so that late in the evening when he
            <pb n="643"/><pb n="441"/>came of necessity to rest his body, he could scarcely turn his body round,
            from weariness and also from the labour of standing at the service. But sometimes 
            he would stand on a standing-post<note></note> at night, and sometimes he would
            sit on a chair (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θρόνος</foreign>), so that he completely refrained from bed and rug, or to
            give rest to his body so as to lie upon his side, until he was smitten by sore
            diseases and advanced old age, and then he was forced to lie upon a rug laid
            on a plank, while even so he in no way gave up the great purpose of spiritual
            labours. And during all the period of thirty years that we dwelt together,
            some in the eastern countries, and some, viz. most of them, in the
            western in the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/586">royal city</placeName>, and further in many persecutions, it was never
            seen that this strenuous worker showed negligence in the tilling of <persName>Christ</persName>'s
            vineyard from the morning of the beginning of his life down to the evening.
            of the end of his days, nor, when he fell into extreme old age and a combination 
            of diseases, did he shrink from divine labours. Once he fell under
            the severe pain of a gangrene that was formed in his loins; and in this way
            he bore this distress with great devoutness, until his loin was eaten up, and
            was cut away and vanished down to the root of it, and his trouble began to
            <pb n="644"/><pb n="442"/>pass inside him. And we, seeing him distressed by a sore disease and
            grievously lacerated in secret, would ask of him to tell us what his trouble
            was; and he, until his affliction became intense, stoutly endured, being
            constant in prayer and filling his mouth with thanksgiving and the praise of
            God. But at last when the passing of water from him was stopped he was
            forced, and so he consented to reveal and make known his trouble, when the
            whole of his loin was found to have been eaten away and consumed, so that
            the physicians contrived to make a tube of lead and place it to pass his
            water, while they also applied plasters and drugs to him. And so the ulcer
            was healed; and after the testing of this trial he lived yet eighteen years,
            giving thanks to God; and the leaden tube was also in position for the purpose
            of passing his water. And so, after we had together through God's help in
            association with some of our other brethren set up this monastic place, he
            attained to an admirable and righteous ending, on a day in the month of the
            1st Theshrin, on the twenty-second of it, in the year eight<note></note> hundred and
            seventy-two; and he was laid in the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2816">sepulchre</placeName> that was built by the blessed
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1875">Mare</persName>. And these things we have recorded in few words for a remembrance
            <pb n="645"/><pb n="443"/>and memorial of the strenuous worker of <persName>Christ</persName>, about the matters connected
            with his beautiful mode of life of which we are witnesses.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of the excellent blessed man <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1533">Aaron</persName> the presbyter is ended.
