         <head>Next the Eleventh History, of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1771">Harfat</persName> the Chorepiscopus From the Country of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2758">Anzetene</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n158-1"></ptr></head>
         <p>
            This blessed man belonged to a distinguished, great, and rich family
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>); and, when all the members of his family (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>), his parents included,
            had died, the whole household and the wealth were left in this man's hands,
            <pb n="159"/><pb n="159"/>and also in the hands of another kinsman older than he; and he practised
            deceit and was a man of artful tricks and a dogjoh like <persName>Nabal</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n159-1"></ptr>; and he was
            moreover engaged in the affairs of the <foreign>praetoriani</foreign><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n159-2"></ptr>. But this virtuous <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1771">Harfat</persName>
            lived in pure and simple fashion and spent a guileless life within the house like
            <persName>Jacob</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n159-3"></ptr>, having committed the whole management of it to that kinsman of
            his; and he himself as far as he could gave his attention to the needy and
            to the salvation of his soul, while his soul was indeed vexed and he was
            distressed at the multitude of male and female slaves, and hired servants
            and outsiders, and the other luxuries of the household; and he would think
            in himself, and say: <quote>Wherefore do I need all this parade, while debtors go
               on bringing interest and bonds continue to be exacted every day?</quote>; but
            the blessed man was occupied with thoughts that were adverse to these
            things. After a little time the bishop of a place called <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2744">Arsamosata</placeName> died,
            and they came to make the blessed man bishop, that is in the Chalcedonian
            communion<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n159-4"></ptr>; but he shrank from this. When they saw that this man had
            absolutely refused, under the inducement of riches and high position they
            <pb n="160"/><pb n="160"/>seized <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3764">his kinsman</rs>, a layman, and made him bishop; and, when he had
            become bishop, the blessed man continually required of him to divide the
            estate; in order that he himself might distribute his share (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέρος</foreign>) among the
            needy, and he would not agree, saying, <quote>While I live, it shall not be
               divided</quote>. Now they had about five thousand <foreign>denarii</foreign>, besides all the rest of
            the estate, and, when that man had gone to his see, the blessed man
            distributed as much as he could among the needy, and committed the rest
            to our Lord, saying, <quote>Lord, thou knowest the readiness of my mind, and
               the fact moreover that neither hast thou commanded me to continue in
               contention and strife. llenceforth, Lord, dispose thou my wretched soul
               to live before thee according to thy will</quote>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Then the blessed man left the house and the office of the chorepiscopate
            which he had held for some years, and withdrew to a convent of the solitary
            life. And, because he was very simple, and thought that this was the
            consummation of perfection, he went and made great heavy irons and put
            them upon himself, that is on his neck and on his hands and on his feet,
            <pb n="161"/><pb n="161"/>two on each. And he went and settled on a certain mountain about three
            miles from the cultivated land, and he did not take or receive any part
            whatever of his property, but he would sit thus on that mountain, mourning
            and weeping and groaning for the rest of life which had been spent and had
            passed from him in vain. But, when he had stayed a considerable time in
            these mountains, in consequence of the quantity of snow and the severity of
            the cold the blessed man suffered great distress and was brought to the
            point of death. Then a certain believing lady made a hut for him, and in it
            he would sit and weep night and day, though many said to him, <quote>What is the
               cause of this weeping of yours that is thus incessant and not for a limited
               season? The man who weeps out of sorrow for his sins has seasons.
               Why do you thus weep like a baby over your eating and your sitting down
               and your rising up?</quote> But, when he heard these words, the blessed man's
            sobs would rose all the more, and his very speech to the man who was
            addressing him was mingled with weeping, while he expressed himself
            saying, <quote>Who, my sons, will not weep, when he sees a decayed and putrid
               <pb n="162"/><pb n="162"/>corpse thrown down in his house? Who will not mourn for the sons of
               youth fair to behold and of attractive age, when he sees that death has
               corrupted their features, and they have become mire and putrescence and
               loathsome worms in place of the attractive beauty of childhood? And, if
               men weep for these with sobs, how shall I not now wail bitterly for my
               wretched soul that was fashioned in the likeness of angels with all beauties,
               and lo! is dead in sin and decayed through evil deeds and cast down in the
               house of the body, and in which corrupt and abominable thoughts creep about
               like worms? How shall I not weep for my moments that have been spent
               by me in vain without my perceiving it? How shall I not mourn for my
               days that I have uselessly wasted one by one without knowing it? And now
               lo! the terrible sentence of torment is prepared for me, which the workers of
               iniquity deserve<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n162-1"></ptr>. For this reason I ought not only to weep, but also to
               mourn and wail like a jackal, and increase mourning as of a jackal's whelp
               for my life that has been spent, for my moments that have been consumed,
               for my years that have been lost, for my time that has been wasted, for my
               <pb n="163"/><pb n="163"/>soul that is dead in sin, for my body that has been made a grave during my
               life, for my soul that is dead in evil deeds, for the judgment that has arrived,
               for the end of life that has overtaken me, for the terrible sentence of justice,
               for the moment when the command will go forth, <quote>He who hath not wedding-garments, 
                  let his hands and his feet be bound and let him be cast into outer
                  darkness</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n163-1"></ptr>. And for what reasons, pray, O men, do you advise me to cease
               crying woe upon my life at all moments?</quote> And thus this man used to cause
            all men to marvel and be amazed, until the report of his mortification and of
            his affliction penetrated to every place. And, when we heard these things,
            we made it our object to obtain a sight of this blessed man. And, having
            done this, we went and entered his presence; and so we found him in the
            same state, sitting in dejection, and in great infirmity on account of the
            labour and the abstinence, as well as from the weight of these irons. And,
            when we had enjoyed his society for a day and two days, and had gained
            freedom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παρρησία</foreign>) of speech in his presence, and continued saying to him
            <quote>Wherefore, O our father, have you burdened your body with the weight
               of all this iron?</quote>, he said to us, <quote>On account of my sins</quote>. And, when
            <pb n="164"/><pb n="164"/>we were on another occasion conversing with, him, we again said to him:
            <quote>What regulation commands this matter of the irons to be carried out?</quote>,
            and, <quote>If we seek to humble our body to the earth by labours of asceticism,
               cannot we humble it without irons?</quote>. After we had addressed many words
            to the blessed man, he continued to weep and sigh; and at last he said to us:
            <quote>And now, sir, what do you wish done?</quote>. And I, joking a little with him,
            said to him: <quote>We wish you to throw off these irons which are a useless
               burden, and lade yourself instead of them with the burden of labours
               performed with knowledge; and thus you will please God</quote>. But tbe blessed
            man was much annoyed at these words, saying, <quote>It were better for me that
               my head were removed and not these irons</quote>. And I turned upon him with
            the words: <quote>For what reason?</quote> But he in his simplicity said, <quote>On account
               of my sins, and on account of the stumbling-block put in men's way</quote>. But
            we, since we pitied the infirmity of his body, and wished to remove these
            irons from him, said to him: <quote>Lo! therefore see, our father, that the matter
               <pb n="165"/><pb n="165"/>of the irons is addressed only to men, but there is nothing in them that brings
               near to God; but I even fear lest they lead away from life; since God gave
               no commandment about irons. But, if we seek to conduct ourselves according
               to knowledge and fulfil God's commandments, we shall hear from him what
               he said, <quote>Learn of me for I am mild and lowly in my heart</quote>, and, <quote>Whoever
                  smiteth thee upon thy cheek</quote>; and first <quote>Thou shalt love the Lord thy
                     God</quote>; and again <quote>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</quote>; and again
               <quote>Whoever will take thy cloak</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n163-1"></ptr>, besides the other things which the Lord
               taught and commanded us in his preaching. If, our father, you wish to
               please the Lord, it is by these things and by the others that are like them
               that you will please; but by irons God will never be pleased; but they even
               become sources of detriment to the soul. For now, as you said, you are a
               sinner; and we or others who see you with irons hanging on you think to
               ourselves that you are a great and holy man, and a worker of miracles.
               If you are so, you do well in hanging irons on yourself</quote>. When the blessed
            man heard all these things, his heart trembled and he said: <quote>If it is so, and
               <pb n="166"/><pb n="166"/>they tend to cause loss, I do not desire to suffer loss; for as for me it is my
               earnest endeavour to amass gain, and not loss</quote>. And so he committed
            himself to our Lord, and to us; and by the aid of many strong men we took
            these irons off him; and thenceforth he subjugated himself by double labours
            in their place, insomuch that after seven years we returned to him, and we
            found him thus living a hard life, and thus he ended his days with great
            glory.
