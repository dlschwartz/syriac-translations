         <head>Next the Fifty-Second History, of Certain Great and Holy Persons Children of 
            Eminent Men of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>, Who Despised the World and All That Is in It and Lived a 
            Holy Life in It in Poverty of Spirit in an Assumed Garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>)</head>
         <p>
            It did not seem to be a right thing to withhold this spiritual traffic also
            <pb n="165"/><pb n="511"/>besides and the great abundance of massed profits which spring from many
            persons to all who are desirous of the good traffic that is concerned with
            their lives and rejoice in the double spiritual profits which will arise from
            the persons (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) whose marvellous likenesses we are about though
            obscurely to trace by means of our contemptible words, by no means stating
            more than what we received by report and accurately learned from <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3225">God's
            bondman</persName> who saw and was in close contact with these same holy persons
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) and learned the rest from them in secret and imparted it to me
            by repetition, who was a fellow-resident with us for eight years till the end
            of his life, who for seven years went out in quest of the same persons (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) 
            of whom he had been deprived and from whom he had been separated.
            This perfect saint therefore belonged to a distinguished family (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) from
            the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName> in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1452">Mesopotamia</placeName>, wearing the habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of a clergymnn,
            and his name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3225">John</persName>. This man therefore during the whole of the residence 
            with us in the royal city<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n511-1"/> we always saw shedding copious tears and
            sobbing, so that, when we questioned him closely as to the reason of these
            <pb n="166"/><pb n="512"/>things, and especially with adjurations, he would weep bitterly, saying,
            <quote>What have I to say to you? for I, unhappy man that I am, suffered a spiritual
               loss, and to-day it is now a space of seven years that I have been going out
               and going round the peoples and the countries and the cities, and I have not
               succeeded in finding it, insomuch that it was on this quest that I came to this
               royal city</quote>. When we questioned him as to that loss, he would tell us
            the story, weeping and saying, <quote>Lo! in the sight ok God I say, my brethren,
               that I will not lie to you in telling the astounding story of what I saw and
               heard in certain perfect persons and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n512-1"/> from them. When I was in the city
               of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName> nine years ago<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n512-2"/>, and was constantly devoting myself to reciting
               the service and to vigil in the holy church, I used to see a <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2121">young man of
                  handsome appearance</persName> as in the garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of a mime-actor (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>), and
               with him moreover a <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3021">young girl</persName> whose beauty cannot be portrayed and
               whose appearance was comely and marvellous accompanied him in the garb
               (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of a courtezan (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρνη</foreign>), and they used to go about the city in that
               assumed garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) in order to deceive the spectators, lest anyone should
               perceive and know what they were, and they used constantly to perform
               <pb n="167"/><pb n="513"/>drolleries (<foreign xml:lang="grc">παιγνίδια</foreign>) and buffooneries, being constantly in the courts of the
               church like strangers, jesting at the clergymen and everyone, and being
               boxed on their heads by everyone as mime-actors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>), while at all hours
               of the day a large number of people surrounded them, chiefly on account of
               their marvellous appearance, and the comeliness of their faces (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>),
               joking and playing with them, and giving them slaps (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κόσσους</foreign>) on their heads,
               but at nights men were not able to find out and learn where they slept, so
               that many of the froward men, having been by the appearance of the young
               woman's face (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) ardently smitten and kindled with the passion of
               desire for her, while they also made plans to fulfil their desire in the darkness 
               of night and commit fornication with her, wearied themselves and kept
               awake and watchful and went round all the streets of the city and its corners
               (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>) to find her, and they were not able to do so; so that many of the
               distinguished men, having been smitten with passion, and being ardently
               inflamed with desire for her, begged the governor (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ήγεμών</foreign>) of the city to
               arrest her and set her in the street, which he indeed did immediately, and
               he sent and seized her to force her to stand in the street, so that when the
               man dressed like a mime-actor (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>) who was with her saw it he wailed
               <pb n="168"/><pb n="514"/>with a loud voice, and ran crying <quote>She is my wife, and I do not wish her
                  to stand in the street</quote>. But a great and distinguished devout and God-fearing 
               woman whose name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3202">Cosmo</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n514-1"/> on learning it was distressed, and
               she seut and took her from the governor's (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ήγεμών</foreign>) men and brought her up
               to her house. And, when she also too saw her marvellous face (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) and
               that she was wearing the garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of a courtezan (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πόρνη</foreign>), she continued
               admonishing her, saying: <quote>Wherefore, my <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3021">daughter</persName>, whose person is like
                  a beautiful pearl, have you fallen into the mire of fornication, and wherefore
                  are you polluting and staining your soul and impairing your beauty?</quote>, so
               that, when she on her part heard these things, she continued weeping and
               saying : <quote>Yes, madam, pray for me that God may draw me out of the mire
                  of my sins</quote>.</quote>
         </p>
         <p>
            <quote>After these things they went back to their former habits, and that lady
               did not learn what they were. And, while much was being said about
               them</quote> (the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3225">John</persName> would say), <quote>and no one succeeded in discovering
                  or learning the resting-place where they slept at nights, I myself as if by the
                  grace of God discovered it by my reasonings, inasmuch as I reasoned <quote>These
                     <pb n="169"/><pb n="515"/>persons who in garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) appear to he mime-actors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>) are in actions
                     spiritual persons</quote>, and from that time I began to observe them, and at
                  evening time I posted myself behind them, keeping close opposite to them,
                  while they, in order that no one should observe them and find them out,
                  continued the whole evening until the whole city was being gathered in
                  going round many streets by a long course, going in by one street and
                  coming out by another, and crossing rough and dark places, so that I also
                  followed after them at a short distance, so that two or three hours of the
                  night<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n515-1"/> were already past, and so, after the city had become still, they directed
                  their course to the line of the wall, and mounted the wall, while I also was
                  stealthily mounting after them. And, keeping myself close to a pinnacle
                  of the wall, I stood up, and I saw that both placed themselves standing
                  with their faces toward the east, and stretched out their arms to heaven
                  prayer in the form of a cross, and after a time they fell upon their faces
                  in prayer, and they stood up and again fell upon their faces in prayer, and
                  they stood up again and fell down and they went through the same form for
                  <pb n="170"/><pb n="516"/>a long time, and afterwards they sat down to rest, and thus I on my part ran
                  and fell on my face before them, adjuring them by God the All-Ruler not
                  to hide from me the truth as to what and whence they were. And they
                  on their side were alarmed and very greatly annoyed, saying, <quote>Man, who
                     are you and what do you want? And why do you want to prove us here?
                     And what do you want to learn from mime-actors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>)?</quote> And, because
                  I recognised the trouble which their minds felt, as if they had already been
                  laid bare, I gave them a great and terrible oath, <quote>No men shall hear from my
                     mouth about you as long as you are in this city</quote>. Then they were a little
                  appeased, requiring at my hands that I should not be seen speaking
                  with them by day or honour them or greet them, and should not be
                  prevented from slapping (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κοσσίσαι</foreign>) them as mime-actors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>) as they said.
                  And I gave them this promise. Then that man begged that young woman,
                  saying to her, <quote>Now that this our brother has found us out, because perhaps
                     the Lord wished it so, since he himself also has regard to his life together
                     with his sister, for it is twenty-four years that they have been living together,
                     and he is supposed to have taken her to wife, but both have been preserved
                     <pb n="171"/><pb n="517"/>in the purity and holiness of virginity to the present time, therefore speak
                     with him, and be under no restraint</quote>. But I on hearing these things was
                  the more frightened and alarmed, and I knew that they were in truth great
                  spiritual persons and knowers of secrets. But the blessed woman answered
                  again, saying to him, <quote>Pardon me, my brother. The priority is yours you
                     speak</quote>. But he again enjoined her, saying, <quote>Speak with him, my sister,
                        without contention, and be under no restraint</quote>. And so the bondmaid of
                  Christ began with sighs and affliction to speak to me about the world and
                  about its deceitfulness, and about all its evil things and the destruction of
                  those who go astray in it, and again about its end and dissolution, and
                  about the future judgment, so that I and they spent all the hours of that
                  night in sobbing tears and with the word of life spoken by the same blessed
                  woman, for what proceeded from the mouth of that blessed woman was a
                  matter to cause awe-struck astonishment. Afterwards they dismissed me
                  to go down from that place, saying, <quote>Depart and go down, our brother, for
                     we also are going down while it is dark, lest anyone perceive or recognise
                     us</quote>. And so I begged them to allow me to go up to them by night without
                  <pb n="172"/><pb n="518"/>restraint; and, having strictly cautioned me, they gave me permission. And
                  so I went down from them, in fear and in great joy, as they too went down
                  to the court of the church, and when day broke they were to be seen acting
                  mimes before everyone. But on the second night I waited for the hour, and
                  went up again to them, and, having cast myself upon my face, I continued
                  entreating them not to conceal from me what they were, and what and of
                  what nature their service was, and what their names were and how the
                  names ran. They on their side say to me, <quote>Do you also give us your word
                     that you will keep truth to us to keep our matter secret, and not cause us
                     distress and give information about us, because we like being in this city which
                     is a city of Christians, and we on our part will thenceforth not hide anything
                     from you</quote>. And on my giving them my word as they required of me they
                  said to me: <quote>Know then first that our names are <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2121">Theophilus</persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3021">Maria</persName>, and
                     we are by our birth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) from <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName> the great, children of men of eminence 
                     in the city, and we were both only children of our parents; but how
                     it was that by God's help we came to adopt this garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) hear for your
                     edification and for God's glory. When I <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2121">Theophilus</persName> the sinner was a little lad
                     of about fifteen years, I was ordered by my father to take five horses and some
                     slaves, and go out to the village before daylight. And, when I on my side
                     <pb n="173"/><pb n="519"/>had risen during the night to go down to our stable (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στάβλον</foreign>) in which were
                     many horses to take some and go out as I had been ordered, and when I had
                     arrived at the door, I looked and saw alarming rays of light coming out from
                     the chinks of the door and from the windows; and, having seen it from a
                     distance and been frightened and thought that our stable (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στάβλον</foreign>) was on
                     fire, I cried out. And I ran and looked through the chinks of the door, and
                     I saw a poor man standing on the horses' dung on which he used to sleep
                     with his hands stretched out to heaven, and rays of light proceeding from
                     his mouth and from each of his fingers, and the whole building richly lighted.
                     And, having seen and marvelled, I then said to the slaves with me, <quote>Do
                        (you)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n519-1"/> see that glorious light?</quote> And they said <quote>We have not seen anything</quote>. 
                     And I cried to the stablemen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σταβλάριος</foreign>) to rise and open the door.
                     And, when that poor man heard my voice, he threw himself upon that
                     dung, and had already buried himself, since he was in fact naked, and was
                     clad in rags only, and he had begged the stablemen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σταβλάριος</foreign>) on account
                     of the severity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκη</foreign>) of the cold of winter that he might come in and bury
                     himself in the horses' dung, in order that he might warm himself in it and
                     <pb n="174"/><pb n="520"/>sleep. But, when he heard our voice, mine and that of the slaves, and threw
                     himself down and drew in his hands, then that great light was obscured,
                     and darkness fell over the whole building. And, the stablemen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σταβλάριος</foreign>)
                     having run and kindled torch-lights and opened the door, I went in and ran
                     and fell at that poor man's feet trembling and beseeching and adjuring him
                     by God who made heaven and earth and all that is in them to let me know
                     whence he was, and what he was, while he on his side continued repelling
                     me and saying: <quote>Sir, pardon me, for I am a miserable poor man, and on
                        account of the severity (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκη</foreign>) of the winter I had begged permission to
                        come in at evening time and sleep and warm myself in this dung; and from
                        a poor man of this kind what can you learn?</quote> And when I on my side had
                     thrown myself at his feet and was adjuring him, and they were all amazed
                     at me, while I swore to him <quote>I will not rise from this place and you shall
                        inform me of the truth</quote>, and when I continued to press him greatly and he
                     saw that I would not leave his feet he said to me, <quote>Dismiss your slaves and
                        let them withdraw and I will speak with you</quote>. And, when I had dismissed
                     the slaves and the stablemen (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σταβλάριος</foreign>) telling them to go outside, he began
                     <pb n="175"/><pb n="521"/>to say, <quote>What, my son, did you see in me that you were so insistent with
                        me? And I said to him, <quote>A vision of rays of fire proceeding from your
                           mouth while you were praying</quote>. He on his side said to me, <quote>It is not
                              my son, who am anything of this kind, but because God wishes for your
                              salvation and wishes to bestow this sight upon you it appeared to you in
                              this way</quote>. But, when I went on continuing to press him with terrible oaths
                        that I would not give any information or disclosure to men about him while
                        he lived, then he began to relate a story to me saying: <quote>Since God wished
                           to choose you, my son, that you may flee from the world and live a life
                           without care, listen. As for me, the sinner and poor man whom you see,
                           my name is <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3247">Procopius</persName>, and I am son of great and distinguished people of
                           <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/641">Rome</placeName>. And, when my parents betrothed a wife to me, and wished to hold
                           a marriage-feast for me according to the worldly custom, and when the
                           preparations had been made, I for my part left them and went on board
                           ship, and by the guidance of God I arrived in these eastern countries, having
                           taken into consideration the evils of the world and its distresses and temptations, 
                           and now lo! I have been as you see me for no small number of years.
                           And now, my son, hear from me myself the poor man, and know what is
                           in store for you. Lo! you are the only child of your parents, and they
                           betrothed a bride to you who is also the only child of her parents. Know
                           <pb n="176"/><pb n="522"/>therefore that during this year the parents of both of you will die, and both
                           the properties (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσίας</foreign>) will fall into your hands; and, if you wish to live a
                           religious life and without care and the ruin of sins which much real and
                           personal wealth brings to many, dispose of all your property (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσία</foreign>) and sell
                           it and give to the poor and needy, and free all your bondmen, and give them
                           presents to support and provide for them, and similarly dispose of the house
                           and the property (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσία</foreign>) also of the young woman who was betrothed to you,
                           since she will acquiesce in your desire in whatever you say to her, and so
                           take her and go out in an assumed garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) and in strange countries,
                           hiding the great profit of excellence which you are earning, lest it be
                           snatched from you, that thus you may live the spiritual life</quote>. But I for my
                        part promised to carry out all that he ordered, and I begged him not to
                        deprive me of the sight of him, and abandon me and depart. And the holy
                        blessed man of God <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3247">Procopius</persName> made me a promise, saying, <quote>This know,
                           that, as long as you do not show me the appearance (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) of any respect,
                           or show that you have any regard for me, and leave me as I am, that I may
                           sleep in this dung, and are not constantly speaking with me or approaching
                           <pb n="177"/><pb n="523"/>me before onlookers, you shall see me as long as you observe these things.
                           But, if you practise any of these things toward me, you will not see me
                           again in this life</quote>. And so I used to observe times, and make obeisance
                        to him in secret places or outside the city, and receive consolation from his
                        spiritual admonition, until in the same year the parents of both of us died,
                        and we did everything as that saint ordered, even as my spiritual sister
                        acquiesced in my purpose in everything, since she too received the privilege
                        of the prayer and the sight and the blessing and the admonition of that saint,
                        and we went out in pursuit of the life without care and have so continued
                        to the present time, while neither of us has been besmirched by carnal intercourse, 
                        and this has not been revealed to anyone, and no other except you
                        knows our secret, which we think has happened for your profit. And now
                        we ourselves say to you the words of our holy father <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3247">Procopius</persName>, that, as
                        long as you keep faith with us, and do not look upon us before men except
                        in the guise (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of mime-actors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μίμος</foreign>), under which we are concealing
                        our traffic, lo! we shall be in this city and you shall see us, but, if you show
                        any other behaviour toward us, know that you have been deprived of the
                        <pb n="178"/><pb n="524"/>sight of us in the body</quote>, which indeed happened</quote></quote><!-- The 2nd close quote not in Brooks but required by the sense -->. In this way therefore
            the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3225">John</persName> was repeating all these things in our presence with terrible
            oaths by God without addition and without diminution, while he wept with
            sobs and said: <quote>After I had been delighting myself in the conversation of
               the saints for the period of about one year, and they had been great in my
               eyes as angels of God, and I had not dared to make use of insult toward
               them as they desired, they left me and departed from the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName>, and
               I never again discovered where they went, and it is to-day seven years that
               I have been going out seeking them, and have not again been able even to
               hear news of them</quote>. We ourselves therefore from the descriptions of them
            and the time of their disappearance which he repeated before us, when we
            directed our steps to the desert of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715">Egypt</placeName><note></note>, gained the privilege of seeing
            them, and of passing a night with them<note></note> outside the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/200">Thella</placeName>Thella<note></note>, and we
            enjoyed their holy conversation, while that young woman also said to us
            <pb n="179"/><pb n="525"/>three times, <quote>Fear not for the Lord is with you wherever you go</quote>, and
            thus we departed from one another.

            The history of certain great and holy persons children of eminent men of
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>, who despised the world and all that is in it and lived a holy life in it in
            poverty of spirit in an assumed garb (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>), is finished.

            <note xml:id="n524-1">He seems to mean that he saw them before the above story was told him and from it identified them. His last visit to Egypt was in 541 (Introd., p. V), which would make the event fall while he was still in Amida, if he had already heard the narrative given 9 yrs. afterwards (p. 512). Moreover the ref. to the time he seems to imply that he saw them soon after they left Amida.</note>
            <note xml:id="n524-2">If this is true, it is strange that he tells their story secondhand, and I suspect that the statement is made in order that he may not appear to depart from the rule of not relating lives of persons not personally known to him, though he may well have seen a couple whom he supposed to be the heroes of the story.</note>
