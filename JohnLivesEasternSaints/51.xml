         <head>Next the Fifty-First History, of the Blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2032">Kashish</persName> Bishop of the Island of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1529">Chios</placeName>.</head>
         <p>
            Since therefore in one of the previous histories also we made mention of
            the subject of the history of the great blessed man of God our father <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2032">Kashish</persName>
            the bishop<note></note>, when he was indeed still in the life in the body with us, we did
            not think it right even after his decease also to withhold the treasure full of
            spiritual riches of his great modes of life and of his honoured labours. This
            saint therefore was by birth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) from a village called that of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2865">ʿAina da Frakha</placeName> 
            which is beyond <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2825">Nirba<note></note> d Škwš</placeName>, and, while he was still a little
            boy, he was called by God's grace, and left his kin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>) and his parents, and
            went out, and entered our holy convent of the house of Mar <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/74">John</persName> in the city
            of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName> and received instruction there, while we ourselves also besides were
            in the same convent at an early period of age; and we came to the convent at
            the same time when about fifteen years old; and thenceforth we were
            trained together in labour and in the reading of the holy Scriptures in
            brotherly fashion; insomuch that together we endured and supported thirty
            <pb n="160"/><pb n="506"/>years of chasing from one district to another with all our holy fathers and
            spiritual brothers, and the holy convents throughout the East; so that for
            such reasons we were led to the western districts on a long peregrination,
            while that saint did not cease running along the great road of righteousness,
            nor diminish the labour of his marvellous great practices; but at last he was
            seized by the keen impulse of the excellent life, so that in love of peregrination 
            and at a distance from acquaintances he extended his own travels to
            the remote countries of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2847">Thebais</placeName> and <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2673">Greece</placeName> and the whole of
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2797">Illyricum</placeName>, and even as far as <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/641">Rome</placeName> and the other countries; insomuch that he
            changed the monastic habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) for lay attire, in order that he might not
            on account of the habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) be venerated or honoured by any man, but
            as an ordinary poor man he went about everywhere among poor ordinary
            needy men; and consequently he suffered blows and distresses in a laborious, 
            distressing, severe, and hard life of peregrination, especially in consequence 
            of the fact that he had determined in himself not to receive charity
            from anyone and not to reap any enjoyment whatever from the labour
            of others, except from the work of his hands, for he used to make baskets
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σπυρίδα</foreign>) and pairs of bellows, and handsome tiaras (<foreign xml:lang="grc">καμελαυκία</foreign>)<note></note> of various
            <pb n="161"/><pb n="507"/>colours, which he had learned in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715">Egypt</placeName>. Thus wherever he was settled he
            worked; and he would make things not only for his own special need, but
            where he could find material for his trade he would also give the rest of his
            earnings to the strangers and the poor who were at hand. But in the other
            places where it was impossible to carry on his trade he was in great straits;
            so that, as he would relate, his sustenance often came from wild herbs,
            or from the fruit of the trees of the desert. But, when we heard these things
            from him, we used to marvel and wonder at the fortitude and heroism of the
            strenuous worker, how great his strength was to bear trials and to endure
            these grievous and severe mischances. When he had completed about
            thirteen years in these conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) of peregrination, and in wearisome
            travelling through the upper countries, he was constrained by love of the
            brotherhood that was with us to embark upon a ship, and he came and
            arrived at <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1529">Chios</placeName> an island of the sea from the upper countries; and, when he
            had received the privilege of worshipping the coffin of the blessed Isidore
            the great martyr, and had remained there some days, that island pleased him,
            and he took up his residence in it; since many believers were indeed to be
            found in it at the time of the persecution, on account of a hospital (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενοδόχη</foreign>)<note></note>
            which <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/779">Theodora</persName> the queen had made in it (and she established monks there,
            <pb n="162"/><pb n="508"/>and many banished bishops resided in it from time to time), while he had
            now indeed also reached the feebleness of old age<note></note> and many diseases, for
            which reason also especially he was led to seek the rest of quietude. And
            thenceforth, while he was enjoying the quietude of the residence in that
            island, he diligently performed the labour of his practices, and he employed
            himself in his handiwork on a large scale, inasmuch as material (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύλη</foreign>) was to
            be found in the date-palm leaves from the Alexandrine ships which touched
            there<note></note>. While he was performing these tasks in this way, and working and
            labouring, he used to sell his handiwork; and retaining a small portion for
            his needs, he would spend all his earnings, and distribute them to the poor
            and the lame and the maimed and the blind and the sick, so that, when he had
            completed about five years in the island, while everyone was marvelling at
            his labour and his practices and his abstinence and his asceticism, then many
            believers in the place asked him to be their chief and spiritual pastor; so that,
            when the blessed <persName>James</persName>, whose history has been recorded above, brought two
            other bishops with him, and crossed to the island from the districts of <placeName>Asia</placeName>,
            <pb n="163"/><pb n="509"/>he seized him by force, and ordained him bishop of the believers of the same
            island<note></note>, while he lamented and fled and refused; and he did not thus escape;
            but, although he had been a presbyter many years before, he was then forced
            to shave his hair which he had left in lay fashion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>); so that, when this
            became known to everyone, they marvelled at him all the more. Having
            completed a short time, he crossed to us also in the countries of <placeName>Asia</placeName>, and
            also laboured earnestly and zealously with us for a considerable time in the
            work of the ministry of converting men from paganism, while much comfort
            and consolation was also brought about for us by his devoutness and his
            venerable old age and the laboriousness of his practices, while we also never
            again separated from one another in our old age, just as we had not done so
            in the time of our youth; but, after we had been carrying on the work of the
            ministry for about one year, that time we came together to the royal city,
            while the blessed man also ended the work of his ministry in the same island
            in which he had been summoned to the bishopric, and removed to the quietude
            of the monastery which by the power of God we had erected by the holy <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2814">Mar 
            Mama</placeName> beyond the water<note></note> and resided there and rested, and he enjoyed the
            quiet restfulness of the place. And, when he had in this way been carrying
            <pb n="164"/><pb n="510"/>out the labour of his practices unto a space of three years, he ended the course
            of his practices; and he fell asleep and his holy body was buried and laid in
            this same monastery; by whose prayers with those of all the saints who
            pleased the Lord may we all find grace in the day of judgment, and may the
            monastery which received his coffin, with the other churches and monasteries
            which he erected in the name of the Lord God of the ages<note></note>, be established to
            the glory of the Holy Trinity unto the end.

            The history of the blessed <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2032">Kashish</persName> bishop of the island of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1529">Chios</placeName> is ended.
