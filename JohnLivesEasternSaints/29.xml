         <head>The Twenty-Ninth(?)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n360-3"/> History, of<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n360-2"/> <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1862">Malkha</persName> the Mendicant and Stranger<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n360-5"/>.</head>
         <p>
            Once when we were in our <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">convent</placeName> adjacent to the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n360-6"/>, before
            it was driven into banishment by the heretics, at the time of the second
            <pb n="563"/><pb n="361"/>Theshri<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n361-1"/> a <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1862">certain stranger</rs> arrived among us, clad in dirty and much-worn
            raiment; and, when he had been received and been required to anathematize
            the heresy that prevailed at that time, as it was the custom to require, he
            stood with us at vespers and at table in silence and without speaking, now
            and again looking furtively to heaven. And so, when he had been hospitably
            received and his soul had been refreshed, he simply refrained from conversation 
            and filled his mouth with<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n361-2"/> thanksgiving. But some of the 
            houseworkers (?)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n361-3"/>, when they saw his habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) and his downward
            looks and the indication provided by his practices, recognised his character
            and said to the rest, <quote>This <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1862">stranger</rs> is in truth a servant of God</quote>. And
            the man who said it himself came up and continued asking him and saying:
            <quote>Whence comes your holiness, father?</quote>. But he continued looking 
            downward and sighing. He says to him: <quote>Forgive me, sir. I am a miserable
               stranger</quote>. He says to him: <quote>All of us, father, are strangers, 
                  and sojourners<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n361-4"/>. But we wish to learn whence you come</quote>. But he on his side
            <pb n="564"/><pb n="362"/>said : <quote>Why? What need is there to inquire? When you see that I am a
               son of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1560">Adam</persName>, know that I am dust like <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1560">Adam</persName> who was taken from dust, and
               upon whom through his sin sentence was given whither he should return.
               Lo! I come from him if you wish to learn; for I have no other place here;
               but pray that I may have one</quote>. These things that blessed man said with
            emotion when he was questioned, and ceased speaking. And so a place was
            prepared for him according to the custom in the case of strangers, and he
            fell asleep like everyone else. But there were some whose sleep was
            wakeful, and who used to watch the brotherhood, who<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n362-1"/> after the house was
            at rest would stand in different places, while some bowed themselves down,
            and some knelt, and some again went outside, and so knelt in corners (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>)
            and in corridors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στοά</foreign>), and prayed; and they saw that this blessed man from
            the weariness caused by his journey fell asleep at once; and again it happened
            that in the middle of his sleep he raised his head and saw that the servitors<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n362-2"/>
            were not yet gathered in and all had not fallen asleep, and he waited a
            short time; and, when he saw that everyone was gathered in, that he might
            not show himself to be up, he wrapped himself in his coat, and fell upon
            his face on his rug; and this while he was weeping gently that no one
            might hear, until he heard the sound of the first bell while the blessed men
            <pb n="565"/><pb n="363"/>were marking him the whole night. And, when he heard the sound of the
            bell, he stretched himself on his rug, and was rising with everyone else just as
            if he had been heavily sunk in his sleep. And, when the houseworkers had
            risen and recited the service<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-1"/>, the same again went on till morning, and thus
            he would weep lying on his face, in order that he might not rise and show
            his labour to anyone, until his eyes became swollen and greatly inflamed.
            And in the morning, when <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-2"/> and the houseworkers also<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-3"/>
            saw his eyes, they say to him: <quote>What has happened to your eyes, our
               father?</quote>. But he on his side said to them: <quote>The air (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άήρ</foreign>) of yesterlay
                  affected me on the road and therefore my eyes swelled<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-4"/></quote>. But those
            who had seen the manner in which he had been employed all the night
            continued saying <quote>Leave the blessed man alone</quote>. During the day he went
            out into the precinct of the monastery, and found a concealed spot, and
            there he bowed himself till the midday bell<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-5"/>, while they were seeking him
            all over the monastery; and then as they were going round they found him
            howed down and weeping. They say to him: <quote>Be so good<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-6"/> as to go in, father;
               for <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName> is asking for you</quote>. He came; and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName>
            said to him: <quote>Where have you been, father?</quote>. He says to him:
            <pb n="566"/><pb n="364"/><quote>Forgive me, sir. I was going round the garden and seeing the trees</quote>.
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">The archimandrite</persName> says to him: <quote>I also know that you desire to see the
               trees of the garden, father</quote>. Then with the usual kindness he bade him,
            inasmuch as he was worn out with labour, go to rest before the vesper hour.
            But he fell on his face and continued entreating and saying: <quote>Because I
               was greatly worn out yesterday, I both ate inordinately last night and
               caused a pain in my stomach (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στόμαχος</foreign>); but for God's sake allow me to
               wait with the houseworkers, in order that my previous food may
               digest itself, and so go to rest with them</quote>. And, when he had pressed
            him strongly and he would not give way, he allowed him to do as he
            wished. And the blessed man, when the service was over, went to the
            corner (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνία</foreign>) where he had been before; and so with his hands stretched
            out to heaven in the form (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπος</foreign>) of a cross he continued crying with tears
            and saying: <quote>Who is there, my Lord, who is sufficient to entreat thee
               for me the sinner, except thy great mercy that is poured out upon our
               race (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γένος</foreign>)? I am ungrateful, my Lord, and a provoker. Come, I pray, to
               my aid. Abandon me not, I pray thee, my Lord. Save me, my Lord,
               and let me be at peace, before I go and am no more. Save my life from
               the corruption of my sins, Lord my God. <quote>Be pleased, Lord, to deliver me</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n364-1"/>
               <pb n="567"/><pb n="365"/>from the confusions and falseness and the deceitfulness of this world, and
               from all that is in it; and have mercy upon me in the day of thy judgment,
               with all the rest of thy servants, for the sake of thy holy Name, my trust
               from my boyhood</quote>. While that blessed man was thus mightily crying
            with many tears, and thought that there were no persons near or seeing
            or hearing him, some men were standing behind the wall, and listening
            to the sound of his sighs, and marvelling at his sorrow and tears before God.
            After three days, when he had seen the doings and practices of the convent,
            that even the very houseworkers also were eager to run with all their might
            after practices of excellence, he made up his mind to pass the winter in the
            same <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">convent</placeName>, and at the coming of the milder season to return to the same
            mountains. And he came to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName> and said to him: <quote>For my
               part, sir, I intended on account of my bodily weakness and fear of the winter
               and the cold to go down to the south; and, since perhaps our Lord sent me
               to be with you this winter, if it is convenient to you I will stay with you this
               winter; and, if so be I am alive and our Lord is willing, in <placeName>Nisan</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n365-1"/> I will
               <pb n="568"/><pb n="366"/>return toward the north</quote>. And <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName> and all the other members
            of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">convent</placeName> also rejoiced, since this was indeed their custom (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>), that,
            if a stranger wished to stay as long as a year and two years and ten, they
            rejoiced over him, honouring him in every respect like <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName>.
            And they consented and they say to him : <quote>We beg you, our father, to be
               with us<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n366-1"/> and edify us by the sight of you, and by your helpful conversation</quote>.
            And from that time he determined to remain; and so he thenceforth
            doubled his labour, keeping silence and hiding his head and weeping.
            Even when eating and sitting at table, even so also his tears could not be
            restrained, but he would eat and bow his head down and weep; and so no
            words came rapidly out of his mouth except prayer and thanksgiving, and
            unceasing sighs. When some time had passed, those who cared about
            methods of life, and judged and repelled their thoughts, used to go and beg
            him one by one to tell them a rule of life and an illustration of the method of
            contending against the thoughts of the rebellious fiends. But he in great
            humility would fall upon his face and make entreaty, saying: <quote>Forgive me,
               <pb n="569"/><pb n="367"/>brethren, for I am sick, and pray for me; and, seek not such things at the
               hands of me a sinner. Be persuaded by the blessed apostle who says: <quote>If
                  a man hath not been able to rule his own house aright, how is he capable
                  of ruling God's church?.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n367-1"/> And now I for my part am sitting in the darkness
               of sin; but show your love and pray for me</quote>. And, when <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName>
            often pressed him to speak, he himself said to him at last <quote>Father, show
               your love to God and pray for me, with all the rest of your <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">convent</placeName>. For as
               for me the day has come for me to set out on my journey, and I am not
               sufficient for it</quote>. They, thinking that he meant <quote>I am setting out for the
                  mountains</quote>, say to him: <quote> Rest yourself, our father. It is still winter and
                     no man, can set out on a journey to-day</quote>. He says to them weeping:
            <quote>Nay indeed, the winter has not yet come, but it is just coming; in which as
               you say no man can either set out on a journey nor yet work<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n367-2"/>. And now, my
               fathers and my brothers, pray for me. This is my convent; for God sent me
               to you, that through the remembrance of your petition I may find mercy in
               that day. My sins have overtaken me and I could not see it. My brethren,
               pray on my behalf, that I may escape from the torment. The end has
               overtaken me, and the day after tomorrow I shall depart from this life to
               <pb n="570"/><pb n="368"/>our Lord. Accordingly I entreat you one and all to make entreaty on my
               behalf; and you yourselves also, my brethren, be strong. You are running
               well<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n368-1"/>. Perform this your life-service unto the end; for in every matter about
               which you concern yourselves there is one object that is sought. You know
               all; you are perfect in all; and you are able to admonish others also. And
               therefore, my fathers and brothers, inasmuch as a few days ago also your
               affection required of me to speak these words, now in order not to be
               ungrateful for your affection and your good will, lo! I put you in mind of
               these your principles, not teaching you, but<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n368-2"/> things on which you are
               meditating at all times. Our Lord is at hand. Be anxious for nothing,
               but always let your prayers and requests be made known before God's<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n368-3"/>.
               For, <quote>when ye see all these things, know that it has reached the door</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n368-4"/>.
               For from this time we must truly know that it has reached the door; for
               the word of him who said it is not falsified. And again we know that this
               also is written, <quote>There is great fear of falling into the hands of the living
                  God</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n368-5"/>; and again <quote>We shall all stand before that dread judgment-seat (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βήμα</foreign>)
                     <pb n="571"/><pb n="369"/>of righteousness, that each one of us may be requited for that which has been
                     wrought by him, be it good or be it evil</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n369-1"/>. Let us think upon these things,
               my brethren. Let us, my beloved, fear the dread final hour. Let us dread
               the moment when each one of us shall receive an account upon his fingers,
               and his hands shall be hung up and his neck shall be laid bare and he shall
               be made an accuser against himself in the presence of justice. For who shall
               contrive a means of shunning or escaping that hour, since who is there who
               shall be hidden by his eloquence? Who shall say <quote>Thou art innocent, my
                  heart, and thou hast been purified from sins</quote>?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n369-2"/> Accordingly, my brethren,
               inasmuch as we are all abundantly persuaded of these things, let them be
               depicted before our eyes at all times, and written on the tablets of our heart<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n369-3"/>,
               that so, while we rest before the grace that is full of mercy all the days of
               our life, even if we are not capable of doing aught else, at that moment of
               trepidation and fear it may spread its wings and cover us, and we may by
               it be delivered from the eternal torment, of which we ought not to hear with
               indifference as if it were a tale, but with great fear and mighty trembling</quote>.
            While then that blessed man was saying all these things in the presence
            <pb n="572"/><pb n="370"/>of us all amidst his many sighs, and amidst copious tears, with great emotion
            and with many sobs, he caused us also to listen to him in great astonishment
            at him, since we saw that no sign of bodily infirmity was to be seen on him,
            and he confidently pronounced that after three days he would depart from
            the body. While we were thus gathered together, for two days and nights
            he sat and said the same things to us all; but on the third night he again
            requested that prayer might be made for him and incense set, and he might
            receive absolution while he wept and said: <quote>It is written <quote>None that liveth
               shall be innocent before thee</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n370-1"/>. Therefore we must not trust in ourselves.</quote><!-- This end quote not in Brooks but required by the sense. -->
               And, when we had all knelt, and prayer had been made, and when the altar
               had been opened, and incense set, and everyone was overpowered with
               sorrow on account of the words spoken, he was standing and weeping, and
               at last he continued crying to all of us: <quote>My brethren, pray for me; for I
                  am not repeating my praises before you; <quote>he who praiseth himself is not
                     he who is approved, but he whom God praiseth</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n370-2"/>. Upon me has come the
                  end of death; and human praise is no longer needed by me, nor yet honour;
                  but, since God sent my sinfulness to you to bury my body, I will not prevent
                  <pb n="573"/><pb n="371"/>any of you from knowing the things that he worked with me by his help all
                  my days. It is to-day thirty-nine years that I have worn this habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>),
                  on mountains and in caves and among men; and, since I received the habit
                  (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>), I have not possessed anght heside <persName>Christ</persName>. No lie has come out of
                  my lips; I have not spoken evil words to men or reviled any man. My
                  speech has been naught but as our Lord said, <quote>Yea, yea</quote> and <quote>Nay, nay</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n371-1"/>.
                  I have not said <quote>Yea</quote> unless it was in truth <quote>Yea</quote>, nor yet <quote>Nea</quote> without it
                  also being true. I have not sought anything that would benefit me and harm
                  another. I have not murmured against my God during my troubles and distresses 
                  and he himself is my witness. This is the time during which amid
                  the troubles of pilgrimage (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ξενία</foreign>) I have not murmured in my heart against any
                  man who did not receive me and entertain me. The man who reviled me
                  and drove me away was not treated by me with less respect than the man
                  who honoured and entertained me. And these things, my brethren, I have
                  repeated before you even as they are manifest before God, because I saw that
                  these objects lie before you too, and not in order that you may imitate me,
                  but let us all imitate <persName>Christ</persName> our God the teacher of these things, because he
                  himself truly taught this humility in his person, and showed it to us. My
                  <pb n="574"/><pb n="372"/>brethren, pray for me and abide in peace. God keep your community</quote>.
            And the blessed man went into the vestry<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n372-1"/> in order to pray and stretched
               himself out and lay down there, while everyone was looking for him to come
               out. And <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/3183">the archimandrite</persName> went in and saw him lying on a paving-stone
            and said to him: <quote>Father, be so good<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n372-2"/> as to lie upon a rug</quote>. And, when
               he had spoken to him, he gave up his soul to God. And on this happening
               great fear fell upon everyone; and so in fear they brought the blessed man
               out; and he was buried with a great procession of all the believers of the
               city. May God whom he served for a long term of years magnify his memory
               with that of the saints who did his will, and that of the holy God-bearer <persName>Mary</persName>,
               and may we for our part be helped through their prayer, Amen and Amen!

From p. 365 they seem to have been an inferior class of men, yet at p. 363 they associated with the archimandrite. The lexx. give no help. They were perh. novices or lay monks who were required to perform certain menial offices; cf. p. 280. The fact that they recited service (p. 363) is hardly decisive against this, since we find the laymen Abraham (p. 121) and Tribunus (ch. 44) reciting service. They perh. derived their name from being specially attached to the archamandrite.</note>
