            When we considered the words of our Saviour and Redeemer <persName>Jesus</persName> in
            his preaching to <persName>his saints</persName> which he said, <quote>Let your light so shine before
               men, that they may see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is in
               heaven</quote><note></note>, it seemed to us that this is not disagreeable to his will, that
            the light of the deeds and of the triumphs of <persName>his holy disciples</persName> should at all
            times arise and be made known and appear among men, as indeed the
            sense of his holy saying declares; and for this reason, although we may
            seen to be presuming to set foot in things that are too great for us, by the
            power of his saying and the hope of his gift we have been encouraged to
            approach the task of compiling histories concerning their ways of life and
            their brave triumphs and the characters of their good deeds, that, we
            may draw, though obscurely, by means the vile and common pigments of
            <pb n="2"/><pb n="2"/>our poor words, the pattern of their likenesses for posterity, [and] leave it
            in the memorial of our writings; so that, when they read and see their good
            deeds and marvellous ways of life, by this means we opine that two beneficial 
            results will be produced, one that when they see their good deeds
            they may also glorify their Father who is in heaven as it is written, and the
            second again, that, when the light of the narratives of their ways of life
            shines upon souls entangled in the vanities of this world and darkened by
            error, they may be enlightened by the light of their triumphs and be eager
            to imitate them, and to receive their patterns in themselves, in order that
            they may attain to their crowns, and hear with them the life-fraught call that
            says <quote>Come enter, ye blessed of my Fathers</quote><note></note>. For these reasons therefore,
            since I dreaded even to hear the apostolic saying that condemns the man
            who knows what is good and does it not by the sentence of sin”, I determined 
            not to conceal and cover with silence the great and marvellous virtues
            that I have seen and known and clearly learned in heroic and divine persons,
            and I am confident of bearing true witness without fear and without hesitation; 
            having first formed this resolution in my mind, that, though I hear
            <pb n="3"/><pb n="3"/>that a few days ago and now also there have been and indeed are in the
            districts round us heroic and brave men, for my rart except those of whom
            I have been an eye-witness in every one of their actions for a long time and<note></note>
            a witness of the truth of them I will in no case commit any the of to the
            memorial of my handwriting’, actions to the truth of which besides myself
            all the other men of our time are also witnesses, actions that were wrought
            in those men heroic in their ways of life, with every one of whom I was in
            intercourse from my childhood down to their own end; of whom some fell
            asleep some time ago, and some during this time, and some are still illustrious 
            in the body, men who have power to perform apostolic signs, since
            to each one of them according to the blessed apostle's saying gifts are 
            distributed and given<note></note>, to this miracles, to that great ways of life without
            signs, to another beauty of heart and purity, to another ready sorrow and
            copious tears, to another self-denial and perfect pilgrim life, in addition
            to the other distributions of gifts, consisting in the beauties that each
            one of them severally used to depict upon his person. These marvel<pb n="4"/><pb n="4"/>lous and 
            divine beauties therefore I have set myself to bring to the
            record of narratives, while the spiritual beauties and great triumphs 
            themselves, without the interposition of elegant language, are related by their
            natural simplicity of heart with which as is written they glorified God<note></note>,
            and we record the active manifestation of the ways of life of every one of
            them without ornate diction and artificial combinations of words, rejecting
            and dismissing all worldly elegance outside the circle of these admirable
            and divine beauties, lest by it we soil their holy images; which have no
            need whatever of beauty and adornment lying outside their circle, as neither
            has the Giver of their beauties himself, since indeed they are not lacking
            in anything, which also enrich and enlighten others by their beauties. We
            begin therefore from this point to draw the picture of each one of <persName>these
            saints</persName> by relating his history through the help of their prayers and 
            confidence in their petitions on our behalf, and hope in the gift of him who
            strengthened them, that is, as far as our small strength is capable of 
            attaining, through the strength that arises from grace; and at the head of this
            divine company we get this great old man whom a high place at table in the
            heavenly life, where each is in <persName>Christ Jesus</persName>, well befits.
