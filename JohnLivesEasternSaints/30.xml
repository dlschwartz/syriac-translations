         <head>Next the Thirtieth History, of a Man of God Whose Name Was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1704">Elijah</persName>, Who Was in the City of <placeName>Dara</placeName></head>
         <p>
            [....] we arrived, in whose house we were with many others for some days, being
            amazed at the keenness of the man's enthusiasm, as he stood and uttered
            anathemas and called the bishops as well as those who wielded the authority
            of the crown to their faces impious men, renegades, and new <persName>Jews</persName>, insomuch
            that they wrote to the king about him, and he was driven into exile (<foreign xml:base="grc">έξορία</foreign>).
            And he left his employment and his mansion<note></note> and all that he possessed,
            saying, <quote>Let the impious men take them; for my part I seek my Lord
               <persName>Jesus</persName> only</quote>; and so he departed. And he completed fifteen years in
            banishment, without diminishing the kindness to strangers and poor men;
            and thus he ended his life [in] great distinction which surpasses description,
            his distinction not being one only. And out of his practices I have briefly
            <pb n="576"/><pb n="374"/>set down these, while fearing to be accused on account of those which I
            have omitted.
         </p>
         <p>
            The history of a man of God whose name was <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1704">Elijah</persName>, who was in the
            city of <placeName>Dara</placeName>, is finished.
