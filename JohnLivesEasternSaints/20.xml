            Since therefore I was always constantly going to that convent, on account
            of the character of the old man's virtue, and that of all the other saints in it,
            many of that Christ-loving brotherhood, as if they supposed of us that we
            were something, used to come and make revelations about their thoughts,
            and tell of the thoughts with which they had to contend (?); and such answer
            would be made to each one of them as Grace supplied. And thus consolation
            derived from conversation was gained by many; and thus they would rejoice
            and cause one another to think that we, as a person raised above passions,
            were giving them consolation. One day a certain brother', who himself also
            possessed such great pre-eminence of character that the period during which
            the whole of the sole of his foot was lying and resting on the ground during
            the hour of service was reckoned by him as sin (<quote>I have removed myself from<pb n="274"/>
               fervour toward God</quote>); so that it was impossible for anyone to see him (and
            neither did this man so act in common with all, but specially') without his
            eyes extended towards heaven, his soul also being in this way drawn upward
            with his body, so that, whenever anyone observed the soles of his feet, he
            would see him with his heels always raised, and moving up and down, so
            that in this way his soul was extended upwards, and at one moment he would
            stand upon the very tips of his toes, as if he were in the act of ascending, and
            at another moment, when his toes were tired, he would let his soles drop,
            and again raise them, and so all the service; so that, if barbarians? came in
            among them, he would be unaware of them and would not lower the gaze of
            his eyes from heaven; insomuch that I, when he happened to be in front
            of me at the service, was amazed at the fervour of his soul before God, since
            his hands also under his robe, that is the palms themselves, were secretly
            extended, and every part of him was being drawn upwards, while not a
            sentence was allowed to pass out from his mouth without an expression of
            praise or thanksgiving Between each several sentence, <quote>Praise to thee, Lord</quote>;<pb n="275"/>
            again, <quote>Thanks to thee, our Hope</quote>; at another again, <quote>Blessed art thou, our
               Creator. Praise to thy mercy, our Saviour</quote>; and thus his tongue would give
            birth to these fruits all the time of his service, and would send them to heaven 
            in rapid succession without ceasing. This earnest' man therefore fell
            on his face before me weeping bitterly, and spoke with me, and said to
            me: <quote>I, my father, am lost from before God; and from this time forth I am
               ashamed to stand before that majesty inasmuch as I have provoked it; since I
               have deserted it and have served with Satan, doing his will</quote>. But I, when I
            heard it, was astounded, and said: <quote>Tell me what the thing is</quote>, while
            others also were standing and listening and marvelling. He says to me: <quote>I
               have committed a great sin, and cannot confess it before men</quote>. I, thinking
            that perhaps some temptation of fornication had somewhere come in his way
            and he had fallen, say to him: <quote>Tell me your sin</quote>. But he objected, weeping,
            <quote>Be not vexed, sir, that I cannot confess.</quote> But I, because I thought that perhaps 
            he would be ashamed in the presence of many persons, took him apart,
            and said to him: <quote>In case the temptation of fornication has come in your
               way, say, and be not ashamed; because this happened to mighty men also,<pb n="276"/>
               and they repented at once, and were forgiven. And now say, and I myself
               will repent with you</quote>. But he said, <quote>My sin, sir, is more grievous and
                  more lamentable than fornication</quote>. But I again, being greatly distressed,
            raised my thoughts to terrible and grievous things, in which Satan by the
            same desire plunges and suffocates men; and, being afflicted at the thought of
            these things, I said to him: <quote>Blessed man, our God is good and merciful;
               and, however great are the wickednesses that a man commits, if so be he
               turns and knocks at the door of his mercy, he does not reject him; but he
               rejoices over him and receives him. See how his own chief disciple Simon
               fell not only into the simple wickedness of denial, but also into that of oaths
               and curses; and, when he poured out tears toward him, he did not remember
               his offence. And now, if you are willing to tell your case –, and, if not,
               why do you trouble me?</quote>. He said to me: <quote>Now, sir, I will confess. While
                  I was standing before God at the service, Satan threw one of the brothers
                  down, and he came and fell before my feet; and I on seeing it deserted the
                  service of God, and performed that of Satan, and I fell, and laughed over that
                  brother while I was standing at the service. And lo! this is my disaster</quote>.
            When I on my part heard this, I also was smitten with the same sin as he,<pb n="277"/>
            and I laughed over all the depths and heights of sins which up to now we
            had thinking that this might be. And, being amazed at the blessed man's
            spirituality, to think what a height of wickedness the saints reckon such a
            little shortcoming as is neglected by us so that we ourselves do not even reckon 
            it as a shortcoming, I said to him: <quote>In case you have been constrained
               by shame to say one thing in place of another, beware lest Satan deceive
               you, and you be involved in two wickednesses and double your sin by the
               use of falsehood</quote>. But he professed, <quote>This, sir, is my sin; and I seek to
                  learn from you how to meet God</quote>. But I, looking at the nature of the
            man's pre-eminent character, did not bring his thoughts down to the level of
            our contemptibility and say to him, <quote>This is not a sin</quote>, in the first place
            because it is a sin, and in the second since excessive caution would do no
            harm to the blessed man, saying: <quote>Go, our brother, again, and pray to God
               on account of this sin; not for your own only, but also for the rest who slip
               and fall into it like you. And do you, as far as you can, beware both of it
               and of any other. But, if you fall into any sin, beware lest Satan lead you
               into despair and say to you, <quote>You have provoked, you will not be accepted</quote>;
               but, whenever you have any ulcer of sin, lay the poultice of repentance'<pb n="278"/>
               upon it immediately, and do not despair</quote>. And so he accepted the advice,
            and went away; and from that time forward he used to perform remorseful
            repentance for that sin by day and by night.

            Next it has been my desire to record something on the subject of the
            training which I have seen them applying in that convent to those who come
            from the world to receive the religious habit (oxñuce), which pleased me
            greatly. For these are not like all the others who', if a man runs away by
            reason of an offence committed, or from slavery, or from a quarrel with his
            wife, or by reason of thefts and the menace of the law, then he goes to
            a monastery, and at once has his hair shaven from his head, and has passed
            in and been admitted, while the sensual methods and acts of the worldliness
            of this world are thronging within his mind, and also, as soon as he has seen
            that his hair has been removed and he has been clothed in the loose garment,
            he will think that he has now also passed the limit of perfection and of
            monasticism. And for this reason there are many also from whom the leaven
            of their worldliness does not pass away even when they are in a convent
            many years, because the thorns and briers of their loose and dissolute and
            sensual customs in the wordly estate were not from the beginning cleansed,<pb n="279"/>
            and then the pure unalloyed seed of the devout and venerable habit (oxwu.a) of
            religion falls outwardly upon them, and they have put it on at once on the first
            day, and from this time it has been in Satan's power easily to drag and entrap
            and lead many into sensuality and pride as well as into actual dishonourable and
            odious customs and passions of various kinds; because, if the root of
            worldliness remains in its place, the thorns of disorderliness and sensuality and
            greediness and the love of money and evil passions spring from it. In this
            convent therefore it is not so, since from it there come monks indeed
            and not like that rabble who themselves according to the words of Scripture
            seduced Israel to turn against the Lord who delivered them to try him'
            As soon as a layman comes who wishes to enter upon a course of training, at
            first they ask him questions about his country and his family (yévos), and
            what he possesses in the world, and what cause gave rise to this resolution
            in him, inquiring of him <quote>Has any worldly cause turned your thoughts to this
               purpose?</quote>; and, after the man whoever he be has settled all these points,
            so that they may know the genuineness of his desire, if again he in truth
            possesses this in his mind, they inquire of him, <quote>Lo! how long have you<pb n="280"/>
               had this resolution in you?</quote>; and on learning all these things they allow him
            to stand at the gate for thirty days, saying, <quote>Beware lest your thoughts urge
               you to return for any reason, for the sake of kindred (yévos), or for the sake of
               wife, or for the sake of any property. Sit here, and try your thoughts for
               thirty days, if you can die to the things of the world, and then you shall come
               in to live with Christ, knowing this also, that, as a dead man, after they
               have carried him out of his house and laid him in the grave, is no longer able
               either in small or in great degree to consider or think or know if he has any
               worldly property, so he who is buried with God, if he seeks to serve him,
               has no more any kind of worldly property, so that not only does he become
               a stranger to things outside him, but he also seeks even to forget himself, that
               is to abandon his former habits, and then he approaches</quote>. But after thirty
            days, if they see that he is kindled with enthusiasm (?), they again say the
            same things to him and many words, and then he comes inside, while they
            give him free admission and also require him to be regular in attending service
            and watching with the brotherhood, and the weekly ministration', and all the
            the menial labour of the monastery for about three months, making trial of<pb n="281"/>
            his earnestness and observing his alacrity. And, if they see him to be eager
            to receive the mark, and if he is vigilant and presents a petition, then indeed
            he is again called, and many things are said to him: <quote>You have tried, and
               you have seen. Is it too hard for you? after you have received the mark and
               laid a foundation for repentance, let not Satan return again; for from this time
               struggles and temptations such as you have never seen will assail you</quote>.
            And, when he professes every thing, they present him before the altar and
            make a prayer for him, and they take a small round piece from the crown of
            his head, as the custom is (and they take it even from many laymen'); and
            they say to him: <quote>From this time onward you become a penitent, not a monk.
               Remember everything that has been done by you, and make entreaty on
               account of it before God and repent of your former habits, and forget them;
               and cleanse yourself from all worldly foulness for three years. If so be you
               have cloven firmly to Christ, then he will command, and they will clothe you
               in the venerable robe (ton) of his habit (căua), and he will place on your
               hand also the ring of observance of his commandments</quote>. And so they leave
            him again for three more months; and again he presents a petition to be<pb n="282"/>
            tonsured, while this also is their part, to urge him himself to seek
            intercessors'. And again they require at his hands, <quote>Look to your
               thoughts. It is expedient for you now to turn back and it is open to you
               to do so. Can you endure, even after yet other days' journeys (pavciww) have
               presented themselves before you?</quote>. And, if again they see that he is in
            earnest, they shave half his head only, so that for this reason one may see
            many among them whose tonsures differ among themselves. And, at the end
            of a year of his penitence, then his tonsure only is completed, while he is
            not allowed to clothe himself in the coat, nor to bind on the girdle, nor the
            cloak, nor the cowl, nor a regular tunic or a regular coat?, but they bind
            a cord on him over a tunic of straw, and a hood moreover of straw, saying,
            <quote>Be in earnest in your repentance</quote>; and thus they humble his thoughts
            during his repentance, while he longs and expects and hopes until he be
            thought worthy to approach the habit (Gyõu.ce) also. And he completes three
            years', and then he comes before the altar; and again great cautions are
            pronounced, and, <quote>In case you seek to turn back now, it is open to you</quote>.
            And so they array him in the habit (xõp.x), the first foundation which he laid<pb n="283"/>
            having been laid by him unto his end. At these things I was greatly
            astonished, and they pleased me much; for these men are in truth brought to
            religion.
