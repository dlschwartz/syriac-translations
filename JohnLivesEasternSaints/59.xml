         <p>
            Since then God had mercy on his people, and sought to give them help.
            the Lord stirred up the spirit of king <persName>Justinian</persName>, and put into his mind the plan
            <pb n="229"/><pb n="575"/>of letting the patriarchs and bishops examine the subject of the faith before
            him and in his presence; and he ordered both parties, the orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>)
            and the <persName>Chalcedonians</persName>, to meet in the royal city of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, in order
            that the general questions might be examined in the king's presence<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n575-1"></ptr>. And,
            when the order went forth, many assembled from all quarters; and the holy
            Mar <placeName>Severus</placeName> also went up and <persName>Theodosius</persName> of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n575-2"></ptr>, who themselves
            alone and a few bishops with them were left among the orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>),
            and they stayed in the royal city, because the king detained them for a long
            time. And, all the believers being desirous of sending eloquent and learned
            men to the conference, they occupied a little over a year in choosing men from
            the convents and the cities and sending them to the blessed <persName>Theodosius</persName> the
            <pb n="230"/><pb n="576"/>patriarch. Now there was living a short time before in the small city of
            Constantina which is <placeName>Thella d Mauzlath</placeName> among the citizens a presbyter whose
            name was <persName>Theophilus Bar Maʿnu</persName> a good and religious man, one of the
            reverend clergy of his city; and, since he had lawfully taken a wife in
            marriage, and they had no children, he and his consort, having fasted and
            prayed, made a vow to God that the first son who should be born to them
            they would give to the Lord in <placeName>the holy convent of ʾsṭrlyṭys</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n576-1"></ptr> by the city of
            <placeName>Thella</placeName>, which is the monastery of <persName>Fsiltha</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n576-2"></ptr>. And God heard him, and gave
            him a son, and he called his name <persName>James</persName>; and, when he had grown a little.
            his parents handed him over to the same monastery of <persName>Fsiltha</persName> through the
            devout Mar <persName>Eustace</persName> presbyter and archimandrite.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n576-3"></ptr> And, when<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n576-4"></ptr> his training
            was completed, he used to practise perfect modes of life surpassing the
            <pb n="231"/><pb n="577"/>strength of men; and in the course of his employment in the monastery he
            would fast three days at a time and at last seven days, and again at last twenty-one; 
            and all who saw him were held in great astonishment at the way in
            which he repressed the powerful impulses of boyhood. But many times his
            mother wished to bring him into the world, and he would not yield to her
            persuasion; and she used to urge him greatly, because she had no heir except
            him; but his father wished his promise to be carried out<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n577-1"></ptr>. And, being much
            pressed by his mother, he said to her: <quote>Cease speaking to me, O my mother,
               do not weary me. Do you not understand that I have betrothed myself once
               for all to <persName>Christ</persName> the immortal bridegroom?</quote>, and, when even so she did not
            cease, he spoke to his own master and his teacher <persName>Eustace</persName> and said: <quote>My
               teacher and father, pray for me to God that he may either take my soul from
               me or impose silence upon my mother.</quote> And his master said to him:
            <quote>The Lord will effect deliverance if he is pleased with you.</quote> And a year 
            later his mother died, and in the third year his father also; and the wealth
            which they possessed they left to their own son <persName>James</persName>; and they left two
            <pb n="232"/><pb n="578"/>slaves and a large amount of property (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσία</foreign>). But the divine <persName>James</persName>, as soon
            as he saw that his parents were dead, called his two slaves, and set them
            free; and he gave them the house with the property (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ούσία</foreign>) and the chattels
            and he did not take even one <foreign>mina</foreign>; for he used to say <quote>Let the things of the
               world be given to the world.</quote> And after a short time, when he had received
            deacon's orders in his same monastery, he would cause himself to copy
            the pattern of the angels' watchfulness, embracing the immaterial observances 
            of the angels with much fasting and constant vigil, and day by day
            adding to his divine practices. But he refused to let himself be seen outside
            his cell at all during the day; and all the believers used to betake themselves
            to him on account of the fame of his practices; so much so that even from the
            frontier of the <placeName>Persian territory</placeName> those who had various infirmities used to flock
            to him; and as soon as they were resting in his monastery they were cured
            without seeing him. For he would visit many by long journeys<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n577-1"></ptr>, having seen
            them beforehand by the vision of the Holy Spirit, and be seen by them in
            a dream and they would be healed of their diseases<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n577-2"></ptr>; insomuch that he often<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n577-2"></ptr>
            <pb n="233"/><pb n="579"/>showed himself to queen <persName>Theodora</persName> herself wife of <persName>Justinian</persName> king of the
            <persName>Romans</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n578-1"></ptr> as in a dream holding a golden paten (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φιάλην</foreign>) in his hands and giving
            the armies of the <persName>Romans</persName> living<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n578-2"></ptr> water to drink; and accordingly the
            miracles which he performed caused all the world to marvel. The bands of
            the Christian <persName>Saracens</persName> attached to the <persName>Romans</persName>, having once been attacked
            by insanity, and having heard about the man's holiness, sent their king<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n578-3"></ptr>
            whose name was <persName>Hereth Bar Gabala</persName> with their magnates to him, in order
            that God might visit them through him; and <persName>Hereth</persName> took gold with him with
            offerings to give the saint if God<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n578-4"></ptr> would visit them through him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n578-4"></ptr> by his
            prayers. But as for the blessed <persName>James</persName>, the whole of their affair having been
            revealed to him by God, when they had crossed the river <placeName>Euphrates</placeName> to come
            to his monastery, the saint appeared to the <persName>Saracens</persName> in his habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) at
            full morning, and said to <persName>Hereth</persName>: <quote>Why, O barbarian<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n578-5"></ptr>, did you doubt of the
               gift of God? Go return to your land, you and your magnates, and release the
               man from <placeName>Mt. Sinai</placeName> whom someone is detaining in your camp, and you will
               <pb n="234"/><pb n="580"/>immediately be delivered from the distress; for it is because of him that
               you were afflicted. But henceforth Satan will not be permitted by the Lord
               to work destruction among you, until you enter the camp. And <quote>thy money
                  go with thee</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n580-1"></ptr>, since we have no desire to possess aught beside God.</quote> And,
            this openly-shown vision having caused <persName>Hereth</persName> the king and his magnates to
            marvel, he went back to his camp, and upon asking he found that from the
            hour that the blessed man said to him, <quote>The devil shall not work destruction
               in your camp</quote>, from that very hour and that very day they<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n580-2"></ptr> were cured.
            And they asked and inquired over the whole of his camp, and they<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n580-3"></ptr> found a
            certain monk who was bound inside a tent; and he released him and sent him
            to <placeName>Mt. Sinai</placeName>; and the man who had bound him in his tent<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n580-4"></ptr> he slew with the
            edge of the sword; and day by day <persName>Hereth Bar Gabala</persName> was yearning to see
            the saint. But the blessed man would quietly labour with arduous labours
            and exercise himself in marvellous endurance in the way of modes of life and of
            clothing; for he would cut a thick ugly cloak into two, and he clothed himself
            <pb n="235"/><pb n="581"/>with half of it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n581-1"></ptr> and covered himself with half of it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n581-2"></ptr>; and he would not change
            this raiment for a considerable time, not in summer nor in winter, until it
            appeared to be all rags<note></note>; for he would say <quote>It is better for the soul to clothe
               itself in practices of excellence than for the body to luxuriate in things that
               drag to perdition</quote>. Being therefore resplendent in holiness he used to astonish 
            many by miracles. Two barren women from the city of <placeName>Thella</placeName>, being
            distressed by the deprivation of children, and who were looking for the fruit
            of their wombs more than the breath of the air (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άήρ</foreign>), and had gone to many
            places to seek assistance, resolved to go up to the same saint at the time
            when he was present in his monastery; and they went out from the city to go
            to his convent. When they had reached and crossed the river <placeName>Harba</placeName> that is
            between the monastery and the city, a revelation was made to the saint by the
            divine Spirit; then (<foreign xml:lang="grc">είτα</foreign>) he sends a deacon of his to them to tell them to
            return to the city; <quote>For our Lord</quote> (he says) <quote>will give you children if you
               confess his holy name</quote>. And they on hearing these words returned to the
            <pb n="236"/><pb n="582"/>city. And the saying of the saint was accomplished; for after one year our
            Lord gave them children, and afterwards sons and daughters, and they
            continued praising the name of God.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n582-1"></ptr>
         </p>
         <p>
            But, after a considerable time had past, and he was radiating light in this
            world like a bright sun, he was chosen by the grace of God to go up to the
            royal city, to argue on behalf on the faith in conjunction with certain saints
            and father<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n582-2"></ptr>. He was unwilling to do so, but nevertheless he was going up
            in obedience to a vision which appeared to him, the holy Mar <placeName>Severus</placeName> the
            patriarch<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n582-3"></ptr> and Mar <persName>John</persName> bishop of <placeName>Thella</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n582-4"></ptr>, who came to him and gave him a
            pastoral staff and said to him with a threat, <quote>Rise go with the companies of
               believers and feed our sheep, and keep them from the wolves</quote>; and thereupon
            he took a small gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγέλλιον</foreign>) and set out to go on foot to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>.
            And there joined him from his monastery a certain well-tried and divine man
            who was called <persName>Sergius</persName>, who after a time was made a bishop by the blessed
            man himself. And, when the two had gone to the royal city and arrived
            <pb n="237"/><pb n="583"/>there, the report flew about in the city, <quote>Father <persName>James</persName> has come</quote>; and, when
            <persName>Theodora</persName> the queen heard it, she received them with much honour, and she
            gave them a house and the rest of what they required. But the blessed man
            was eloquent and educated and skilled and exercised and practised, and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n583-1"></ptr> he
            was versed in the Greek language as well as the Syriac to a specially high
            degree, and he read the Holy Scriptures in both languages; and, when he
            carried on debate with the chiefs of the heresy there in their own assembly,
            he put them all to flight, while he also through the mighty flashes of the
            divine doctrines (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>) exposed their tricks and frauds against the truth of
            the faith, and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n583-2"></ptr> he took possession of a little cell, and in it conversed with
            God<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n583-3"></ptr> continually. The blessed <persName>Sergius</persName> also<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n583-4"></ptr> lived an ascetic life, but he
            fell<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n583-5"></ptr> far short of the standard of the high and divine practices of the holy
            <persName>James</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n583-6"></ptr>.
         </p>
         <p>
            When then dense crowds of believers came to the royal city, bishops and
            monks and clergymen, and laymen zealous for religion, they used to boast of
            <pb n="238"/><pb n="584"/>the same saint, insomuch that <persName>Hereth Bar Gabala</persName>, king of the <persName>Saracens</persName>, when
            he heard it, came himself also to the royal city; and because the party of the
            believers had diminished under persecutions and tortures, <persName>Hereth Bar Gabala</persName>
            and some fathers with him begged the God-loving queen <persName>Theodora</persName> to give
            them leave to make two or three bishops in <placeName>Syria</placeName> (for there was not a bishop
            to be found in the whole of <placeName>Syria</placeName> except three<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n584-1"></ptr>, one on the mountain of Marde,
            and one in <placeName>Persian territory</placeName>, and one who had gone into<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n584-2"></ptr> <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>). And,
            since the believing queen was desirous of furthering such measures as would
            be of assistance against the <persName>synod of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName></persName>, she ordered them to make the
            bishops. Then two well-tried men were chosen by the holy patriarch
            <persName>Theodosius</persName> of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and the fathers who were with him to be bishops,
            one this divine<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n584-3"></ptr> <persName>James</persName> for the city of <placeName>Edessa</placeName> and all the rest of <placeName>Syria</placeName> and <placeName>Asia</placeName>,
            and another whose name was <persName>Theodore</persName> for the city of Bostra<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n584-4"></ptr> in the south,
            and <placeName>Palestine</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n584-3"></ptr>, and <placeName>Arabia</placeName> as far as <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>. The divine <persName>James</persName>, having
            received the bishop's office from the blessed <persName>Theodosius</persName> by the advice and
            permission of the queen (for after he had left his see he was afraid to ordain.
            <pb n="239"/><pb n="585"/>bishops<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n585-1"></ptr> without permission of the crown<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n585-2"></ptr>), then accordingly<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n585-3"></ptr> armed himself
            with religion, and clothed himself in the breast plate of righteousness<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n585-4"></ptr>, and
            extended his course not only in the districts of <placeName>Syria</placeName> but also in those of
            the whole of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, and of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName> and in the districts of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, and
            the whole of <placeName>Isauria</placeName>, and of <placeName>Pamphylia</placeName> and <placeName>Lycaonia</placeName> and <placeName>Lycia</placeName> and <placeName>Phrygia</placeName>
            and <placeName>Caria</placeName> and <placeName>Asia</placeName> and the islands of the sea, <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>, <placeName>Rhodes</placeName>, <placeName>Chios</placeName>,
            <placeName>Mitylene</placeName>, up to the royal city itself; and he propagated and expanded all
            orthodoxy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n585-5"></ptr>, and made priests, and filled the ranks. And not only
            did he marshal priests and supply all quarters, but he did not even neglect
            churches that were at a distance; and the Lord put it into his mind, and he
            contrived means of adorning the church of God. And, since there is a
            prudent canon that without three bishops or four no bishop shall be instituted,
            he considered the matter and took with him two monks who had a reputation.
            for excellence of life, one from <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, and one from <placeName>Isauria</placeName>, and took them
            <pb n="240"/><pb n="586"/>to the royal city. And he received advice and permission from the holy
            <persName>Theodosius</persName> the patriarch who was at that time residing there by way of exile
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">έξορία</foreign>), and he directed his path to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, with these two blessed men<note></note>.
            that he might there consecrate them bishops, because there was no bishop in
            <placeName>Syria</placeName> except one, nor an orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>) patriarch; but of the <persName>synod of
            <placeName>Chalcelon</placeName></persName> there wins a patriarch at <placeName>Antioch</placeName><note></note>, Ephraim the heretic<note></note>, from the
            city of <placeName>Amida</placeName>, the wicked persecutor of religion.
         </p>
         <p>
            But the holy <persName>James</persName>, when he had completely performed his ministry in all
            the countries from the royal city as far as the sea-coasts, then thus entered
            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>; and when he had been<note></note> in intercourse with the saintly<note></note> bishops
            there then they admired the saint's austerity, that he had travelled through
            these countries without an animal to ride, and without a wallet or bronze
            coins or a purse, according to the commandment received from the blessed
            patriarch <persName>Theodosius</persName><note></note>. And accordingly the saintly bishops<note></note> assembled,
            and made the two blessed men who were with him bishops, one whose name
            <pb n="241"/><pb n="587"/>was Conon in Tarsus a city of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, and the other whose name was <persName>Eugene</persName>
            in the city of <placeName>Seleucia</placeName><note></note>; and further for <placeName>Syria</placeName> two, <persName>Antony</persName> and <persName>Antoninus</persName><note></note>.
            And he took them with him and set out for <placeName>Syria</placeName>; and in accordance with the
            provision of the canons he made metropolitan in the city of Laodicea a divine
            man whose name was Dimet<note></note> from the holy convent of <persName>Aphthonia</persName>, and another
            whose name was <persName>John</persName> from the monastery of Mar <persName>Bwzy</persName> of <placeName>Seleucia</placeName> in <placeName>Syria</placeName>;
            and <persName>John</persName> from the monastery of the house of Mar Bassus in Kenneshrin<note></note>; and
            another whose name was <persName>Sergius</persName> in the city of <persName>Charrhae</persName>, from the monastery
            of the house of <persName>Aphthonia</persName>; and another <persName>John</persName> from the monastery of Mar
            Hananya of the city of <placeName>Sura</placeName>. And, when he<note></note> had, as described, set up bishops
            and priests in various cities, afterwards they went up to the royal city; and he<note></note>
            made patriarch for <placeName>Antioch</placeName> in<note></note> <placeName>Syria</placeName> a man whose name was <persName>Sergius</persName> from the
            city of <placeName>Thella</placeName>, who was residing in the royal city<note></note>, and was illustrious for
            religious learning; and<note></note>, having completed three years, he departed from
            the world. After a time he<note></note> ordained as his successor an Alexandrine whose
            <pb n="242"/><pb n="588"/>name was <persName>Paul</persName>. And in <placeName>Amida</placeName> he made a man whose name was <persName>Eunomius</persName>
            from the city of <placeName>Amida</placeName> metropolitan, who had been expelled with the clergy
            of the same <placeName>Amida</placeName>, and was in the royal city; and he made many bishops for
            <placeName>Egypt</placeName><note></note>. And afterwards the blessed men set out for the districts of <placeName>Asia</placeName><note></note>
            for the second time; and he made four bishops, one in <placeName>Ephesus</placeName> and in the
            whole of <placeName>Asia</placeName>, me the sinful <persName>John</persName> the Syrian, the converter of the pagans, and
            author of the Ecclesiastical History, who am from the house of Mar <persName>John</persName> at
            <placeName>Amida</placeName>; and in the city of <placeName>Smyrna</placeName> a man whose name was <placeName>Photius</placeName><note></note> and another
            <persName>John</persName> in the city of <placeName>Pergamum</placeName>; and <persName>Peter</persName> in <placeName>Dorylaeum</placeName><note></note>; and also in the island
            of <placeName>Chios</placeName> a divine man and worker of miracles whose name was <placeName>Kashish</placeName>, a
            member of my monastery of Mar <persName>John</persName> at <placeName>Amida</placeName>; and for <persName>Dara</persName> he made <persName>John</persName>
            bishop a divine man from the monastery of <placeName>Karthamin</placeName><note></note>. And in the whole
            <pb n="243"/><pb n="589"/>world he appointed eighty-seven<note></note> bishops, and two patriarchs. And, being
            armed with divine strength, he would go out to his ministry, and would pour
            out the priesthood over the countries of <placeName>the East</placeName> like a great river in the days
            of <placeName>Nisan</placeName><note></note>, having entered upon the road of heroism at a vigorous and spiritual
            pace, and according to the saying of the apostle clothed himself in the breastplate 
            of righteousness, and girded his own loins with the perfection of faith<note></note>;
            and he was at all times carrying on a contest on behalf of the truth <quote>on the
               right hand and on the left in glory and in dishonour</quote>. And he would run
            at a vigorous pace through the upper and lower countries, from the <placeName>Persian
            territory</placeName><note></note> even as far as the royal city, and <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and the countries
            between, and fulfil the work of his ministry not only by organizing the clergy
            and giving the priesthood, but by consoling and comforting, and edifying
            and strengthening in teaching all the party of the believers. Once when he
            was travelling through the districts<note></note> he came to a mountain-range called <placeName>Izla</placeName><note></note>;
            and he went into a village called <placeName>Gumtha</placeName><note></note>; and, while he was in the village,
            <pb n="244"/><pb n="590"/>a certain Jewish<note></note> sorcerer was there, who was deceiving the people by his
            sorceries. When the blessed man heard about the same Jew<note></note>, he ordered
            them to bring him before him; and, when he came, he spake and said to him
            <quote>Wherefore, O impious man, are you doing iniquity and wrong, and opposing
               the right ways of the Lord?" Accordingly you shall be silent, and not hear
               nor speak unless you confess <persName>Christ</persName>.</quote> And the same hour his tongue
            withered and his ears were stopped, and he became like a stone. And,
            when the people stood in great astonishment, Satan came out from under the
            feet of that Jew in the form of an Ethiopian, and he wailed with a loud voice
            and said, <quote>Out upon you, bishop <persName>James</persName>; for from your boyhood you have
               been a vexation (?) to me</quote>. And the holy <persName>James</persName> rebuked him; and he left
            the village with his hands laid upon his head. And the blessed man spake,
            and said to the proprietors of the village : <quote>Satan has fled, be enlightened in
               the Lord</quote> . But the proprietors of that village had gone astray in the heresy
            of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName>; and he stayed there a long time in order to correct them. But
            afterwards he came to the city of <placeName>Edessa</placeName>; and, when the believers there had
            been refreshed by his words, then it happened that suddenly a son of a
            <pb n="245"/><pb n="591"/>great family of the place whose name was <persName>Theodore</persName> died suddenly<note></note> within
            his chamber; and he caused much sorrow to the city by his death. And,
            when the blessed man heard the wailings and weeping and sobbing, he asked
            those who were near and said, <quote>What is this outcry whereby the city has
               been disturbed?</quote>. And they said to him: <quote>A son of great family, <persName>Theodore</persName>,
                  has died suddenly; and we say that it is on account of the sins of his parents.</quote>
            The holy blessed man answered and said to them: <quote>Not so, but in order
               that God may be glorified through him</quote><note></note>. And he went on his feet to
            that dead man's house; and the citizens were laughing and saying:
            <quote>What, pray, are this fellow's patches after?</quote>. But he did not give
            way to their words; but he knelt upon the ground in prayer; and on rising
            he said in presence of the multitudes of the city, <quote>In the name of our Lord
               <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, one undivided nature, who was crucified for us on the cross,
               rise walk"</quote>. And, as the saint spoke, that young man woke as if from
            sleep and stood up; and when his parents and kinsmen asked him, <quote>How did
               it happen to you?</quote>, he said to them; <quote>A man of fire came upon me while I
                  <pb n="246"/><pb n="592"/>was lying on my rug, and moved his hand and took my soul from me; and
                  I saw this saint, and two old monks, who were making request of God on my
                  behalf; and the man of fire was sent with them, to obey every order that
                  they gave him." But believe on this saint, and receive all blessings from
                  him</quote>. And many believed and were convinced by the blessed man.
         </p>
         <p>
            Again another time, while he was visiting the churches and the monasteries, 
            he wished to go and visit two brothers who were residing in the convent
            of the holy <persName>Mar Kayuma</persName>; and the full evening had now almost arrived; and,
            when half of the sun's disk had set, he showed ardent desire before God in
            the vehemence of his spirit, and said: <quote>O su, servant of the creatures of
               God," wait for me till I enter that convent.</quote> And the sun waited and did
            not set till he entered that convent. And, when the members of that convent
            asked him, and say<note></note> to him, <quote>Our father, what is this miracle of the sun?</quote>,
            then he answered, and said to them: <quote>Are you so dull that you do not
               remember the words of our Lord who said, <quote>If there be in you faith as a
                  <pb n="247"/><pb n="593"/>grain of mustard, ye shall tell this mountain to fall into the sea and it shall
                  be done</quote>"?</quote> Afterwards he went in and found one of the brothers there
            seriously ill, and he said to him, <quote>Do you wish to depart to our Lord, or be
               left for repentance?</quote>. And he said, <quote>I desire to fly away"</quote>. And he said
            to him: <quote>Therefore to-morrow morning you shall depart to our Lord"</quote>.
            And all the night he was engaged in reciting service on behalf of that brother;
            and at the hour of matins he ended his life. But the other brother he duly
            fortified like a mighty man, and said to him <quote>Our Lord will not give you
               life except for one year. However lay up the provisions needed for departure</quote>. 
            Having left that place, and gone round the cities and countries, he
            came to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>, and his mighty power was indeed shown. A certain
            citizen's daughter, a virgin, suddenly fell under the power of an evil fiend,
            and was crying and foaming; and, when he had anointed her with the oil of
            prayer, that demon departed from her. And, whenever the proper policy
            was being decided, he used to tell the victorious king all the actions that were
            going to he enacted throughout the commonwealth (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</foreign>) of the <persName>Romans</persName>;
            <pb n="248"/><pb n="594"/>so that in consequence of his performance of miracles his fame was wafted
            to all quarters like choice spices (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άρωμα</foreign>), and the victorious kings of the <persName>Romans</persName>
            and of the <persName>Persians</persName> and remote peoples heard the fame of the same saint's
            miracles, and all the bishops of the heresy of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName> from all sides were
            indignant against him, and sought to seize the blessed man and tear him<note></note>
            in pieces. And, while they were running after him with threats in all
            quarters, he was sheltered by the divine grace, and was not delivered into
            the hands of his pursuers and of those who sought his life<note></note>; for, when he
            wished to go to any district, he would complete the whole work of his
            ministry in one night perhaps and one day, and on the next day he would by
            the divine grace be found thirty and<note></note> forty miles away. And, wherever he
            wished to add to his ministry, he would go by the Spirit of God to the
            district which he wished<note></note>, without wearying; for he never rode an animal
            in his life all the time of his activity. In<note></note> the days when he was staying in
            his convent, a certain man among the citizens of <placeName>Thella</placeName> used to go up to the
            <pb n="249"/><pb n="595"/>saint in religious discretion, that he might be blessed by the blessed man and
            ask his prayers; and he had followed this practice for a long time. But
            this man had a co-sponsor<note></note> who was a presbyter in the order (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τάγμα</foreign>) of the
            church. When then the presbyter saw his co-sponsor going constantly to
            the blessed man, he said to him: <quote>Therefore do you neglect your employment 
               day by day, and suffer loss by giving your time to going to Mar <persName>James</persName>
               the bishop? It is enough for you to be blessed once a month.</quote> But his
            co-sponsor, when he heard these things, continued pressing the presbyter to
            make the journey to the same saint with him, to show him the miracles of the
            man of God; and one day the presbyter gave him pleasure and consented to
            go with him. But Satan the hater of good things on seeing the two co-sponsors 
            going in earnestness and in divine love to be blessed by the blessed
            man showed them an apparition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>), in order that they might not again
            come to the saint's own presence; and, when they reached the door of his
            cell in the monastery, they saw that a girl beautiful to look at came out
            from his presence merry and laughing, and, when, that presbyter saw her,
            he said to his co-sponsor: <quote>See to whom you are urging me to come and
               <pb n="250"/><pb n="596"/>be blessed</quote>; for he was scandalized. And on coming in to the blessed
            man, and seeing no one with him they were both more scandalized, since
            they had seen a woman coming out of his cell while he was alone. But
            the man who was constantly going up to him, overcome by abundance of
            love, revealed before the blessed man himself the scandal that had troubled
            their minds, and began to say to him: <quote>Sir, I urged this presbyter to
               come to you with me, to be blessed by your holiness; and he saw that a
               woman met us who was coming out from your presence, beautiful to look
               at, merry and laughing, and this our companion was much scandalized;
               and even I too was scandalized at seeing something unusual.</quote> But that
            divine man on hearing it knew immediately that that false appearance of
            a woman was an apparition (<foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>) of a fiend; and he thought <quote>It is not
               right that these men should be left scandalized</quote>; and he asked them, and
            said: <quote>Shall you know that woman if you see her?</quote> And they said
            <quote>We shall know her well.</quote> Then he ordered them to pray; and he himself,
            having knelt down, continued entreating God, who wishes for the life of men,
            by his secret power to force the fiend who had appeared to these men in the
            form of a woman to come and appear in the same guise (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) which they
            <pb n="251"/><pb n="597"/>had seen. And suddenly that woman stood among them, looking gloomy.
            And the blessed man asked them, <quote>Is this the woman whom you saw?</quote>
            And they said, <quote>It is certainly she.</quote> And, while they still supposed that
            it was a woman clad in flesh, the saint breathed upon her and made the
            sign of the cross, and said: <quote>Go to perdition, evil fiend, and be not a
               stumbling-block to believers.</quote> And as he spoke that woman became like
            smoke, and vanished from before them. And, when the men who had been
            scandalized saw this, they feared with great fear, and praised the power of
            God which dwells in his saints; and they went down to their city rejoicing,
            and repeating the praises of God.
         </p>
         <p>
            The blessed man then, having remained in his monastery, was for a
            short time<note></note> making entreaty to God for the salvation of the whole church.
            For at that time he would fast for twenty<note></note> days and then eat; and he would
            eat sitting<note></note>. But one day while he was eating he fell asleep; and his disciple
            spoke and said: <quote>Father, rise and sleep a little time on a mat also</quote>. And
            he said to him: <quote>If, my son," you request the angels to sleep, you do
               rightly in requesting me. The holy armies cease not from praise, and do
               <pb n="252"/><pb n="598"/>you desire me to remain silent through sleep?</quote> (for he used not to sleep
            like men, but kept watch all his life; and, if he happened to fall asleep, he
            would sleep a little time while sitting<note></note>). One day a woman from a village
            called <placeName>Theltha</placeName><note></note>, in the territory of <placeName>Thella</placeName>, since she had had children and
            they had died and no children remained to her, came to the same blessed
            man with her domestic slaves; and the blessed man gave her unction through
            prayer, and she had many children.
         </p>
         <p>
            Again on account of men's sins there was a drought caused by lack of
            rain over the whole of <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName>, and especially in the land of <placeName>Thella</placeName>,
            insomuch that the rivers became dry. But, when people saw this, many
            villages and hamlets assembled and made an agreement to come to the same
            blessed <persName>James</persName><note></note>. And they came to his monastery and found him; and, when
            they had spoken with him, he prayed and wept, and he placed his head
            between his knees. And, while they were standing before him, the atmosphere 
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άήρ</foreign>) became dark, and the clouds poured rain upon the earth, for
            <pb n="253"/><pb n="599"/>three days and three nights; and all the people praised God, and departed
            thence rejoicing.
         </p>
         <p>
            What shall I say about the multitude of miracles which the bondman of
            God performed in creation? for he used to do mighty works like the holy
            apostles. And to those who were pursuing in order to catch him be caused
            much astonishment; and often they would meet him and ask him, saying,
            <quote><!-- Missing from Brooks -->Have you seen that blessed" <persName>James</persName> the deceiver who is dressed in patches?</quote>
            and he would turn them back to a district which he had passed through
            and say: <quote>He was at such-and-such a place yesterday evening; but pursue
               after him</quote>. For the report of him would be flying about to-day in some
            village, and to-morrow in another; and he himself would not accept any
            gold or silver or bronze whatever, nor would he allow his travelling-companion 
            to carry any, nor money or food to eat; and every day he would travel
            a stage (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μανσίων</foreign>) covered at a vigorous pace, while he would not consent to
            the fast and severe abstinence being broken; so that men could not travel
            with him for a number of days and minister to him more than a very short
            <pb n="254"/><pb n="600"/>time; for they could not endure the hardship of his angelic mode of life.
            For he used to travel on foot like an active man<note></note>, and had no need to use an
            animal; and, while he was strengthened by divine grace, his body also was
            sound by nature; but he was dry like a stone<note></note>. However every day he
            would make an addition among the believers; and his beneficence everywhere 
            would sorely provoke the adversaries; and consequently droves of
            pursuers with horses and horsemen would pursue after him, and would
            meet one another, and perhaps he would also be present among them, and
            they would not see him; so that, when king <persName>Justinian</persName> heard of it, he promised 
            something great to those who would bring<note></note> him to his presence; and
            many men received three hundred darics each to bring him; and they would
            seek him diligently on mountains and in deserts and in villages, while they
            did not find the bondman of God<note></note>; and he was pouring out the priesthood
            <pb n="255"/><pb n="601"/>copiously in every district and city; so that, if anyone say that a hundred
            thousand priests were ordained by him, I do not think he will stray from the
            truth. But he raised up the faith of the church that had almost disappeared,
            and he contended powerfully against heresy, and lifted up the head of the
            church that was bowed down. For before the blessed man's time the
            believers had been more than ten years without receiving the oblation, or
            having their children baptized<note></note>; for a priest could not show himself at all.
            And the holy blessed man both filled <placeName>Syria</placeName> with bishops and priests and
            magnified and strengthened the horn of the church that was laid low, and
            made bishops and priests in <placeName>Persia</placeName>; and he used to send encyclical letters to
            them that were full of confirmation of the orthodox faith. For he was powerful 
            in divine doctrine, and practised in defending the confession of orthodoxy
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>); and by speaking from the Scriptures he used to silence the
            heretics, since not even advocates (<foreign xml:lang="grc">συνήγορος</foreign>) and<note></note> glib-tongued men were
            able to repress his words. And from that time every city and village and
            convent of monks used to repeat <quote><persName>James</persName>, <persName>James</persName></quote>; and, if the merciful<note></note> God
            <pb n="256"/><pb n="602"/>had not had pity on his church and raised him up in it, it would almost have
            disappeared. For he stood up and preserved the faith of the apostles which
            was handed down by <persName>James</persName> the first bishop of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and filled the whole
            church with beauties, and consequently, when the parties of the orthodox
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>) and of the heretics met one another, they would ask, <quote>Who are
               you?</quote>; and the orthodox (<foreign xml:lang="grc">όρθόδοξος</foreign>) would answer, <quote>We for our part are of
                  the faith of <persName>James</persName> the first of the apostles (and he was termed brother of
                  our Lord in the flesh)", which this divine <persName>James</persName> also proclaims to us</quote>; while
            the adversaries would answer, <quote>Of Ephraim of <placeName>Amida</placeName></quote>, or <quote>Of <persName>John</persName> of
               <placeName>Srwm</placeName></quote><note></note> (the patriarch opposed to God)<note></note>; and hence throughout <placeName>Syria</placeName> and
            in the countries of <placeName>Persia</placeName> and of the <persName>Armenians</persName> the expression became current 
            <quote>We are of the faith of <persName>James</persName></quote>; and in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> again
            the expression became current, <quote>We are of <persName>Theodosius</persName></quote> so that on this
            account the believers of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> were named <persName>Theodosians</persName>, and the <persName>Syrians</persName>
            <persName>Jacobites</persName><note></note>. And the blessed man by his manner of life and by his innocence,
            <pb n="257"/><pb n="603"/>and by his keen zeal against the enemies, and great contests (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) endured
            from his boyhood and down to his old age showed himself a cherisher and
            upholder of the faith, and a worker of divine miracles. Once, when he was
            secretly travelling to <placeName>Mt. Sinai</placeName> in order to visit the saints, with one of his
            disciples to attend upon himself, and had reached the desert region in the
            days of the month of Ab<note></note> in the burning heat of the sun, and was walking
            very vigorously with divine singing for more than forty miles in a protracted 
            fast, his disciple became thirsty, and began to feel faint; and he
            was afraid to tell his master. But, when he had become desperate and lost
            hope of life, he called to his master, saying: <quote>My father, help me. Thirst
               for water has killed me"</quote>. And the blessed man on turning and seeing
            that he was already finished said to him: <quote>Pray and beg mercy from God
               until I come to you</quote>. And he went from him to a little watercourse that
            was near them; and he went down on his knees, and offered supplication
            to the merciful<note></note> God, and as the old man spoke that place shot out a spring
            of water. Then he called his disciple and said: <quote>Drink and satisfy your<pb n="258"/><pb n="604"/>self
               out of the gift of our God</quote><note></note>. And he drank and was strengthened.
            And they travelled on thanking God for his kindness.
         </p>
         <p>
            But, after he had returned from <placeName>Mt. Sinai</placeName> and come to his convent, <note></note>he
            went to visit the districts<note></note>. Now, since the church of the metropolitan city
            of <placeName>Amida</placeName> had been razed to the ground and fallen when the <persName>Persians</persName> devastated 
            the city<note></note>, and had been rebuilt by order of the crown, the citizens
            wished the blessed man to consecrate it; and they came to him begging him
            to go with them; and, having consented to go,<note></note> he on his part ordered them
            to go before him; and he himself entered the city after them. And a certain
            woman, one of the great persons of the city, was lying with paralysed limbs
            by the city gate; who when the saint passed by her continued crying and
            saying, <quote>Sir, have mercy upon me</quote>; and he reached toward her, and took
            hold of her hand and said: <quote>May our Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> heal you my
               daughter</quote>; and immediately she was cured<note></note>, and went into the church.
            <pb n="259"/><pb n="605"/>And having entered the church he consecrated it in the customary way.
            And to many who were in the congregation God showed a miracle; for,
            while he was standing in the holy place, they saw<note></note> hosts of angels who
            were dancing and uttering praise within the sanctuary and rejoicing in a
            song of praise. And after consecrating the church and ordaining priests
            and deacons there he departed from among them, having informed them that
            they were about to suffer tribulations. Then (<foreign xml:lang="grc">είτα</foreign>) after a short time certain
            persons in various cities and in villages under the pressure of the authorities
            denied the faith of the church, and went over to the <persName>synod of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName></persName>;
            but they are forthwith chastised for the purpose of correction. For God
            sent upon the whole of <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName> on account of the sins of men, especially 
            upon <persName>Charrhae</persName> and <placeName>Edessa</placeName><note></note> and <placeName>Amida</placeName> and <placeName>Maiferkat</placeName>, raging madness
            and blindness of heart, and the population became possessed by demons,
            except a few, but especially at <placeName>Amida</placeName>. Men wailed and jumped, and were
            <pb n="260"/><pb n="606"/>mad and ran as if horsemen were riding after them; and they barked like
            dogs, and howled; and in their madness they bit their flesh; and, while at
            <placeName>Maiferkat</placeName> and at <persName>Charrhae</persName> and at <placeName>Edessa</placeName> it was a small matter, in the city
            of <placeName>Amida</placeName> great madness prevailed, especially among boys and girls. When
            then the citizens saw these things they were overcome with affliction at thinking 
            what a horrible thing<note></note> had happened to their city, and they were
            running to the same saint, and begging him with many tears to visit them.
            But the saint answered and said to them: <quote>How do you wish the Lord to
               have mercy upon you when you deny his Godhead and divide the one and
               indivisible into two natures? But, if so be you will obey me, God will visit
               you</quote>. And they said: <quote>We will do your will, our father; only deliver us
                  from this grievous infliction</quote>. And he granted their request, and rose and
            went to the city of <placeName>Amida</placeName>. But, when he entered<note></note> the city, those who had
            gone mad began to run away from the sight of him and seek refuge under
            <pb n="261"/><pb n="607"/>walls; and having gone into the inside of the church he brought incense
            and set it before the altar; and he ordered them to carry it over all the streets
            of their city and the houses, and on the walls of the city all round; and the
            day was the first day of the week. But, after he had offered the oblation
            and celebrated the awful mysteries, men began to come to their senses and
            recover their intellects and praise God. And again at the vesper hour he
            set down incense, and prayed; and all that night he was offering petition
            to God on their behalf. And at morning on the second day of the week
            there remained not a soul in that city<note></note> which had not been cured and come
            to its senses, and those who had been afflicted began to utter exclamations
            of praise to God, giving thanks and praise, and begging mercy from him.
            Then the blessed man ordered them to clothe and cover<note></note> themselves in black
            for several days. And so he left the city with high reputation<note></note>, while all the
            multitudes praised God the lover of mankind; and he went to <placeName>Maiferkat</placeName> and
            to <placeName>Thella</placeName> and to <placeName>Edessa</placeName>, and to <persName>Charrhae</persName>; and he visited them in the same
            <pb n="262"/><pb n="608"/>way; for there was not<note></note> a dead man among those who had been afflicted.
            And he came and went into his monastery for a few days; and one night he
            called the blessed men the members of his convent, and said to them <quote>My
               fathers and my brothers, let us sorrow for the Lord's people, since it has
               been bereft of the" blessed pastor <persName>Theodosius</persName> patriarch of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and
               he has gone to the tents of the saints; for this night he committed his spirit
               to God</quote>. Now that year was the year eight hundred and eighty-seven of
            <placeName>Alexander</placeName><note></note>.
         </p>
         <p>
            Again too in the period before this, when <persName>Khosrau</persName> son of <persName>Kawad</persName> the
            Persian king came and laid waste the cities and villages on the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>
            and ravaged and destroyed <placeName>Batnae</placeName>, he came also against <placeName>Edessa</placeName><note></note>, and
            encamped against it to take it, and, when he was unable to do so<note></note>,
            of craft in destruction whose name was Cometas, a spy, who used to teach
            <persName>Khosrau</persName> all kinds of evil plans against <placeName>Syria</placeName><note></note>, advised him to order his
            <pb n="263"/><pb n="609"/>forces to build houses<note></note> against the city and to reduce it to straits as he
            actually did<note></note>. But, when the citizens heard of this contrivance, they were
            running to the same holy <persName>James</persName>; for he<note></note> had arrived in the city a short time
            before, and it became known to discerning men that God had brought him
            to save the city. And accordingly the <persName>Edessenes</persName> came to him and said:
            <quote>Our saintly father, offer supplication to God, that he may save it from
               this man and the” impious kingdom</quote>. And the blessed man said to them:
            <quote>Fear not, ye of little faith". Only believe in our Lord. This night God
               will drive him away like <persName>Sennacherib</persName> from <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>; and at daybreak none
               of the <persName>Persians</persName> shall be found in your borders</quote>. And the blessed man
            prayed all that night; and at midnight <persName>Khosrau</persName> saw<note></note> horses of fire, and
            horsemen<note></note> clad in flame saying to him: <quote>Rise depart from our city; and,
               if also you have not done so when the sun rises, we will slay you and all
               your army</quote>. And, when this vision had appeared to <persName>Khosrau</persName>, a stern.
            <pb n="264"/><pb n="610"/>voice cried<note></note> and alarmed his forces and they retired from the city in great
            fear<note></note>. Then the saint's word was being carried into effect, and the Lord
            saved that city by his prayers. Now there was in the same city among the
            distinguished men a certain blind man; and he heard of the blessed man's
            miracles, and went to him by the help of some of his servants, and said to him
            <quote>Sir, have mercy upon me as your Lord had mercy on <persName>Timaeus Bar Timaeus</persName>
               the blind man, and grant me in his name to see light, in order that his name
               may be glorified because of me</quote>. And, when the blessed man heard these
            words, he wept for sorrow; and he was strongly moved in his spirit<note></note> and
            said: <quote>Come near to me and see the Lord's glory</quote>. And he came near to
            him; and he placed his right hand on his eyes and said, <quote>Our Lord <persName>Jesus
               Christ</persName>, fashioner of our frame, indivisible, one, Only one, in thy name may
               the pupils of this thy bondman see light</quote>. And the same hour that blind
            man saw; and the multitudes marvelled, and they praised God and continued
            saying: <quote>Truly this is a divine man</quote><note></note>. And he left the city and went to
            <pb n="265"/><pb n="611"/>greet the blessed men of the divine convent of Bar <persName>Aphthonia</persName><note></note>; for he loved
            it greatly on account of its virtues; and, having entered the convent, he
            both filled up the ranks of the priesthood and did what was customary<note></note>
            (for it had recently been built). But one day, while he was offering the
            oblation, a certain <persName>Saracen</persName> who had recently been baptized was present
            there; and he saw that fire came down from heaven, and saw tongues of
            flame hovering over the oblation, and hosts of angels with bowed head
            before the divine sacrifice<note></note>; and he saw that, whenever anyone received the
            oblation, they wrote his name in the book of life; and that barbarian believed,
            and praised God.
         </p>
         <p>
            And the blessed man left the convent and went to visit the churches in
            <placeName>Asia</placeName>; and he visited all the believers<note></note> with the divine word, and proclaimed
            the news of the gospel (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εύαγγέλλιον</foreign>) to near and far. Having appeared in the
            world like the great <persName>Paul</persName>, and completed his ministry, and perfectly kept
            the faith, he assisted God's church for a space of forty years. Having
            <pb n="266"/><pb n="612"/>received ordination during the years of <persName>Justinian</persName> king of the <persName>Romans</persName>, he
            was living<note></note> down to the years of Tiberius the king the successor of <persName>Justin</persName><note></note>:
            and during these forty years his steps did not pass away from the paths of
            righteousness, nor his tongue from the divine words. But, when he had
            reached advanced old age, a certain scandal-causing calamity sprang up in
            the church, through the fact that <persName>Paul</persName> the patriarch and the saint<note></note> also
            were zealous for the Lord<note></note>; and, in order that a scandal might not arise
            within the church, the blessed <persName>James</persName> made a secret resolve for the sake of
            the correction of the believers to go as far as <placeName>Alexandria</placeName><note></note>; and he took with
            him eight other bishops<note></note> and hastened to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> as I said; for his
            intention was a secret<note></note> from everyone. And, as they were journeying along
            the road, they reached a large monastery on the frontier of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> called
            that of <placeName>Casium</placeName><note></note>. And, when they had gone into the monastery and put
            up<note></note> and prayed, the saint spoke and said to those with him: <quote>Pray, my
               brothers, since the Lord showed me that here I and three of you will depart
               <pb n="267"/><pb n="613"/>from the life of time</quote>. And after he had said these words at daybreak one
            of the bishops who were with him died, who was formerly archimandrite of
            the convent of <placeName>Karthamin</placeName><note></note>; and the holy old man stood up and<note></note> offered the
            oblation for him. And again <persName>Sergius</persName> his <foreign>syncellus</foreign> who also had become a
            bishop fell sick and died. And after three days he himself<note></note> delivered up
            his soul to God, on the day on<note></note> which God commanded it; and again after
            him his<note></note> deacon also, and all these in twelve days, so that men were reduced
            to astonishment and wondered. And the report went out over the countries
            that the light of the church had been extinguished<note></note>. And his companions,
            overcome with wonder, returned to <placeName>Syria</placeName> in great sadness. But the monks
            of the convent of <placeName>Casium</placeName> laid<note></note> the blessed man in a coffin (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γλωσσόκομον</foreign>) and
            took possession of him<note></note> with great honour. Then the whole of <placeName>Syria</placeName> sorrowed 
            over the old man's death; and many came to his monastery and were
            visited. And the people of the<note></note> city of <placeName>Thella</placeName> also suffered many distresses
            <pb n="268"/><pb n="614"/>at being deprived of the saint's bones; and so they were always asking for
            his prayers; and the power of God would visit them; to whom be glory and
            honour and worship, for ever and ever. Amen!
