            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">Community of the Holy Convents of the Amidenes</persName>, Who Distinguished
            Themselves in Great Conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) of Persecution, Who Were Expelled
            in the Year Eight Hundred and Thirty-Two<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n405-1"></ptr>.</head>
         <p>
            Since then thirty years ago also in another book about the persecution<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n405-2"></ptr>
            we put in writing a certain amount about <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">this holy community</persName> also, we now
            too thought it right in the series of histories of the saints also to put a
            memorial of it in writing; for how could it be anything but a reprehensible
            act, while relating the stories of persons (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόσωπον</foreign>) living a solitary lile, to
            cover with silence the story of a great and admirable <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> of saints a
            thousand in<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n405-3"></ptr> number as to which too, if we wish to put an account of it
            in writing, we shall fall no small distance inside the boundary of the subject
            of its history. This <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">divine community</persName> then was composed of a combination
            of the convents great and small round the city of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName> and those inside it,
            and those of its territory (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρα</foreign>), and, as we stated above, contained not less
            <pb n="608"/><pb n="406"/>in number than a thousand men<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n406-1"></ptr>; so that, having all, small as well as great,
            been fired by zeal for the faith, and having been duly girded with the armour
            of truth, they also entered valiantly and heroically and courageously into the
            struggle against the defenders of the corrupt synod of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName>, insomuch
            that by reason of these things they were by a violent persecution expelled from
            their convents, and met together and were marvellously combined in a great and
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">spiritual community</persName>, so that they were driven from place to place and from
            region to region, and after settling in many places were driven out, or because
            they were not convenient and not large enough for their numbers arrived<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n406-2"></ptr> at
            the great and extensive convent in the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2796">village of Hzyn</placeName> in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2858">Ṭyšf</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n406-3"></ptr> which
            is called that of the blessed Mar <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2813">Mama</placeName>; but, though it was large and spacious
            from the times of the great fathers who built it, yet, even though this is the
            case, this great <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> was cramped and straitened for room while living
            in it for the space of five years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n406-4"></ptr>; so that our meanness also, though we had
            still only attained to the tender age of boyhood, were<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n406-5"></ptr> with many others
            attracted by the renown of this <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> to come from the district of
            <pb n="609"/><pb n="407"/><placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2798">Ingilene</placeName>, and received the privilege of living in it, i. e., in the renowned
            convent of the blessed Mar <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/74">John</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n407-1"></ptr>, while we also marvelled and wondered and
            were amazed at the great and divine spiritual practices of that great and
            spiritual people, whom it is impossible fittingly to write about or describe.
            Even if there were in that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> a man of deaf intellect and blind heart
            and hardened soul, it would be impossible that he should not be affected and
            bowed down and repent, and be roused as from deep sleep, and come to
            compunction, and gain affliction of mind, and pour out piteous tears, and
            betake himself to spiritual works of righteousness, and embrace the strenuous
            running in the lofty road on seeing revered old age with honourable white
            hairs bound to the yoke of spiritual labours and duly dragging it, and<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n407-2"></ptr> middle
            age and the tender years of youth also being drawn along in the pursuit of
            abstinence and asceticism, and holiness and watching and fasting and prayers
            that never cease at all hours of the night and day, who<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n407-3"></ptr> used to stand
            constantly before God; while it was a great marvel to hear the thunder of
            their admirable voice, and to listen to their holy and divine singing, not only
            those<note></note> of the canon<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n407-4"></ptr>, but those also which took place privately and separately
            <pb n="610"/><pb n="408"/>during the winter season, from all the rooms and from all the cells and from
            all the doorways and from all the corners (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γωνίa</foreign>), and the corridors (<foreign xml:lang="grc">στοά</foreign>) and
            halls of all that great convent. But in the summer-season these were the things
            that one might see and hear with great astonishment, especially during the
            whole extent of the nights, in all the surroundings of this convent, especially
            in the broad and spacious stony ground, up to some distance from which
            there were men standing and reciting the service two and two, or four or less
            or more, or a master and his disciples, and others were lying alone upon their
            faces, and some way apart from one another, whose voice was heard from all
            sides with mighty crying of rushing tears of weeping, from after the canonical
            nocturns till the matins bell, and so they would again meet together for the
            holy canonical singing, and so afterwards they would the whole day meditate
            on the law (<foreign xml:lang="grc">νόμος</foreign>) of the Lord as it is written<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n408-1"></ptr>, while reading the Scriptures
            and reciting the service and the regular prayers of the hours, terce, that is,
            and sext and nones and vespers and compline<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n408-2"></ptr>, while all idle and vain speech
            had fled and been cast out from among them with all human conversations, or
            <pb n="611"/><pb n="409"/>jesting or laughter, or suchlike things, but instead of these things was to be
            seen thanksgiving according to the apostolic saying<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n409-1"></ptr>, and sorrow and
            compunction, and tears, one conversation only, that with God, one order,
            and one habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>), one union, one concord, one serenity, one quietude, one
            love, and downcast looks, and gentle and sorrowful speech at all hours;
            and, though there were to be found some who were young and some who
            were of light disposition or who were loose in their speech, when we
            looked at one another and wondered, they would thenceforth take example
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τύπος</foreign>) from one another, and learn devoutness, and be rivals in works of
            righteousness; so that, if any discerning man observed the practices that
            were common to all these spiritual ranks, and their sorrowfulness and their
            habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) and their praises that ceased not night and day, and took note
            of their open as well as their secret acts, he would think that he was already
            dwelling among heavenly, not among earthly beings, while all these spiritual
            and brave combatants (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγωνιστής</foreign>) used to pass most of all the protracted
            hours in tears and labours with unceasing sorrow; so that from the first
            <pb n="612"/><pb n="410"/>hour of the night or at latest the second<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n410-1"></ptr> no man in full health was to be
            found on his rug, or not lying on his face with genuflexion and tearful
            prayer, everyone thenceforth emulating and rivalling his neighbour; and,
            though emulation is in its nature a deadly and destructive thing, there an 
            emulation was seen that is beautiful and good and sound, a thing that it is
            difficult for hearers to believe, that emulation ever was a good thing; for,
            when everyone saw his neighbour active and eager and constant for prayer
            and genuflexion and tearful sorrow for the space of a whole night and day,
            and others ranged in rows and standing on standing-posts, and others who
            had fastened their bodies to the walls all the night without standing-posts,
            and others who were tied to the ceiling of the room by ropes and vinebranches, 
            and were suspending themselves by them in a standing posture
            all night, having put them under their armpits, and others who were sitting
            on seats and never falling on their side, old and young and strong and weak,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n410-2"></ptr>
            and that to so great an extent that, even if there were a man who was idle
            and stolid and careless and lazy, he would be incited by the sight of these
            labours, and awake with astonishment as from deep sleep, and would thenceforth 
            labour, and emulate these heavenly practices, while I also the wretched
            <pb n="613"/><pb n="411"/>and poor, though deficient in years which were in the age of boyhood,
            thought to emulate such things, and I would also go out by night and see
            them in these great and marvellous conflicts (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) and labours, and he
            who knows<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n411-1"></ptr> all knows that our description of them contains no embellishment
            or flattery, nor are we able to record a tenth part of the truth of them,
            and<note></note>, if anyone wish to write a record of these holy labours, he will leave off
            far short of the end, with regard to that constant affliction, and with regard
            to the unremitting contrition spread over men great and small, and the
            unceasing sighs, and the copious tears, and the crying and severe sobs
            because everyone was looking at his fellow, and everyone was emulating his
            neighbour and learning and acting, and was practising and imitating and
            was eager to pass his fellow in the race of righteousness; so that many
            among them had the power of performing signs, and used by faith to drive
            out fiends before our eyes, even as in the series of the histories we have
            recorded the story of some of them who were tricked by the evil one<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n411-2"></ptr>, and
            many acts of power and signs took place among them secretly and openly,
            insomuch that paralytics who used to come on the report of the benefits
            <pb n="614"/><pb n="412"/>conferred by them were straightened and healed, and would immediately come
            to receive the habit (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήμα</foreign>) of monasticism, itself, and chosen vessels<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n412-1"></ptr> were even
            made out of many of them, so that everyone marvelled at the report of these
            wonderful things, and crowds of men from distant countries would hurry to
            this holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> and arrive among it in order to receive prayer and
            blessing from these saints, and many who needed healing were relieved, and
            everyone marvelled and gave thanks to God. But we do not wish to cover
            with silence one at least of the many miracles which God wrought in this
            same <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName>, one that resembles the abundance brought about by our
            Saviour among the many thousands out of the little bread in the desert.
            Once, when a dearth had occured in the districts of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2774">the East</placeName>, God who knows
            his own and is known by his own blessed the district in which this holy
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> was settled, in order that he might show his loving care for it, so
            that the produce of that year came forth in it plentifully, and there was a great
            and rich abundance in it, so that the whole district of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2774">the East</placeName> had recourse
            to it to buy corn; so that one day a great crowd of strangers was assembled
            at the door of that convent, and extraordinary expense was incurred upon
            them in the way of hospitality, so much so that the bread which had according
            <pb n="615"/><pb n="413"/>to custom been prepared by the servitors<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n413-1"></ptr> for the food of the brotherhood was
            actually on the point of being exhausted, insomuch that the chief servitors
            and the stewards were coming to the great seniors and saying ruefully:
            <quote>The provision of bread and cooked food which had been according to custom
               prepared for the food of the brotherhood has reached the point of exhaustion;
               and there are still many strangers lying at the door, and we have no means
               of supplying the need of these and of the brotherhood</quote>. But these divine
            seniors answered them quietly, saying, <quote>Glory to our Lord! Go, our sons,
               and bring forth and relieve the poor and the strangers; and, if anything
               remains over for us ourselves, well, and if not, we will keep fasting vigil today, 
               and let the needs of the strangers and the poor and the needy only be
               supplied, and let them not be cut short by us</quote>. Then these men expended
            what was prepared according to the order, until a small quantity was
            left. And, when the canonical service of vespers was finished, and it was
            known that a small proportion of what was needed remained over for supper,
            some words of admonition and of exposition were addressed by these holy
            seniors to all the brotherhood, in which they said: <quote>Since our brothers the
               strangers came to satisfy the necessities of their life, that which was prepared
               <pb n="616"/><pb n="414"/>for us according to custom was brought out, and little remained over. Let
               each of us receive a little present<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n414-1"></ptr> with thanksgiving and continue without
               murmuring, for thus he will have a recompense from God</quote>. And so everyone
            accepted the words that were spoken by the fathers; and they gave thanks,
            and sat down to the little food that was set upon the table, so that everyone
            thought that something to put into his mouth would reach him once or twice.
            And, when all had eaten and been satisfied, the tables were found to be full
            of bread in abundance, more than every day, though that great number of
            men, which as we have often said, was not less than one thousand, had been
            satisfied; so that, when this miracle was suddenly seen, and all had observed
            it, all marvelled and were astonished, and were excited. And the whole
            brotherhood stood on the tables themselves together with all the old heads
            of the convents, and they cry <quote><foreign>Kyrie eleeson</foreign></quote>. with great awe many times,
            with many tears; insomuch that these holy old men addressed many words
            to the brotherhood with emotion, saying; <quote>Lo! see, our sons, our lack
               of faith and our churlishness toward God at all times, that, while he in his
               mercy is always visiting us, and showing his care for us, we wished to
               <pb n="617"/><pb n="415"/>be churlish to our brethren the strangers who came to us, for whose sake
               also this sign has appeared among us as well as for our reproof, since we
               wished to take thought only for ourselves</quote>>, besides many other things of
            this kind which were spoken by the seniors; and awe and thanksgiving
            were excited in everyone. And so a great basket (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κάψα</foreign>) was brought in that
            four men could scarcely carry after it had been filled; and, though not half
            of it had been placed upon the tables, out of the remnants which remained
            after all that great multitude had been satisfied it was filled to overflowing,
            and would not hold the remnants that were taken from the tables, but,
            when it was filled and packed(?), it<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n415-1"></ptr> was falling from it this side and
            that; and great fear and thanks to God were called forth in everyone,
            while the story of this miracle was also spoken of in all these countries
            with great wonder (for everyone pressed to take some of these miraculous.
            remnants, and keep them as a blessing and a great help) and our own
            meanness was there at the supper as the truth witnesses that we also ate
            and were satisfied with everyone, and we took a blessing from it; and
            we have recorded these things not as having been conveyed to us by report,
            <pb n="618"/><pb n="416"/>but because we were eye-witnesses and partakers, so that we have also
            recorded the truth of them and borne witness to it. But he who performs the
            will of those who fear him worked other such marvellous signs among these
            same saints of that holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName>, and all these great holy convents had
            also henceforth one convent and one rule in one concord and unity of the
            spiritual brotherhood, and one administration, and one expenditure and
            revenue, and one table, and one service, and they had one coalition
            throughout, twenty servitors out of each body of fifty men being combined
            together to perform the duties<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n416-1"></ptr>, the separate character of each convent being
            preserved in this only, the fact that its own brotherhood was separate, and its
            belongings and its archimandrite and its priests, while all the affairs of them
            all were administered in common, together with all the spiritual labours of
            brotherly concord of the types which we have imperfectly recorded above in
            few words.
         </p>
         <p>
            When then they had completed a space of five years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n416-2"></ptr> in that convent,
            they determined to take up their abode in the neighbourhood and vicinity
            of their province (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπαρχία</foreign>)<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n416-3"></ptr> of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName>, though by reason of the persecution it
            <pb n="619"/><pb n="417"/>was only under difficulties (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκη</foreign>) that they could appear in the same province 
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ύπαρχία</foreign>). Then they came and took up their abode in the district
            called that of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2774">the East</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n417-1"></ptr>, in a <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">monastery</placeName> called that of <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2834">the Poplars</rs>, on the
            border of the territory of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/8">Amida</placeName>, in the district opposite the hot spring<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n417-2"></ptr> of
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2751">Abarne</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n417-3"></ptr>; so that, when they saw that the place suited them, but that
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">monastery</placeName> was very small and confined for the purposes of their habitation,
            then they were compelled all the summer-time to set up tents for themselves
            outside on the mountains and under the wild trees surrounding that convent,
            and erect huts in extended and varied lines for themselves to dwell in; and
            so they accomplished the great labour of their marvellous practices, being
            also compelled to build and prepare for themselves great houses for winter
            habitation in that <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">monastery</placeName>. When then they had completed a space of
            two years and a half<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n417-4"></ptr> in this place, while we were also with them, they
            were ordered to enter their convents at the beginning of the reign of king
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n417-5"></ptr>. And, when they had also completed nine years and a half in
            the first persecution dated from the expulsion of their convents, they
            <pb n="620"/><pb n="418"/>returned and came in on the invitation, and they found their convents
            destroyed and demolished and knocked to pieces and turned to earth, insomuch 
            that they were obliged to set themselves to labour night and day,
            and build, and set up and restore all these convents, while the whole city
            also, so to say, used to hold sacramental assemblies with them, so that
            few remained with <persName>the Synodites</persName>; so that again, when they had completed
            seven years and a half<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n418-1"></ptr> in the convents after their restoration, then the
            furnace of persecution again blazed up against them, and they were expelled
            and departed a second time; and in this way also a great <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1934">community</persName> was
            assembled, though smaller than the previous one, when they also came
            and dwelt in a convent which itself too had once been a great one <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2850">Thella d Thuthe</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n418-2"></ptr>
            in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2783">Gumtha</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n418-3"></ptr>; and, having again been expelled from this also as well,
            they came back again to the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">monastery</placeName> of <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2834">the Poplars</rs>. And, when they
            had thereafter been completing the labours of these divine practices in this
            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/399">monastery</placeName> for the space of three years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n418-4"></ptr>, then occurred the descent of
            <pb n="621"/><pb n="419"/><persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2274"
               >Ephraim</persName> the persecutor, the patriarch of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>, to <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2774">the East</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n419-1"></ptr>. And,
            when he had several times sent them a persuasive document in order to
            make them members of his communion, when they did not yield to him,
            then he sent armed and armoured hosts of fighting men against them as
            if to fight against barbarians, and they expelled and ejected and scattered
            and dispersed them over the countries; so that in respect of this time also
            one might now describe many marvellous things which God wrought, if
            it were not for the length of the history, and further also because the
            standard of our work is not now raised to relate the story of the persecution<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n419-2"></ptr>, 
            but it aims at describing the excellence of the practices of the saints.
            When then by reason of the persecution of the impious <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2274">Ephraim</persName> they were
            thenceforth scattered and divided, each one of the convents went to any
            quarter that they found and settled there, and in some places two; so that
            they were divided over the territory of <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2775">the Edessenes</rs> and <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2839">the Samosatenes</rs>
            and <rs ref="http://syriaca.org/place/94">the Perrhenes</rs> and the men of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2818">Melitene</placeName> and the other districts, and
            some of them from the stress (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άνάγκη</foreign>) of the persecution even withdrew as
            far as the southern desert also, and <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/3057">ʿArab</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n419-3"></ptr> and <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2800">Izla</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n419-4"></ptr> and the other districts
            and dwelt there<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n419-5"></ptr>. And, when they had set up many places, and built many
            <pb n="622"/><pb n="420"/>monasteries, they found a little opportunity and were drawn by love of the
            coffins of their spiritual fathers, and they came back again and arrived, and
            again entered the same convents after a space of twenty-three years<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n420-1"></ptr> that
            they completed, and for the second time also. And, when they had yet
            again found them quite completely knocked to pieces and demolished and
            destroyed, and when they had again been involved in much labour and
            no small expense in setting them up, and had built them and set them
            up, then again a storm (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χειμών</foreign>) of persecution rose up against them, and
            they were again expelled from them a third time, when they had not been
            allowed to complete even two more years in them<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n420-2"></ptr>, and thereafter return<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n420-3"></ptr>
            to the southern region of the desert and of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/3057">ʿArab</placeName> and of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2800">Izla</placeName>, and of all the
            country round the city of Dara and go down and be scattered over the
            places and the monasteries for the purpose of habitation, while even so
            they habitually showed strength and prowess, down to the end of the life of
            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2284">Justinian</persName> the king, at which also we have now made the end of this history,
            which is the year eight hundred and seventy-seven<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n420-4"></ptr> according to the era
            of the Greeks, so that the time of the persecution of these convents besides
            <pb n="623"/><pb n="421"/>all <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2774">the East</placeName> is no less than forty-five years, and others<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n421-1"></ptr> even more; so that
            even to the present time at which we are committing these things to writing
            they are under the same persecution, we for our part having completed these
            things in the royal city at the stated time, having been under persecution
            together with them from beginning to end, and being so even to the present
            time. And these things we have set down concerning these brave conflicts
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">άγών</foreign>) and great combats, which themselves also do not fall far short of
            spiritual heroism, the beginning of which dated from the year eight hundred
            and thirty-two<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n421-2"></ptr>, down to the present day which is the year eight hundred
            and seventy-eight<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n421-3"></ptr>.
