                  sometimes in place of hypostasis. For even the whole of mankind we call comprehensively
                  'nature', as it is indeed written: "For all natures of beasts and of birds, and of reptiles and
                  of things that are in the water are subjected and are made subject to human nature"<note
                     type="footnote" n="64" resp="#ebrooks">James iii, 7.</note>: and again we speak of one nature
                  in reference to a single man, Paul for example or Peter, or maybe James. Where therefore we
                  name all mankind one nature, we use the name 'nature' generically in place of 'essence'<note
                     type="footnote" n="63" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>; but,
                  where we say that there is one nature of Paul, the name 'nature' is employed in place of
                  'individual hypostasis'. So <pb n="25"/> also we call the Holy Trinity one nature, employing
                  the term 'nature' in place of the general designation 'essence'<note type="footnote" n="65"
                     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>; as Gregory the Theologian the
                  bishop of Nazianzus also said in the sermon on the Holy Pentecost: "Confess the Trinity to be
                  of one Godhead, my friends; or, if you like, of one nature; and we will ask for you from the
                  Spirit the expression 'God'"<note type="footnote" n="66">Or. XLI, 8.</note>. But, when we say
                  'one incarnate nature of God the Word', as Athanasius the prop of the truth and the apostolic
                  faith said in the books on the Incarnation of the Word<note type="footnote" n="67"
                     resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XXVIII, 28.</note>, we use 'nature' in place of 'individual
                  designation', denoting the one hypostasis of the Word himself, like that of Peter also or of
                  Paul, or of any other single man. Wherefore also, when we say 'one nature which became
                  incarnate', we do not say it absolutely, but by adding 'one nature of the Word himself clearly
                  denote the one hypostasis. But the very men who blasphemously call the one Christ two natures
                  use the name 'nature' in place of 'individual designation', saying that the Word of God is one
                  nature, and the man as they say from Mary another. For they do not reach such a height of
                  fatuity as to say that they are using the name 'natures' in place <pb n="26"/> of 'general
                  designation', I mean in the same sense as essence<note type="footnote" n="68" resp="#ebrooks"
                     ><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>: for, if the Holy Trinity is one nature, and
                  all mankind one nature, in the same sense as anything which is shown to be so on this
                  principle, the Holy Trinity will be found (to say a very absurd thing) to have become incarnate
                  in all mankind, that is the human race.</p></div>

               <p>But, when you hear these things, you will perhaps say that we ought not to have spoken of
                  difference between the natures from which Emmanuel is, lest we ourselves be found to be
                  repeating and using the same expression as these proud men. Accordingly, let us also refrain
                  from confessing the union, <pb n="27"/> because they also profess to speak of a union which
                  consists in an association of honour; and, because they speak of two natures after the union,
                  let us also not say that the union was made from two natures, rejecting even the very mention
                  of natures, like silly children, who tremble at terrifying alarms that are fictitious and
                  invented, as if they were truth, and flee to their mothers' bosoms. If on account of the
                  blasphemies contained in the opinions of those men we yield to them words and names which
                  establish the truth, together with the sound of the words the great mystery of religion<note
                     type="footnote" n="71" resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim., iii, 16.</note> goes from us. But, if we be
                  right-minded, we shall both religiously hold to the words and cast out the foul opinions as
                  evil speaking.</p>

               <p>You see that we must also confess the difference between the natures from which the one
                  Christ is, and avoid the cutting into two, and extol one Son and Christ, and one incarnate
                  nature of God the Word.</p>
