               <p>But, since you have thought fit to ask me what is the difference that appears in natural
                  characteristics, I mean of the natures from which Emmanuel is, I will explain clearly and not
                  conceal. (And a little farther on.) For <pb n="32"/> Cyril the truly holy and wise after
                  writing in the letter to Acacius, "Godhead and manhood are not the same thing in respect of
                  natural characteristics"<note type="footnote" n="77" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 40 (P. G., LXXVII,
                     193).</note>, in the second volume<note type="footnote" n="78" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
                        xml:lang="grc">τόμος</foreign>.</note> against the blasphemies of Nestorius writes as
                  follows, as if explaining the meaning of the expression: "For between Godhead and manhood I
                  also allow that there is great distinction and distance: for the things which have been named
                  are clearly different, and in no point like one another"<note type="footnote" n="79"
                     resp="#ebrooks">Adv. Nest., ii, 6 (ed. Pusey, VI, p. 113).</note>. This then is the difference
                  that appears in natural characteristics, the different principle underlying the existence of
                  Godhead and manhood<note type="footnote" n="80" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr. <foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >κατά γε τὸν τοῦ πῶς εἷναι λόγον</foreign>, which clause the translator has omitted above,
                     thus losing the point of the citation: cf. p. 6.</note>: for the one is without beginning and
                  uncreated, and bodiless, and intangible, while the other is created, and subject to beginning,
                  and temporary and tangible, as being flesh and solid. This difference we in no wise assert to
                  have been removed by the union.</p>

               <p>It was sufficient to banish this unseemly supposition, that 'difference <pb n="33"/> in
                  characteristics' was not stated absolutely, but the word 'natural' was added, which declares
                  the fact that it is only by the intellect and by subtle investigation that we can know of what
                  kind each of the natures is which have combined in the unity and made up one hypostasis and
                  manifestly declare that Emmanuel is one out of two opposite things, Godhead I mean and manhood,
                  as Gregory the Theologian<note type="footnote" n="81" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
                     >Θεολόγος</foreign>.</note> said, "Let distinctness be maintained in the unity"<note

                  Eleusinius, which begins, "In wrestling-contests".</head>
               <p>How then, after these things have been written by me, is it not plain to everyone from the
                  words used by the wise Cyril that division also is then understood to accompany difference,
                  when the separate natures or hypostases exist individually, not when one person and one
                  incarnate nature or hypostasis of God the Word is made up by coalescence from two? That the
                  holy Cyril says that separation or division is then joined with difference <pb n="34"/> when
                  the natures exist apart and by themselves is testified by the addition made to the words cited
                  above from the prosphonetikon oration.</p>

            <div type="excerpt">

                  "In wrestling-contests".</head>
               <p>And do not tell me that the holy Cyril alone used the expression in this sense; but observe
                  with sound intelligence that he does not step outside the apostolic faith; for Gregory the
                  Theologian also spoke words that are in accord with him in the passage which we have just cited
                  above. And, if none of the God-clad fathers before him in fact spoke in so many words of unity
                  in hypostasis with reference to the Incarnation of God the Word, yet still all the lovers of
                  the right faith accepted it, inasmuch as it sets forth the splendour of the mystery of the
                  divine Humanization, and it agrees with the opinion of the doctors of the church. Therefore
                  also that wretched and impious Theodoret speaks thus in the objection to the 2nd anathema:
                  "Unity in hypostasis we do not recognise at all, as being strange and alien to the divine
                  Scriptures, and to the doctors who expounded these"<note type="footnote" n="84" resp="#ebrooks"
