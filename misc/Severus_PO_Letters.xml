 <notes> Throughout the text there are notes like "and a little further on" or "and further down".
  They are usually (always?) in the Syriac so they must be from the compiler. Since they oftern flow
  into the text, it's a bit difficult to know how to handle them. In other instances where there
  seem to be elipses within in single letter, the compiler seems to have used section headings. In
  these cases I have begun to use div type="excerpt" with head type="excerpt". I also need to sort
  out cross references to letters in this collection and references to the S.L. of Severus. </notes>

   <p>We also have in the God-inspired Scripture supplies of humility, and no lack of arguments to
    bring us down and help us to keep silence. If you, as if you were about to go up to Mt. Sinai,
    shrink from writing 'to such a man' (referring to me), and think fit to use David's words which
    he says to those who were urging him to take Saul's daughter in marriage, "Is it a small thing
    in your eyes that I should be son-in-law to the king?"<note type="footnote" n="4"
     resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam. xviii, 18.</note>, while I am a poor man and inglorious, I also, when
    required to make answer to your question, make use of these words: "I am not a prophet, nor the
    son of prophets, but I am a shepherd, and a scraper of sycamore fruit"<note type="footnote"
     n="5" resp="#ebrooks">Amos, vii, 14.</note>, if it is not too much for me to say even this: for
    I am not worthy to tell the righteousnesses of God, and to take his covenant in <pb n="4"/> my
     mouth<note type="footnote" n="6">Ps. XLIX, 16.</note>. However, since the time of the present
    struggles does not allow silence, I accept an honourable defeat from you, and turn to the
    question. And in this I defeat you, since I show that you do not practise humility in a
    philosophic spirit<note type="footnote" n="7">The word <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φιλοσοφῆσαι</foreign> is here transliterated.</note>. As to your statement that the holy old
    men called bold speech<note type="footnote" n="8" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >παρρησία</foreign>.</note> fire or warmth, I say this, that we must not use this method of
    speaking without discrimination, but there are occasions for using it and circumstances to which
    to apply it. Our Lord in the Gospels in many parables teaches us in the case of spiritual
    petitions to knock without ceasing and display a praiseworthy audacity. And the saying of the
    Proverbs also instructs us that 'there is shame which brings sin, and there is shame which
    brings glory and grace'<note type="footnote" n="9" resp="#ebrooks">Pr., xxvi, 11a.</note>. Know
    then, mighty man, (for I now return to make answer) that for us to anathematize those who speak
    of properties of natures (I mean the Godhead and the manhood of which the one Christ consists)
    is not permissible. Flesh does not renounce its existence as flesh, even if it has become God's
    flesh, nor has the Word departed from his nature, even if he has been hypostatically united to
    flesh which possesses a rational and intelligent soul: but the difference also is <pb n="5"/>
    preserved, and the propriety in the form of natural characteristics of the natures of which
    Emmanuel consists, since the flesh was not converted into the nature of the Word, nor was the
    Word changed into flesh. We mean in the matter of natural characteristics, and not that those
    which were naturally united are singly and individually separated and divided from one another:
    this is the assertion of those who cleave our one Lord Jesus Christ into two natures. For, since
    the union in hypostasis is acknowledged, it follows that those which were united are not
    separated from one another; but there is one Son, and one nature of God the Word incarnate
    himself, as the holy Cyril also says in the work against Diodorus: "Let him know therefore that
    the body which was born at Bethlehem, even if it is not the same as the Word from God and the
    Father (I mean in natural characteristics), yet nevertheless became his, not anyone else's
    separate from the Son: and there is recognised to be one Son and Christ and Lord and Word who
    took flesh"<note type="footnote" n="10" resp="#ebrooks">Contr. Diod.,.fr. 17 (Cyr. in Jo. Ev.,
     ed. Pusey, III, p. 499).</note>. Those therefore who confess one incarnate nature of God the
    Word, and do not confuse the elements of which he consists, recognise also the propriety of
    those that were joined in union (and a property is that which <pb n="6"/> exists in the form of
    a manifestation of natural differences), and not that we should ascribe the acts of the manhood
    only to the human nature, and impute again those of the Godhead separately to God the Word, but
    they recognise the difference only, not admitting a division: for the principle of union does
    not admit of division. Hear what the holy and wise doctor Cyril says in the second volume<note
     type="footnote" n="11" resp="#ebrooks">
     <foreign xml:lang="grc">τόμος</foreign>.</note> of the work against the blasphemies of
    Nestorius: "For between Godhead and manhood I also allow that there is great distinction and
    distance. For the things which have been named on the principle of manner of existence are
    clearly different, and in no point like one another. But, when the mystery in Christ is
    introduced among us, the principle of union is not oblivious of difference", but rejects
    division, not by mixing or commingling the natures with one another, but that, after the Word of
    God has partaken of flesh and blood, he is even so understood and named as one Son"<note
     type="footnote" n="12" resp="#ebrooks">Adv. Nest., ii, 6 (ed. Pusey, VI, p. 113).</note>. But,
    if Emmanuel is one, consisting of Godhead and manhood which have a perfect existence according
    to their own principle, and the hypostatic union without confusion shows the difference of those
    which have been joined in one in dispensatory union, but rejects division, both the elements <pb
     n="7"/> which naturally belong to the manhood have come to belong to the very Godhead of the
    Word, and those which belong to the Word himself have come to belong to the very manhood which
    he hypostatically united to him. On this subject we will again adduce the sacred words of Cyril.
    In the prosphonetikon to the religious king Theodosius he spoke as follows: "As therefore it
    came to belong to the humanity to be the Only one, because it had been united to the Word in a
    dispensatory union, so it came to belong to the Word to be 'the first-born among many
     brethren'<note type="footnote" n="13" resp="#ebrooks"> Rom., viii, 29.</note>, because of the
    union with flesh"<note type="footnote" n="14" resp="#ebrooks">De rect. fide ad Theod. imp., 30
     (ed. Pusey, VII, p. 97).</note>. Gregory the Theologian<note type="footnote" n="15"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεολόγος</foreign>.</note> also in the letter to
    Gledonius wrote words which agree with him as follows: "As the natures are mingled, so also are
    the appellations; and they run into one another on the principle of coalescence"<note
     type="footnote" n="16" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 51 (P. G., XXXVII, 181).</note>. Do not let the term
    'mingle' disturb you: for he used it very clearly and without danger<note type="footnote" n="5"
     resp="#ebrooks"> </note> with the intention of denoting the primary union: for, where there is
    a union of something incorporeal with a body, no danger<note type="footnote" n="17"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνδυνος</foreign>.</note> anywhere arises from
    mingling. For this is manifestly a quality of fluid bodies, to be confounded together by
    intertwining, and, so to speak, come out of their nature. We therefore anathematize not <pb
     n="8"/> those who confess the properties of the natures of which the one Christ consists, but
    those who separate the properties, and apportion them to each nature apart. When the one Christ
    has once been divided (and he is divided by the fact that they speak of two natures after the
    union), with the natures which have been cut asunder into a duality and separated into a
    distinct diversity go the operations and properties which are the offspring of this division, as
    the words of Leo's impious letter state in what he said: "For each of the forms effects in
    partnership with the other that which belongs to itself, the Word doing that which belongs to
    the Word, and the body performing the things which belong to the body"<note type="footnote"
     n="18" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 28, 4 (P. L., LIV, 768).</note>. Against these things it is well to
    set the much-honoured words of the holy Cyril which refute impiety. In the Scholion about the
    coal he speaks as follows: "Nevertheless we may see in the coal as in a figure that God the Word
    was united to the manhood, but has not cast off being that which he is, but rather changed what
    had been assumed or united into his glory and operation. For, as fire when it takes hold of wood
    and is introduced into it, prevails over it, and does <pb n="9"/> not make it cease being wood,
    but rather changes it into the appearance and force of fire, and performs all its own acts in
    it, and is already reckoned as one with it, so understand in the case of Christ also. For, since
    God was ineffably united with manhood, he has preserved it as what we say it is, and he himself
    also has remained what he was. But, after he has once been united, he is reckoned as one with
    it, appropriating its qualities to himself, but he himself also carried on the operation of his
    nature in it"<note type="footnote" n="19" resp="#ebrooks">Schol. de Inc. Unig., 9 (ed. Pusey,
     VI, p. 51ff).</note>. If<note type="footnote" n="20" resp="#ebrooks">This passage as far as
     'operating' (p. 10, 1. 6) is cited in Mansi, XI, 444, where the letter is described as the 2nd
     to Oecumenius.</note> then the Word changed the manhood which he had hypostatically united to
    him, not into his nature, for he remained that which he was, but into his glory and operation,
    and things which manifestly belong to the flesh have come to belong to the Word himself, how
    shall we allow that each of the forms performs its own acts? But we must anathematize those who
    confine the one Christ in two natures and say that each of the natures performs its own acts.
    Between the things performed and done by the one Christ the difference is great. Some of them
    are acts befitting the divinity, while others are human. For example, to walk and travel in
    bodily form upon <pb n="10"/> the earth is without contention human; but to bestow on those who
    are maimed in the feet and cannot walk upon the ground at all the power of walking like sound
    persons is God-befitting. Yet the one Word incarnate performed the latter and the former, and
    the one nature did not perform the one, and the other the other; nor, because the things
    performed are different, shall we on this account rightly define two natures or forms as
    operating. Again the Tome of Leo says: "For each of the natures preserves its own property
    without diminution"<note type="footnote" n="21" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 28, 3 (P. L., LIV,
     766).</note>, distributing the properties to the two natures severally, as one who divides the
    one and only Christ into two natures. For the property of the natures of which Emmanuel
    consists, which is shown in the natural characteristics, continues constant and fixed, as the
    holy Cyril also says in the second letter to Succensus: "But, while each of them both remains
    and is perceived in the property which is. by nature, according to the principle which has just
    been enunciated by us, the ineffable and incomprehensible union has shown us one nature of the
    Son, yet, as I have said, an incarnate nature"<note type="footnote" n="22" resp="#ebrooks">Ep.
     46, 2 (P. G., LXXVII, 241).</note>. But God the Word did not permit his flesh in all things to
    undergo the passions proper to it, in order that its <pb n="11"/> property might be preserved
    undiminished, as the impious disputer said. For observe what the wise doctor Cyril says, in
    answer to the objections made by Theodoret, in the defence of the tenth anathema: "When the
    lowness arising from the exinanition seems hard to you, wonder greatly at the love of the Son
    toward us. For, what you say is a mean thing, this he did voluntarily for your sake. He wept in
    human fashion, that he might take away your weeping. He feared by dispensation, inasmuch as he
    sometimes permitted his flesh to undergo the passions proper to it, that he might make us
     valiant"<note type="footnote" n="23">Cyr., ed. Pusey, VI, p. 476.</note>. If he sometimes
    permitted his flesh by dispensation to undergo the passions proper to it, he did not preserve
    its property undiminished: for in many instances it is seen not to have undergone the things
    which manifestly belong to its nature; for it was united to the Word, the Maker of nature. The
    Word therefore who had become incarnate walked upon the sea, and after his death under the wound
    of the lance caused a stream of salvation to well forth from his side: again, after the
    Resurrection, he came in while the doors were shut, and appeared to the disciples in the house;
    whom he also allowed to touch him, showing that his flesh was tangible and solid, and of one
     essence<note type="footnote" n="24" resp="#ebrooks">
     <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> with us, and was also <pb n="12"/> superior to
    corruption; and thereby he subverted the theory of phantasy. It belongs therefore to those who
    part the one Christ into two natures and dissolve the unity to say, "For each of the natures
    preserves its property unimpaired". But those who believe that, after God the Word had been
    hypostatically united to flesh that possessed an intelligent soul, he performed all his own acts
    in it, and changed it not into his nature (far be it!), but into his glory and operation, no
    longer seek the things that manifestly belong to the flesh without diminution, to which flesh
    the things that manifestly belong by nature to the Godhead have come to belong by reason of the
    union. But, if they senselessly divide it from God the Word by speaking of two natures after the
    union, it then walks in its own ways following its nature, and preserves its properties
    undiminished on the principle of the impious men. But these things are not so (how could they
    be?), but indeed very different: for union rejects division, as the holy Cyril said: "For,
    though it is said that he hungered and thirsted, and slept and grew weary after a journey, and
    wept and feared, these things did not happen to him just as they do to us in accordance with
    compulsory ordinances of nature; but he <pb n="13"/> himself voluntarily permitted his flesh to
    walk according to the laws of nature, for he sometimes allowed it even to undergo its own
     passions"<note type="footnote" n="25" resp="#ebrooks">I cannot find the source of this
     citation.</note>. For from Cyril's words, as from a sacred anchor, I do not depart. And the
    same statement is made by Gregory the Theologian<note type="footnote" n="26" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεολόγος</foreign>.</note> of Nazianzus also in the sermon on
    baptism: "For he is purity itself, and did not need purification; but he is purified for you;
    just as for you he put on a garb of flesh, while he is fleshless: and he would have run no
    danger at all from putting off baptism; for he himself was a warden of passion to himself"<note
     type="footnote" n="27" resp="#ebrooks">Or. XL, 29.</note>. Accordingly then<note
     type="footnote" n="28" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρα</foreign>.</note> he was a
    warden to himself of hungering as well as of being tired after a journey, and of accepting the
    other human passions, such as do not fall under sin, in order to display the Humanization truly
    and without phantasy<note type="footnote" n="29"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >φαντασία</foreign>.</note>. Of what we have said this is the sum; that we must anathematize
    those who divide the one Christ: and they divide him by speaking of two natures after the union,
    and consequently apportioning the operations and properties between the natures. Accordingly
    good doctrine is contained in the<note type="footnote" n="30" resp="#ebrooks">I do not know what

   <p>I wonder how it is that your God-loving magnificence has picked <pb n="15"/> up again from the
    beginning the contention that had been put to silence. While confessing Emmanuel to be of two
    natures, to suppose the elements of which he consists to be generalities covering many
    hypostases (this is what is meant by the property of a generality) is a thing that is very
    abominable and inept, and one that confirms the charge falsely disseminated against us by the
    impious: for we are found to be imagining two natures before the union according to their
    account; for there would be the whole of humanity and of course the Godhead also, even before
    the Humanization of the Word. And these matters would need further conversation by word of
    mouth, not written words in a letter, which are subject to considerations of brevity, and bring
     danger<note type="footnote" n="32" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >κίνδυνος</foreign>.</note> to the writer, wherever any unusual name or unelaborated phrase is
    inserted in the document. You know what words that lead to rocks you have used in your recent
    composition, and, though admitting that you do this as a concession, you have still done it. But
    to us, who by ordinance from above and mercy have attained to this priestly office, it does not
    bring honour to take such ill expressions in our mouth and consign them to writing: for it is
    written, <pb n="16"/> "The lips of a priest will guard knowledge, and they will ask law from his
     mouth"<note type="footnote" n="33" resp="#ebrooks">Mal. ii, 7.</note>. Wherefore Paul also, who
    was taken up to the third heaven, and heard ineffable words<note type="footnote" n="34">2 Cor.
     xii, 2-4.</note>, knowing the difficulty of words of this kind, urged the believers to make
    earnest and constant prayer that speech might be granted him with eloquence<note type="footnote"
     n="35" resp="#ebrooks">Eph. vi, 19.</note>. Since then these things are so, and we decline to
    employ a multitude of words, which as a rule do not escape sin<note type="footnote" n="36"
     resp="#ebrooks">This perhaps represents <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμαρτεῖν</foreign> (to err):
     see p. 77, n. 3. </note>, I will use shortness of speech to your wisdom and knowledge, and ask
    you a very easy question. Do you call the flesh possessing an intelligent soul, which God the
    Word voluntarily united to himself hypostatically without any change, a specimen or a
    generality, that is one soul-possessing hypostasis, or the whole human generality? It is
    manifest that, if you wish to give a right-minded answer, you will say one soul-possessing body.
    Accordingly we say that from it and the hypostasis of God the Word the ineffable union was made:
    for the whole of the Godhead and the whole of humanity in general were not joined in a natural
    union, but special hypostases. And the holy and wise Cyril plainly witnesses to us in that in
     <pb n="17"/> the third chapter<note type="footnote" n="37" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαιον</foreign>.</note> or anathema he spoke thus: "Whoever divides the one
    Christ into hypostases after the union, associating them in association of honour or of
    authority only, and not rather in junction of natural union, let him be anathema"<note
     type="footnote" n="38" resp="#ebrooks">Mansi, IV, 1081.</note>. And again in the Scholia the
    same says: "Hence we shall learn that the hypostases have remained without confusion"<note
     type="footnote" n="39" resp="#ebrooks">Schol. de Inc. Unig., 11 (ed. Pusey, VI, p.
    520).</note>. Accordingly the natural union was not of generalities, but of hypostases of which
    Emmanuel was composed. And do not think that hypostases in all cases have a distinct person
    assigned to them, so that we should be thought, like the impious Nestorius, to speak of a union
    of persons, and to run counter to the God-inspired words of the holy Cyril, who in the second
    letter to the same Nestorius speaks thus: "But that it should be so<note type="footnote" n="40"
     resp="#ebrooks">Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὸ οὕτως ἔχειν</foreign>.</note> will in no way
    help the right principle of faith, even if some men spread about a union of persons. For the
    Scripture did not say that God the Word united to himself the person of a man, but that he
    became flesh"<note type="footnote" n="41" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr., ed. Pusey, VI, p. 8.</note>.
    When hypostases subsist by individual subsistence, as for instance, those of Peter and of Paul,
    whom the authority of the apostleship united, then there will be a union of persons and a
    brotherly association, not a natural junction <pb n="18"/> of one hypostasis made up out of two
    that is free from confusion. For this is what those who adhere to the foul doctrines of
    Nestorius are convicted of saying with regard to the divine Humanization also. They first make
    the babe exist by himself separately, so that a distinct person is even assigned to him, and
    then by attaching God the Word to him impiously introduce a union of persons into the faith.
    This Gregory the Theologian<note type="footnote" n="42" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >Θεολόγος</foreign>.</note> also rejected by saying in the great letter to Cledonius: "Whoever
    says that the man was formed, and God afterwards crept in is condemned: for this is not a birth
    of God, but an escape from birth"<note type="footnote" n="43" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 101 (P. G.,
     XXXVII, 177).</note>. But, when hypostases do not subsist in individual subsistence, as also in
    the case of the man among us, I mean him who is composed of soul and body, but are without
    confusion recognised in union and composition, being distinguished by the intellect only and
    displaying one hypostasis made out of two, such a union none will be so uninstructed as to call
    one of persons. Though the hypostasis of God the Word existed before, or rather<note
     type="footnote" n="44" resp="#ebrooks">
     <foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> was before all ages and times, being eternally
    with God both the Father and the Holy Spirit, yet still the flesh possessing an intelligent soul
    which he united to him did not exist <pb n="19"/> before the union with him, nor was a distinct
    person assigned to it<note type="footnote" n="45" resp="#ebrooks">This must be the meaning,
     though the grammar is awkward. Cf. p. 17, 1. 6 (text).</note>. And the great Athanasius bears
    witness, who in the letter to Jovinian the king says: "As soon as there is flesh, there is at
    once flesh of God the Word; and, as soon as there is soul-possessing and rational flesh<note
     type="footnote" n="46" resp="#ebrooks">Omitted in the printed Greek text.</note>, there is at
    once soul-possessing rational flesh of God the Word<note type="footnote" n="46" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Omitted in the printed Greek text.</note>: for in him also it acquired subsistence"<note
     type="footnote" n="47" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XXVIII, 531 (not in the genuine letter to
     Jovian).</note>. And the holy Cyril also testifies, addressing the impious Diodorus as follows:
    "My excellent man, I say that you are shooting forth unlearned words much affected with what is
    abhorrent. For the holy body was from Mary, but still at the very beginning of its concretion or
    subsistence in the womb it was made holy, as the body of Christ, and no one can see any time at
    which it was not his, but rather simple as you say and the same as this flesh of other men"<note
     type="footnote" n="48">Contr. Diod., fr. 15 (Cyr., in Jo. Ev., ed. Pusey, III, p. 498).</note>.
    Following these God-inspired words of the holy fathers, and confessing our Lord Jesus Christ to
    be of two natures, regard the distinct hypostases themselves of which Emmanuel was composed, and
    the natural junction of these, and do not go up to generalities and essences<note
     type="footnote" n="49"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσίας</foreign></note>, of the whole of the
    Godhead and humanity in <pb n="20"/> general: for it is manifest that the whole of the Godhead
    is seen in the Trinity, and humanity in general draws the mind to the whole human race. How
    therefore is it anything but ridiculous and impious for us to say that the Trinity was united in
    hypostasis to the race of mankind, when the holy Scriptures say more plainly than a trumpet,
    "The Word became flesh and dwelt in us"<note type="footnote" n="50" resp="#ebrooks">John 1,
     14.</note>, that is that one of the three hypostases who was rationally and hypostatically
    united to soul-possessing flesh? But neither do we deny, as we have also written in other
    letters on different occasions, that we often find men designating hypostases by the name of
     essence<note type="footnote" n="51" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note>. Hence Gregory the Theologian named hypostatic union union in
     essence<note type="footnote" n="51" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> in the letter to Cledonius which we have just mentioned, speaking
    thus: "Whoever says that he worked by grace as in a prophet, but not that he was united and
    fashioned together with him in essence, may he be bereft of the excellent operation, or rather
    may he be full of the contrary"<note type="footnote" n="52" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 101 (P. G.,
     XXXVII, 180).</note>. And the wise Cyril in the second letter to Succensus calls the manhood
    which was hypostatically united to God the Word essence<note type="footnote" n="51"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, saying: "For, if after saying
    'one nature <pb n="21"/> of the Word' we had stopped and not added 'incarnate', but set the
    dispensation as it were outside, they would perhaps in a way have a plausible argument when they
    pretend to ask, 'Where is the perfection in manhood? or how was the essence after our model made
    up?' But, since the perfection in manhood and the characteristic of our essence has been
    introduced by the fact that we said 'incarnate', let them be silent, since they have leaned upon
    the staff of a reed"<note type="footnote" n="53" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 46, 3 (P. G., LXXVII,

     denote the one hypostasis. But the very men who blasphemously call the one Christ two natures
     use the name 'nature' in place of 'individual designation', saying that the Word of God is one

     of things which are the opposite of their evil opinions, and to charge us with holding some
     mixture or blending or confusion or phantasy in the divine and ineffable Humanization, after
     common deliberation we have decided to make clear by a limitation and distinction what was
     stated by you without limitation. You say of the mystery of Christ that you do not recognise
     the difference of the natures, nor yet their individuality, since with 'difference' you
     understand also 'division'. Hence also you clearly laid down the following by way of a canon:
     "When therefore we seek to separate and distinguish rational nature from irrational, and
     suprasensual from perceptible, and created from uncreated, together with the difference between
     these things we also make a separation and division". These statements have been made by you as
     well and wisely as possible, that, where there is rational and irrational, or perceptible and
     suprasensual, or created arid uncreated, each of them remains by itself, and appears in its own
     hypostasis, that is, has an individual and separate and distinct existence; for here with
     difference is understood also division, and again from the difference of the qualities which
     naturally belong to each singly we recognise <pb n="31"/> division. When therefore out of
     things that differ in kind and are not of one essence<note type="footnote" n="75"
      resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> with one another, the
     suprasensual I mean and the perceptible, a combination or natural union takes place in order to
     make up one animal, as we see in the case of a man, the division into two ceases, for of this
     the notion of unity does not admit, but the difference and individuality as it were in the
     natural characteristics of the elements which have come together into one is preserved, since
     the body has not refused to be body, nor has the soul passed into the nature of the body. The

    <p>But, since you have thought fit to ask me what is the difference that appears in natural
     characteristics, I mean of the natures from which Emmanuel is, I will explain clearly and not
     conceal. (And a little farther on.) For <pb n="32"/> Cyril the truly holy and wise after
     writing in the letter to Acacius, "Godhead and manhood are not the same thing in respect of
     natural characteristics"<note type="footnote" n="77" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 40 (P. G., LXXVII,

     follows, as if explaining the meaning of the expression: "For between Godhead and manhood I
     also allow that there is great distinction and distance: for the things which have been named
     are clearly different, and in no point like one another"<note type="footnote" n="79"
      resp="#ebrooks">Adv. Nest., ii, 6 (ed. Pusey, VI, p. 113).</note>. This then is the difference

       >κατά γε τὸν τοῦ πῶς εἷναι λόγον</foreign>, which clause the translator has omitted above,

     uncreated, and bodiless, and intangible, while the other is created, and subject to beginning,

    <p>It was sufficient to banish this unseemly supposition, that 'difference <pb n="33"/> in
     characteristics' was not stated absolutely, but the word 'natural' was added, which declares
     the fact that it is only by the intellect and by subtle investigation that we can know of what
     kind each of the natures is which have combined in the unity and made up one hypostasis and
     manifestly declare that Emmanuel is one out of two opposite things, Godhead I mean and manhood,
     as Gregory the Theologian<note type="footnote" n="81" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

    <p>How then, after these things have been written by me, is it not plain to everyone from the
     words used by the wise Cyril that division also is then understood to accompany difference,
     when the separate natures or hypostases exist individually, not when one person and one
     incarnate nature or hypostasis of God the Word is made up by coalescence from two? That the
     holy Cyril says that separation or division is then joined with difference <pb n="34"/> when
     the natures exist apart and by themselves is testified by the addition made to the words cited

    <p>And do not tell me that the holy Cyril alone used the expression in this sense; but observe
     with sound intelligence that he does not step outside the apostolic faith; for Gregory the
     Theologian also spoke words that are in accord with him in the passage which we have just cited
     above. And, if none of the God-clad fathers before him in fact spoke in so many words of unity
     in hypostasis with reference to the Incarnation of God the Word, yet still all the lovers of
     the right faith accepted it, inasmuch as it sets forth the splendour of the mystery of the
     divine Humanization, and it agrees with the opinion of the doctors of the church. Therefore
     also that wretched and impious Theodoret speaks thus in the objection to the 2nd anathema:
     "Unity in hypostasis we do not recognise at all, as being strange and alien to the divine

    the fact that he is unbegotten; and the Son again has one thing hypostatically, sonship, and the
    fact that he was begotten by the Father; and the Holy Spirit again has one thing, the fact that
    he was not begotten, but proceeds eternally without beginning from the Father: for in virtue of
    these things distinctness of person belongs to each one of them, that is, is marked out and
    defined for the hypostases, but all the other attributes are, as I have said, common, equal in
    honour and undivided, and such as show that we for our part have believed in one God, and in one

    time, and their ascent is to him, as to a root and source, and from him they are, though they
    are not after him. And for this reason, while we confess three hypostases, we do not believe in
    three first causes, but one first cause, and one kingship. After pursuing the matter so far we
    praise only and do not investigate what the unbegottenness of the Father is, or what the
    generation of the Son is, or what the procession of the Holy Spirit is; for these things are
    known only by the Father who begot and the Son who was begotten, and the Holy Spirit who

     about interpretations. There after examining the question why the Lord came to baptism when he
     was 30 years of age in the flesh I said at one time that it was in order to show that the new
     birth begets men full-grown in reasonable age, for so also the first man was created
     full-grown, and immediately as full-grown received a commandment and a law, and was given
     permission to till and keep Paradise, and the words which follow<note type="footnote" n="113"
      resp="#ebrooks">Mai, Class. Auct., X, 415. The 2nd reason is not in the printed text.</note>;
     and at another that by means of three periods comprised in three decads which make 30 years he
     signified the mystery that was revealed on the Jordan, that one Godhead is made known in three
     complete hypostases, by which holy baptism in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit was to
     be performed. That these things introduce no confusion Gregory the Theologian in the sermon on
     the Passover states as follows: "The Lord's passion<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Greg.
       <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάσχα</foreign>, which the translator has misunderstood.</note>, the
      passion<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Greg. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάσχα</foreign>,

      has misunderstood.</note>, in honour of the Holy Trinity"<note type="footnote" n="115"
      resp="#ebrooks">Or. XLV, 2.</note>; though I know that no other <pb n="49"/> undertook the
     saving passion on our behalf in the flesh except God the Word, who became incarnate for our
     race. For the whole of the saving Humanization has this effect, that the mystery of the Holy
     Trinity is revealed to us, although you speak of the birth in flesh, or of the Gross or of the
     burial, or of the Resurrection from among the dead, dividing the Humanization into many
     elements. For indeed in each of these we confess that we know the Trinity, in that we indicate
     upon our faces that the sign of the revered Cross is a dissolver of every evil influence; and,
     when therefore we sign ourselves, we sign three times, and we show that it is through the Gross
     that we have obtained knowledge in the Trinity. And this sign is a thing which makes known and
     completes all things that are done among Christians; and it is everywhere adopted, at the
     performance of baptism, at the consecration of water, at the celebration of the rational,
     spiritual sacrifice, and at the symbolic and ineffable ordinations to the priesthood of those
     who are duly appointed to the sacred ministry, though in all these things we do not call upon
     one of the hypostases only, that is God the Word who <pb n="50"/> was humanized, but on the
     three together, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, indicating that it is by the power of

   <p>To those who are not wise in their mind or are otherwise without intelligence, and are lacking
    in true instruction, the holy Scripture gives the proper rule and place, in order that their
    emptiness of mind and lack of instruction may be turned to wisdom: for indeed it commands those
    who are such both to learn and to ask, or to be silent altogether; for the holy book <pb n="51"

    maketh himself silent, he is thought to be wise"<note type="footnote" n="120" resp="#ebrooks">

    learn things that are of use and profit, and it says, "Give thine heart to wisdom, and prepare
    thine ears for words of understanding"<note type="footnote" n="121" resp="#ebrooks">Prov. xxiii,
     12.</note>. I am surprised therefore that the brother whom you mention (out of tenderness for
    his soul I do not mention his name) did not know his own measure, and, besides not knowing
    originally the subject on which he was talking, neglected this legally established and salutary
    rule; and, when he ought to have bent a ear of understanding to those who are wiser than he is,
    he on the contrary threatened to take the ignorance that is in him to the city of Alexandria,
    like an invincible warrior, who is able to overcome and take captive all that meet him, and sell
    them where he likes. Therefore I have both accepted your wisdom in the Lord, which is worthy of

    errors, and you behaved like doctors and churchmen, and on all sides seek to gain his salvation,
    and by actual deeds show that you look to the apostolic commandment which commands, "Let
    everything be done decently and in order"<note type="footnote" n="123" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor.
     xiv, 40.</note>, but he, though he was thought worthy to receive so much attention, had no

    expressed blame and at the same time showed mercy and still show mercy, since ignorance is free
    from danger<note type="footnote" n="124"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνδυνος</foreign>.</note>, for
    a man is not blamed because he does not know. He is trying to bring upon himself the sin that
    does not deserve forgiveness, in that he does not yield to those who are wise among the
    brethren, or seek from wiser men a cure for his ignorance by desire to learn, but pettily
    searches into things that are unknown and uncertain, and does his best to find men to share his
    opinions, in order that he may seem to be saying something when he is saying nothing that is
    sound. But the other things which he said without <pb n="53"/> knowledge he has with difficulty
    come to honour by silence, in that he assented to the passages from the holy fathers (that were
    brought before him; and he was reduced to one passage, the words used by the holy Cyril in the
    second volume<note type="footnote" n="125" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

    because the Word who is from God the Father took flesh and came forth as a man like us, he would

    divine doctrine, he should have (to omit everything else) considered the anathemas of Gregory
    the Theologian, who in the great letter to Cledonius which begins, 'I wonder what this
    innovation is', clearly lays down these principles in it, "If anyone says that the flesh<note
     type="footnote" n="134" resp="#ebrooks">Sev. therefore did not read <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἁγίαν</foreign>: see Migne, n. 40.</note> was now laid down by him, and the Godhead is
    stripped of a body, and does not confess that he both is and will come with the thing assumed
    itself, may he not see the glory of his coming. For where is the body now except with him who
    assumed it? For it has not been laid up in the sun, as the silly tale of the Manichees goes, in
    order that he may be honoured through the object of contempt, or diffused and dissolved in the
    air, like the nature of a voice and the wafting of a smell, and the course of lightning that
    does not stand still. But what becomes of the fact that he was actually touched after the
    Resurrection, or that he will again some time <pb n="55"/> be seen by those who pierced him? For
    the Godhead by itself is invisible. But he will come with the body, according to my account, and
    such as he was seen by, or was shown to, the disciples on the mount, inasmuch as the Godhead
    easily overcomes the flesh"<note type="footnote" n="135" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 101 (P. G., XXXVII,
     181).</note>. Who.that reads these words resplendent with truth, and flashing with the rays of
    the Holy Spirit, will dare to say that the Word of God, who was humanized immutably and without
    any phantasy<note type="footnote" n="136" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φαντασία</foreign>.</note>, is without flesh after the inexplicable and incomprehensible
    union? Accordingly it is clear that you also have not gone beyond what is fitting in opposing
    the precipitous error of that man and saying in order to remove him from this error, "The words
    used by the doctor about the Word of God, In his own nature he is without flesh and blood',
    refer to the time before the Humanization". Indeed, since he himself said that 'he is one, and
    not without flesh', how can it be anything but wholly unreasonable, and presumptuous and
    irreverent, for us to gainsay this, and contend that he is without <pb n="56"/> flesh? But the
    words which he went on to add, 'who in his own nature is without flesh and blood', plainly
    introduce this thought, that in his own nature, that is in the Godhead, he has no association
    with flesh and blood. He did not take the flesh into the fulness of his own divine nature and
    mix it with it, nor did he mingle it with his own Godhead, but that in the dispensatory
    assumption we might understand him to be not without flesh, Emmanuel being wonderfully composed
    and consisting of two elements, the Godhead and the manhood: but even so he preserved the
    absence, of mixture in the divine essence<note type="footnote" n="1" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, and did not change the essence<note type="footnote"
     n="137" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of the Godhead into the
    nature of flesh. And that this is so I bring as a witness to the accuracy of his doctrines the
    doctor himself, who by the operation of the Holy Spirit is an accurate doctor. In the first
    letter to Succensus, when certain men had advanced a similar objection, he expressed himself
    thus: "Since I found in <pb n="57"/> the memorial an assertion of this kind stated, that since
    the Resurrection the holy body of Christ the Saviour of us all has passed into the nature of the
    Godhead, so as to be all Godhead only, I thought it right to speak against this also". And
    thereupon, after he has above in a brief compass gone through all the statement of the
    dispensation of the Humanization, he brings against it this argument: "It is impossible for a
    body taken from earth to endure the change into the divine nature. And, if not, we bring against
    the Godhead the charge that it is as a thing that is made and as a thing that has taken into it
    something that is not its by nature"<note type="footnote" n="138" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 45 (P. G.,
     LXXVII, 233, 236).</note>. See! how plainly he denies that the divinity of the Word has taken
    anything into its essence<note type="footnote" n="139" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> which is not its by nature, though we confess that flesh possessing
    an intelligent soul was taken by God the Word, and he united this to him hypostatically, but not
    so that anything should be added to his divine essence<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, as if it were deficient (for he is truly
    complete in everything), but that from the unmixed union of the Incarnation, and the composition
    out of two elements, the Godhead <pb n="58"/> and the manhood, Emmanuel should be made up, who
    in one hypostasis is ineffably composite; not simple, but composite: as the soul of a man like
    us, which by nature is bodiless and rational, which is naturally intertwined with the body,
    remains in its suprasensual and bodiless nature, but by reason of the composition with the body
    makes up one composite animal, man. Accordingly the assumption of the body makes no addition to
    the essence<note type="footnote" n="140" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of the soul, but makes up the composite animal, as it is reasonable to
    understand with regard to the theory<note type="footnote" n="141" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign>.</note> of Emmanuel also. The Word did not take the flesh
    intelligently possessed of a soul in order to complete his being God, as we have said, but that
    one hypostasis might be wonderfully and immutably made up out of two elements, the Godhead we
    mean and the manhood, and the one incarnate nature of the Word himself, and one person: for the
    Word of God, according to the saying of Paul the apostle, partook of blood and flesh after our
     pattern<note type="footnote" n="142">Hebr., 11, 14.</note>. And that this is so the approved
    Cyril further shows in the letter to Valerian bishop of Iconium; who wrote as follows: "For God
    and man did not come together, as they say, and make up <pb n="59"/> one Christ; but, as I have
    already said, the Word, being God, partook of blood and flesh like us, in order that he may be
    known to be God who was humanized, and who took our flesh, and made this his, because, as the
    man who was composed of soul and body is known to be one, so also now<note type="footnote"
     n="143" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὑτός</foreign>.</note> he is acknowledged
    to be one Son and Lord. For one nature and hypostasis of a man is acknowledged, though he is
    known to be made of diverse and heterogeneous elements: for the body is truly different in
    nature from the soul; but it belongs to it, and with it makes up the hypostasis of the one man.
    And in mental conception and in theory the difference of the things that have been named is not
    obscure, but by combination and concurrence that cannot be cut asunder one animal, man, is made
    up. The Word therefore, the Only one of God, did not come forth as man by taking a man, but,
    though his birth from the Father is ineffable, he became man by forming a man<note
     type="footnote" n="144" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ναόν</foreign>.</note> for
    himself through the Holy Spirit which is of one essence with him. Accordingly he is known to be
    one, though in the theory which is according to reason his own body is different in nature from
    himself. Let it therefore be everywhere acknowledged that he was not without soul, but that he
    was possessed of an intelligent soul"<note type="footnote" n="145" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 50 (P.
     G., LXXVII, 257).</note>. Similarly also in the second volume<note type="footnote" n="146"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">τόμος</foreign>.</note>
    <pb n="60"/> against the blasphemies of Nestorius he clearly teaches that the assumption of
    flesh did not pass into the Godhead of the Word, but that the Word of God remained in his own
    nature, and apart from flesh, but by the immutable combination with flesh it was wisely and
    beyond all reason and understanding brought about that one Christ should be marvellously made
    up; for he speaks thus: "Accordingly confess one, not dividing the natures, while you know and
    understand that to flesh belongs one principle, and to Godhead that which befits it only. For we
    do not say that the flesh of the Word became Godhead, but rather that it is divine as being his.
    For, as the flesh of a man is called his, on what ground is it not right for us also to call
    that of the Word divine?" And again farther on: "If therefore he were a wise and intelligent man
    at all, he should say that the body is from a woman, but confess besides that by being combined
    in hypostatic union with the Word it has made up one Christ and one Son, and one Lord, who being
    the same is God and man"<note type="footnote" n="147" resp="#ebrooks">Adv. Nest., ii, 8, 13 (ed.
     Pusey, VI, p. 120, 130). </note>. The expressions therefore that are used by this genuine and
    very accurate father, 'for he is one, and not without flesh', and, 'he who in his own nature is
    apart from flesh and blood', demonstrate <pb n="61"/> this, as is plain from what we have
    demonstrated, that in the dispensatory conjunction he is not without flesh: for he is one
    composed of two elements, the Godhead and the manhood, which have a perfect existence in their
    own sphere; but in his own nature he is known to be apart from flesh and blood, and without a
    body; not that he mingled flesh with the nature or with the essence<note type="footnote" n="148"
     resp="#ebrooks"> </note> of the Godhead, but that he kept the Godhead sublime and pure and
    unmixed, in the characteristics of its own incorporeal character, as also he did not change the
    manhood which was hypostatically united to him, but kept it free and without change in its own
    characteristics. Wherefore also one may see that Nestorius and those who like Jews hold his
    opinions wish to reject the absence of change of the hypostatic union, and to put confusion into
    the minds of the believers, while they are everywhere making this charge, that we confess that
    the body was changed into the divine essence<note type="footnote" n="1" resp="#ebrooks">
     <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, and thereby hold one incarnate nature of God
    the Word, and they say that they themselves only, the wretched, unhappy men, keep the Godhead of
    the holy Trinity unmixed and pure, by confessing that the man from Mary, as they themselves say,
    in loving mercy was conjoined to <pb n="62"/> God the Word and shares with him in sonship and
    divine authority, and by this self-created scruple<note type="footnote" n="149" resp="#ebrooks"
     >This represents <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐθελοθρησκεία</foreign> (Col., ii, 23).</note> they
    make the Trinity a quaternity. And for this reason the wise Cyril shows Nestorius also, who was
    their leader in this fatuity, speaking thus: "Therefore God the Word is named Christ also,
    because he has the eternal conjunction with Christ, and God the Word cannot do anything without
    the manhood: for he knows the coalescence exactly<note type="footnote" n="150" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Cyr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπηκρίβωται γάρ εἰς ἄκραν συνάφειαν</foreign>.</note>, not with
    the Godhead, as the new wise men amoug the doctors say"<note type="footnote" n="151"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ibid., 7 (ed. Pusey, VI," p. 116).</note>. And the same man of small intellect
    weaves the same charge, and in the treatise entitled 'Against the Theopaschites or Cyrillians',
    which he composed in the form of question and answer, speaks thus: "The Theopaschite says: 'And
    how can we be accused of the composition of the Diphysites, we who call Christ one incarnate
    nature of God?'</p>
   <p>The orthodox<note type="footnote" n="152" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

    refutes. For you have confessed that one nature is prepared for Christ, from incorporeality and
    a body, and a hypostasis with one nature <pb n="63"/> of the incarnation of the Godhead. But
    this is the confusion of those who have two natures, that the natures themselves are deprived of
    the hypostases which they severally possess, that are confounded with one another'"<note

   <p>And again farther on in the same treatise:</p>
   <p>"The Theopaschite says: 'What do you think of an eggshell (?) of water that has been poured

    has disappeared in the great volume of the sea?'</p>
   <p>The Theopaschite says: 'Something similar happened also to the flesh: for do not think that
    the Godhead is smaller than the sea in relation to the flesh as compared with the shifting

   <p>The orthodox<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

   <p>While very vainly putting together such reasons against the right confession of the
    Humanization, as I said before, reasons which contend against God, and saying that a man should
    be worshipped with the Trinity, Nestorius and those who think with him state of themselves that
    they preserve the unity of nature of the three hypostases unmixed, in that they do not confess
    that God the Word was hypostatically united to flesh possessing an intelligent soul, and call
    the union that is so far above nature and immutable and wonderful mingling. Wherefore also
    Dorotheus, who became bishop of Marcianopolis<note type="footnote" n="158" resp="#ebrooks">
     Zach. Rh., iii, 1; P. O., VIII, 83 L; G. B. M., p. 553, 927, 956, 967; Le Quien, I,

    Marcian's own self at the very beginning of his reign, and found fault with the position<note
     type="footnote" n="159" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κατάστασις</foreign>.</note>
    held by the bishops, and the sound opinion of the holy churches; and he speaks thus: "Therefore,
    merciful kings, in consideration of their so ridiculous, that is lamentable, opinions, renew the
    firm maintenance of the connaturality while it is possible, while there is time, by recalling
    Nestorius from exile<note type="footnote" n="160" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἐξορία</foreign>.</note>, and join together the people of Christ who are divided, lest, <pb

     resp="#ebrooks">Not otherwise known. Citations from the letter are found in G 53 ro b and L 24
     ro b.</note>. The holy Cyril therefore, having exposed such old people's fables and Jewish
     tales<note type="footnote" n="162" resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim. iv, 7; Tit., i, 14.</note> in every
    part of his writings, in the first letter to Succensus also, which I mentioned above, said thus:
    "But it is impossible for a body taken from earth to endure the change into the divine nature;
    for it cannot be done. And, if not, we speak of the Godhead as a thing that is made, and as a
    thing that has taken into it something that is not its by nature. For on the score of
    impropriety it is equal for us to say that the body was changed into the nature of Godhead, and
    also the other thing too that the Word was changed into the nature of flesh. For, as this is
    impossible (for he is invariable and immutable), so also is the other. For it is not among
    possibilities that any created thing can pass into the essence or nature of Godhead. But the
    body too is a created thing. Accordingly we say that Christ's body is divine, because it is also
    God's body, and resplendent with ineffable glory, incorruptible, holy, life-giving: but, that it
    was changed into the nature <pb n="66"/> of Godhead, none of the holy fathers has either thought
    or said, nor do we ourselves so hold"<note type="footnote" n="163" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 45 (P.
     G., LXXVII, 23(5).</note>. This fact therefore according to the expression of the doctor, that
    the body of the Word is resplendent with ineffable glory, incorruptible and holy and
    life-giving, Gregory the Theologian also in the demonstration contained in the letter to
    Gledonius demonstrated by saying that the Godhead overcame the incarnation<note type="footnote"
     n="164" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 101 (P. G,.. XXXVII, 181).</note>. Accordingly the flesh remained
    flesh, even after the God-befitting Resurrection and Ascension, but adorned with divine and
    ineffable glory, and with all the excellencies that befit God; and it is divine as something
    that is the body of God, and it was not changed into the essence<note type="footnote" n="165"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of the Godhead. It is in this
    meaning that the expression of the doctor with which we are now concerned also should rightly be
    understood that God the Word is one and not without flesh: for he is incarnate by hypostatic
    union in flesh possessing an intelligent soul (but in his own nature he is without flesh and
    blood), that is, without mixture <pb n="67"/> with what he possesses in his essence<note
     type="footnote" n="166" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and
    nature, that is the bodiless and immutable and incomprehensible Godhead.</p>
   <p>As for what you say at the end that the man who easily follows illusions (?) <note
     type="footnote" n="167" resp="#ebrooks">The best emendation of an impossible text that I can
     make. </note> and shifts his ground widely said on the advice of certain persons, that we must
    think of the Word of God in the infinity of his divine essence<note type="footnote" n="166"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> without flesh, is very foolish
    and senseless. Even though the Word of God is infinite, the whole of him was united to the flesh
    that was received from the holy Virgin, the God-bearer and ever-virgin Mary, even the very
    person of the Word and not a partial operation as in the prophets. How then is it anything but
    ridiculous for us to say that he who was in the actual divine hypostasis wholly united to a body
    naturally as well as miraculously is without flesh, even in the greatness of his infinite
     Godhead<note type="footnote" n="168" resp="#ebrooks"> (C) 'infinity'.</note>? For 'there is no
    limit to his greatness'<note type="footnote" n="169" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. CXLIV, 3.</note>, as
    David said, and he fills everything, and is above everything, and cannot be comprised by anyone.
    And the subtlety of <pb n="68"/> the mystery cannot be explored by reason and intellect, how the
    whole of him was in flesh, and the whole of him is in all things and the whole of him is
    superior to all things and he himself is Ruler of all in infinity. But, that we believe that the
    very hypostasis of God the Word became incarnate, according to the apostolic tradition of the
    church that has been handed down from of old, it is superfluous for us to demonstrate by
    testimonies to those who have once believed in the Gospel, when John who was divine in words
    beyond the evangelists said, "The Word became flesh and came to dwell in us"<note
     type="footnote" n="170" resp="#ebrooks">John I, 14.</note>. How ever, since there is a doubt
    about it, and in order that we may close the doors against all contention, on this point too let
    the words of the father himself, I mean the holy Cyril, come to our assistance, who in the
    defence of the second chapter<note type="footnote" n="171" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαιον</foreign>.</note> addressed to Theodoret the deceiver wrote thus:
    "Since Nestorius therefore everywhere eliminates the birth in flesh, and introduces among us a
    union of authority only, and says that a man was conjoined to God, who is honoured by identity
    of name of sonship, in contending against his propositions we were compelled to say that the
    hypostatic union took place, in which expression <pb n="69"/> the word 'hypostatic' denotes
    nothing else except this only, that the nature itself or his hypostasis, which is the Word
    himself, after it has been united to human nature without variation and confusion, as we have
    often said, is recognised as one Christ [and] is so, the same God and man"<note type="footnote"
     n="172" resp="#ebrooks"> Cyr., ed. Pusey, VI, p. 404.</note>. After the same fashion in the
    Scholia also he comes forward with the same words as follows: "'For in him dwelt all the fulness
    of the Godhead bodily', that is not by assumption simply<note type="footnote" n="173"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἁπλῶς</foreign>.</note>, like light that shines, or
    fire that imparts its heat [to] the objects near it, but, if we may so say, that the divine and
    incontaminable nature itself by a true union as I have said made the temple from the Virgin a
    dwelling-place for that which he is recognised to be. For thus Christ Jesus is recognised to be
     one"<note type="footnote" n="174" resp="#ebrooks">Schol. de Inc. Unig., 27 (ed. Pusey, VI, p.
     550); in Latin only.</note>. But, that the whole of him was in a body, and was hypostatically
    united to it, him of whom all things were divinely full, he himself confirms by his own words.
    For it is written in the Gospel of John also that he said to Nicodemus, "No man hath gone up to
    heaven, except him who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven"<note
     type="footnote" n="175" resp="#ebrooks">John iii, 13.</note>; though he did not come down from
    heaven in that he became man, for he did not bring the flesh down from <pb n="70"/> heaven, but
    he received it from the holy Virgin, flesh that is of our race, and of our nature. Nor again,
    when he was speaking to Nicodemus, was he corporeally in heaven; but incorporeally, in that he
    is God, heaven and earth and what is above heaven were perpetually full of him. And in the
    eighth section of the second of the books against<note type="footnote" n="176" resp="#ebrooks"
     >The Syriac is corrupt and the emendation doubtful.</note> Julian the great in demon-worship,
    which were written by him in defence of the Christian religion, the doctor shows how the Word of
    God, while he is all in all, was hypostatic ally united to the flesh derived from the holy Mary,
    and, beyond every creature, filled all things by reception from him (in a suprasensual sense
    nothing is empty of him), though the infinity of his greatness surpasses and soars above all
    things that exist with a great space between (how great it is impossible to say): by whom
    according to the words of Isaiah "all the nations have been reckoned as a drop from a pot, and
    as the sand of a balance"<note type="footnote" n="177" resp="#ebrooks">Is. XL, 15. </note>. But
    the holy Cyril again speaks thus: "He has become, as I said, in the likeness of men, as it is
    written, and in our human appearance truly. Nevertheless we did not say that he who cannot be
    comprised was <pb n="71"/> confined, nor that he was inclosed in the limits of the body. For it
    is utterly silly and complete folly to say anything of the kind of him who is by nature and in
    truth God. For, while he is one and the only Son, and completely above all human phantasy, the
    whole of him is in virtue of a gift in every man, and in each [one] by presence, not being
    divided nor cleft asunder, but [above] everything by nature, and in everything as God. 'But in
    that all-pure and holy body 'all the fulness of the Godhead bodily has come to dwell', as it is
    written. And he was as in his own flesh, but still even so he filled all things from him"<note
     type="footnote" n="178" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., LXXVI, 940.</note>. And in the treatise
    addressed to the queens the opening words of which are, Those who administer the divine and
    heavenly preaching', he explains the meaning of the statement that the Word of God and all the
    fulness of the Godhead came to dwell in flesh as written by Paul in this way: "But we believe
    that the Word became flesh, not by way of removal or change, but rather that he came to dwell in
    us, and, to speak correctly, made the body that was in truth united <pb n="72"/> to him,
    possessing an intelligent soul, his own temple. And the divine Paul, declaring the indwelling of
    the Word in the holy flesh, or the true union, said that in him all the fulness of the Godhead
    came to dwell, not so much by way of assumption or presence, or by way of a gift of grace, but
    bodily, that is in essence; as in the case of a man also it is said [that] his spirit dwells in
    him, though it is not something different from him"<note type="footnote" n="179" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Ad regin., 14 (ed. Pusey, VII, p. 285).</note>. How then shall we say [that] he who is wholly
    in everything by way of gift, and in each man in presence (for he receives all things from him
    and they depend upon his presence), and who further also is in everything and is nowhere cleft
    asunder or divided, and further is wholly in the all-holy flesh in essence, and so is united to
    it, after the fashion in which the soul of a man like us is united to its own body, how shall we
    say that he is without his own flesh, because he filled all these things with the gift of
    himself, he who is infinite, and is wholly in everything? But to inquire into such a marvellous
    subject is a piece of utter foolishness: for glorious things are sealed by faith only. In the
    other treatise addressed to the religious virgin queens, Arcadia and Marina, which begins, 'The
    world's boast', the same wise Cyril <pb n="73"/> inserted a demonstration from the holy John who
    became bishop of Constantinople, who spoke about the God-bearer Mary, and about the birth of God
    the Word, as follows: "'And instead of a sun she contained without confining the Sun of
    righteousness. And do not ask how: for, where God wills, the order of nature is defeated. For he
    willed, he was able, he came down, and he saved. All things run into one for God. To-day he who
    is is born, and he who is became that which he was not. For, being God, he became man, not by
    departing from being God; for he did not became man by departure from Godhead, nor did he become
    God by growth from man: but, being the Word, he became flesh on account of suffering<note
     type="footnote" n="180" resp="#ebrooks">Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ τὸ
     ἀπαθές</foreign>.</note>, while he remained invariable in his nature'. And he adds to these
    things: 'He who sits upon a lofty and high throne is laid in a manger. He who is intangible and
    simple and bodiless is grasped by human hands. He who cuts asunder the bonds of sin is wrapped
    in swaddling-clothes'"<note type="footnote" n="181" resp="#ebrooks">Jo. Chrys. ed. Par. 2a, VI,
     459; Cyr., ed. Pusey, VII, p. 165.</note>. And the saintly Proclus who became bishop of the
    same city in the exposition which he delivered in the church of Anthimus on the feast of the
    Resurrection spoke to the same effect as follows: "The heaven <pb n="74"/> cries, 'He who became
    man, who was crucified in flesh, is God: for as God he caused me to incline and came down'. The
    sun also cries, 'He who was crucified in flesh is my Lord: for I in fear of the light of the
    Godhead held-back my rays'. The earth also cries, 'He who clothed himself in a body, who was
    crucified in flesh, is the Maker: for, though I embraced his flesh in a manger, yet I did not
    confine the might of his Godhead'"<note type="footnote" n="182" resp="#ebrooks">Or. xiii. 4 (P.
     G., LXV, 793).</note>. It would have been possible to add other things also which are like
    these and resemble them, but it is superfluous to add to what has been so wisely said, and make
    the discussion inordinately long. But I pray your holy assembly and lawful church to be of the
    same mind, as the apostle said<note type="footnote" n="183" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. xiii,
     11.</note>, and conform to the same rule<note type="footnote" n="184" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">κανών</foreign>.</note>, and, if any disputed point arises, not make this a
    cause of strife and division, and of useless contentions, but lovingly join with one another in
    the inquiry. But, if any of you has anything to say, let him speak with humble mind, as the
    words of God, as Peter the 'chosen apostle gave admonition<note type="footnote" n="185"
     resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. iv, 11.</note>. If anything also needs further explanation, you must not
    act hastily, nor be in a hurry, but await the proper time, and bring it before the saintly
    bishops, and accept the healing that they shall apply. As for <pb n="75"/> the brother who gave
    occasion for this dispute, since we have written these few words, receive him lovingly, and
    strengthen him, and acknowledge him as your member. And, whether he is one man, or many who were
    associated with him in this dispute or ignorance, act in the same way towards them: for
    concerning those who are such the apostle commands us and says, at one time, "Him that is weak
    in the faith bring near to you"<note type="footnote" n="186" resp="#ebrooks">Rom. xiv,
    1.</note>, and at another, "And reckon them not as enemies, but admonish them as brothers"<note
     type="footnote" n="187" resp="#ebrooks">2 Thess. iii, 5.</note>. It is not because they made
    inquiries, or because they were ignorant that they are blameworthy; on the contrary they would
    actually have been praised, if they had discussed the point with humility, and not with haste
    and confusion, and with a desire to add to ignorance; for this is what prevented them from being
    received in regard to the discussion which they raised. However, now that we have written so
    much, let love vanquish everything, and let not these distressing matters come even into
    remembrance: for 'love' also, as it is written, 'covers a multitude of sins'<note
     type="footnote" n="188" resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. iv, 8.</note>; which love may the God of love
    and the lawgiver Christ also strengthen in you. <pb n="76"/>

      this citation.</note>. And we see the divine Scripture also saying of each created thing, "Let
     there be light, and there was light; and God saw the light that it was good"; and again, "Let
     there be so-and-so and there was; and God saw that it was good"; and after everything together

     a sin on God's part? If so be they are a sin, they are not good: but, if they are good, they

    <p>But, my good friend, neither indeed did God make the world in order that it might be
     corrupted, for 'salutary are the creations of the world', as you have heard; but, since it is
     of a very fluid nature, he on the contrary brought it into being in order that it might partake
     of incorruption; for indeed 'even creation itself shall be freed from the bondage of corruption
     into the freedom of the glory of the children of God'. For what logic is it, tell me, that
     rational man who sinned of his own accord should according to your argument be raised to
     incorruption, while creation which is inanimate and without perception, which for his sake was
     made subject to vanity, should be delivered to final destruction, and not partake of the
     incorruptibility and the glory of those for whose sake it was made <pb n="80"/> subject to
     corruption? For that the world shall be consummated is manifest according to the faith in the
     divine Scriptures: for that the rudiments which compose this visible creation will not pass
     into absolute non-existence, but will be changed into something better, Paul testifies when he
     says, "The form of the world passeth away"<note type="footnote" n="201" resp="#ebrooks">I Cor.
      vii, 31. </note>, and not 'this world', and Peter also testifies when he writes, "The heavens
     shall be dissolved with fervent heat, and the elements shall burn and collapse"<note
      type="footnote" n="202" resp="#ebrooks">2 Pet. iii. 12. </note>. (But those in whom
     righteousness dwells look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises.) And
     before him David sings about the heavens the passage also, "They all shall grow old as a
     garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed"<note
      type="footnote" n="203" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. ci, 27.</note>. Words agreeing with these were
     written by the Theologian Gregory also, in the sermon on the funeral of his brother Caesarius,
     as follows: "But why am I faint-hearted about the hopes? Why do I become a man of time? I await
     the voice of the archangel, the last trump, the transformation of heaven, the changing of the
     earth, the emancipation of the elements, the renovation of the whole world. Then shall I see
     Caesarius, no longer departing, no longer carried, no longer <pb n="81"/> being mourned for, no
     longer being pitied, bright, glorious, exalted, even as you have often appeared to me in a
     dream, O most brother-loving<note type="footnote" n="204" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign

      VII, 21. The last clause runs <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶτε τοῦ βούλεσθαι τοῦτο ἀνατυποῦντος
       εἶτε τῆς ἀληθείας</foreign>.</note>. And the most wise John, the expounder of the divine
     words, in the commentary on the epistle to the Hebrews speaks as follows: "And besides this he
     demonstrated another thing also worth attention<note type="footnote" n="206" resp="#ebrooks"
      >Jo. Chrys. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πάρεργον</foreign>.</note> in parabolic form: for he also
     denoted the transformation of the world by saying, 'As a garment shall they grow old; and as a
     vesture thou shalt fold them up, and they shall be changed'; a thing which he also states in
     the epistle to the Romans, that he shall transform the world: and setting forth the easiness he
     added that, as a man may fold up a vesture, so shall he fold them up . and change them. But, if
     he effected the transformation and the creation into something better and higher so easily, for
     the creation of something worse he needed another; how long will, you not be ashamed?"<note
      type="footnote" n="207" resp="#ebrooks">In Ep. ad Hebr. Hom, iii, 5, 6 (ed. Field).</note>.
     And in the commentary on the epistle to the Romans he gives an account of this matter in very
     complete form, writing as follows : "'For the expectation of creation', he says, 'looks for the
     revelation of the sons of God. <pb n="82"/> For creation was made subject to vanity, not of its
     own accord, but because of him who subjected it in hope'. For what he says is something like
     this. 'This same creation suffers great pain expecting and hoping for the good things which we
     have just mentioned. But expectation is earnest looking'. But, in order that the account may be
     clearer, he also personifies the whole of this world, as the prophets too do, when they
     introduce rivers clapping hands, and high places leaping, and the mountains dancing; not that
     we may understand these to be animate, nor that we may assign any reason to them; but that we
     may learn the abundance of the good things, so that it reaches even to things without
     perception. And they often do this same thing in the case of distressing things also,
     introducing a vine lamenting and wine and mountains, and the roofs of the temple crying, that
     from this again we may understand the greatness of the evil things. But, imitating these, the
     apostle personifies<note type="footnote" n="208" resp="#ebrooks">A similar passage is cited
      from Sev. in Cramer, Cat. in Ep. ad Rom., p. 137.</note> creation and says that it groans and
     suffers pain; not because he had heard any groan come from earth and sky; but that he may show
     the abundance of the future good things, and the desire of escape from the prevailing evil
     things. 'For creation was <pb n="83"/> made subject to vanity, not of its own accord, but
     because of him who subjected it'. What is 'Creation was made subject to vanity'? It was made
     corruptible. Why and wherefore? On account of you the man. For, since you received a body that
     is mortal and passible, the earth also received a curse, and produced briars and thorns. But,
     that heaven together with the earth will grow old and eventually pass to the better ending,
     hear the prophet saying, 'In the beginning, Lord, thou laidst the foundations of the earth, and
     the heavens are the work of thine hands. They shall perish, but thou endurest; and they all
     shall grow old as a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
     changed'. And Isaiah, demonstrating these things, said, 'Observe heaven above and the earth
     beneath; because heaven hath been solidified as smoke, and the earth shall grow old as a
     garment; and they that dwell therein shall perish like them'. You have seen how 'creation was
     made subject to vanity', how also it shall be freed from corruption; for the former said 'As a
     vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed', and Isaiah said 'They that dwell
     therein shall perish like them', not<note type="footnote" n="209" resp="#ebrooks">This passage

     dwell in it undergo such as this, but the temporary destruction, and through that very thing
     they shall pass to <pb n="84"/> incorruption, just indeed as by saying 'like these things' he
     pointed to creation itself, that is the universe<note type="footnote" n="210" resp="#ebrooks"

     just indeed as Paul also says farther on. However for the present he is speaking about its
     subjection and showing why it was made of this kind, and assigning us as the reason. What then?
     Was violence done to it in that it underwent these things for another? Not at all; for it was
     indeed made for me. How then is a thing which was made for me injured when it undergoes these
     things for my reformation? But, to look at it in another way, we ought not even to raise the
     question of justice and injustice with respect to things without life and perception. But Paul
     because he personified it uses none of the arguments that I have stated, but by another method
     of reasoning sets himself superfluously to comfort the hearer. But what was it? 'What say you?
     It underwent evil things for you and has become corruptible. But it lost nothing; for it shall
     also become incorruptible again through you': for this is the meaning of 'in hope'. But, when
     he says, 'It was not made subject of its own will', he does not say this to show that it is
     possessed of thought, but that you may learn that <pb n="85"/> everything was brought about by
     the will of Christ, and the one is not a reformation of the other. But he stated also in what
     hope. 'Because creation itself also shall be freed'. What is 'itself also'? That not you, but
     it also, even a thing that is far inferior to you, and that does not partake of reason and
     perception, this also shall partake with you in the good things. For it 'shall be delivered',
     he says, 'from the bondage of corruption'; that is, it shall be no longer corruptible; but it
     shall follow the beauty of your body. For, as, when it became corruptible, creation also became
     the same, so, when it is rendered incorruptible, creation also as well shall again follow; to
     denote which indeed he added, 'into the freedom of the glory of the children of God '"<note

    <p>But, inasmuch as the Alexandrine is a stranger and a barbarian to the divine Scripture, and
     is not accustomed to the teachings of this Scripture, he thinks that God is a creator of
     corruption, and he calls the world his sin; a thing that is of fluid nature, but is honoured by
     the grace of incorruptibility together with man for whose sake also it was made. It was not as
     a sin of God that Christ reformed the world's subjection also that was for man's sake, that he
     might bring in one set of <pb n="86"/> things in place of another, as this wicked and deceiving
     man says; in place of bodies that had been delivered to death the immortality of spirits, and
     in place of the corruption of the world eternal incorruptibility, and in place of abundance of
     sins abundance of right acts; but in order that he might raise man, who had fallen, and by
     erring been stripped of the grace of God through which he had immortality, to the original
     state, through the resurrection of the bodies into incorruption, by which this world also shall
     partake of the freedom and the glory, as we have written.</p>

   <p>But, if we in some place hear Scripture say 'the Lord's eyes', we understand God's activity,
    which is signified through the term 'eyes'. And, when again we hear of ears, we understand the
    propensity and inclination that he has toward us, and that he has the attribute of mercifulness,
    and that <pb n="88"/> he brings our service to completion; for Scripture speaks to our weakness
    in human and condescending fashion. And, because it is said that God has wings also, yet we do
    not understand that he has wings, but that his sheltering power is signified through these; for,
    since we are Christians, we must understand the divine Scriptures spiritually, not according to
    the letter.</p>

   <p>But we hear of the said Mara that he said this also as well, that the holy Virgin did not feel
    the birth, in manifest opposition to the Holy Spirit and to the Scriptures which were spoken by
    him. The loud-voiced among prophets, Isaiah, shows that he came forth from the bond of virginity
    like anything else, and he was ineffably born without rending her from Mary the God-bearer,
    saying thus, "Before she that travailed bare, and before the <pb n="89"/> pain of the travail
    came, she escaped and bare a male child"<note type="footnote" n="214" resp="#ebrooks">Is. LXVI,
     7.</note>. The fact that she escaped shows that the birth took place with perception on the
    part of her who gave birth, and not in phantasy<note type="footnote" n="215" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>.</note>. So Gregory the Theologian also in the
    sermon about Easter says of the birth of the babe when it is born: "But she also cried<note
     type="footnote" n="216" resp="#ebrooks">Greg, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκραγέν</foreign>, from
      <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκρήγνυμι</foreign>, which the translator has taken for an aor. ind.
     from <foreign xml:lang="grc">κράζω</foreign>.</note> from the compulsion of the virgin and
    maternal bonds, with great power, when a male child was born from the prophetess, as Isaiah
     announces"<note type="footnote" n="217" resp="#ebrooks">Or. xlv, 13.</note>. How could the fact
    that she cried from the compulsion and did not rend the bond of virginity happen without
    perception, and not with such great perception as this oh the part of her who bare? And these
    things took place ineffably and beyond everything. He who wished to come truly in all our
    attributes, and to be made like to us his brethren without sin, was . certainly born in fleshly
    fashion by a manifest and true birth, causing perception in her who bare, free from all pain and
    suffering; for the prophet proclaims that she gave birth before the pain of the travail came.
    For how was she to be subjected to the trial of pains and anguish, who put an end to the bearing
    of children in anguish through the fact that joy was born for the whole race of men? For, "Lo!",
    he says, "I announce unto you great <pb n="90"/> joy, that is to all the people, that there hath

   <p>For the bread that is consecrated on the holy tables and mystically transmuted is itself truly
    the body, the body of him in whose name it was in <pb n="91"/> fact transmuted, that is of him
    who voluntarily died and rose for our sakes. But, if it is the body of him who rose, it is plain
    that it is impassible and immortal. If we do not look at the bread that is mystically
    transmuted, but at that which comes under the eyes of the senses, and, seeing it broken, do not
    confess it to be indeed immortal, it is time for us to say that neither is it God's body: for
    what is seen is indeed bread. By the faith therefore by which we understand and believe it to be
    the body of God who became incarnate without variation for our sakes, and voluntarily suffered
    and rose, by the same faith we understand and confess that it is also immortal and impassible,
    and bestows impassibility and immortality on us. For he who allowed it to be cut and divided,
    because indeed it was otherwise impossible for us to partake of it, in the same mercifulness
    also allows God's body which has been already transmuted to appear as bread. And for a
    confirmation of the transmutation that is accomplished this has been seen by many even with the
    eyes of their senses themselves, and they have seen bloodstained flesh being broken, not the
    bread that is laid upon the altar.</p>

   <p>The saintly presbyter John has removed and gone to the place of light of the righteous, and to
    the rest above in which those who have so lived abide, expecting the day of the perfect and full
    promise, and not without us to be made perfect, as Paul who was initiated into the deep and
    ineffable things of the foreknowledge of God somewhere says<note type="footnote" n="248"
     resp="#ebrooks">Hebr., xi, 40.</note>. What need is there even to say <pb n="98"/> what
    poignant and heavy sorrow has shaken my soul? For it is a great loss that this wretched
    turbidity of times in which we ourselves have been left alive should by such men being snatched
    away be gradually laid bare and reduced so to speak to the last dregs. About him there is much
    that I might write on the laudatory side, but, overcome by the multitude of subjects, I say this
    briefly, that he alone taught us and caused us to see before our eyes, what is the kingdom of
    heaven that is spoiled, which spoilers seize<note type="footnote" n="249" resp="#ebrooks">
     Matth., xi, 12. </note>. In such a a way, clad in the feeble body as in a chain of lead, he
    parted and dispersed all things outside, and by taking little thought for things that draw
    downwards, and receiving strength through desire of heavenly things, he fitted himself wholly
    for things above, to which he has now easily departed. Therefore we must both weep and groan for
    our solitude, which has been deprived entirely of such a pattern and honourable example. But,
    since we ought to bow our neck before the just scales of the judgments of God, we praise him who
    so orders these things and brings them to pass: for the wise and strenuous Job somewhere says,
    "But if he too hath so judged, who is he that gainsaith him? For what he himself wished he also
     did"<note type="footnote" n="250" resp="#ebrooks">Job, xxiii, 13.</note>. And for <pb n="99"/>
    the rest we pray that by the saintly prayers of those who have made a good departure hence we
    may be saved, and as far as possible be kept unharmed, and not wander from the faith of these
    men, and may be raised to them in memory.</p>
   <p>May these things be so. But in respect of what has been written by your love of God about the
    sustenance of the poor, and our necessity or refreshment, and that you wish to share with us in
    everything, and give readily, know this, that we accept the full purpose of your mind, but,
    being small and weak, we look to Paul the doctor of the church, and as regards our needs set
    ourselves to feel shame and refrain, and look at him who says, "In all things I have kept myself
    without being burdensome to you and will keep myself"<note type="footnote" n="251"
     resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. xi, 9.</note>. But with respect to the relief of our brethren who are
    labouring under the same distresses, by which life is oppressed, I will exert myself, and will
    be importunate, or rather<note type="footnote" n="252"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

    say, "He that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap
    bountifully": and this he seals by the <pb n="100"/> very wise and understanding addition,
    "Every man as his heart willeth, not grudgingly nor of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful
     giver"<note type="footnote" n="255" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. ix, 6, 7.</note>.</p>
   <p>As to the book that I have composed against the heretical fatuity of the wicked grammarian, by
    often writing and asking for it to be sent to you before it was completely finished you were
    acting like men who urge a boy who is healthy and well-prepared, and instructed in military
    affairs, to appear in the line of battle when he has not yet put on his armour. But, now that by
    God's help it has been finished, as far as our little power goes, and has been duly written, and
    duly collated as far as was possible, it has been sent. It was a very difficult task and needed
    a great store of books, and it was so to speak difficult for me to correct, because I am moving
    from place to place, and I have not everywhere at hand fitting testimonies and demonstrations
    from the Scriptures. For I thought it right to meet not only the lamentable babblings of the
    grammarian, but also the whole web of impiety contained in what was defined and done by way of
    innovation at Chalcedon by the synod which met there, and the impious Tome of Leo, taking
    occasion from the very <pb n="101"/> things stated by him (I mean that grammarian) to expose the
    dishonesty of the adversaries, and cut the very root so to speak of bitterness<note
     type="footnote" n="256" resp="#ebrooks">Hebr., xii, 15.</note>, and to show whence it sprang,
    and that these things are not new, but were evolved long ago by the impious company of those who
    unlearnedly held this evil opinion; and not only so, but also to show the agreement of the
    doctors of the orthodox<note type="footnote" n="257" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note>, and of things which to men who are not practised in divine
    doctrines seem to be contrary, and have the same purpose before them, and to guard myself as far
    as possible against contention from all sides. Immediately therefore after the holy Cyril and
    Gregory the Theologian, and all who so to speak taught the same things, had also said that we
    must note the distinction in theory<note type="footnote" n="258" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign>.</note> and in thought of the natures of which Emmanuel is
    composed, from which natures the different character and diverse essence<note type="footnote"
     n="259" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of the elements that
    were joined in union is recognised, Theodotus of saintly memory, bishop of Ancyra in Galatia,
    seems to deny this and not to accept the division in thought<note type="footnote" n="260"
     resp="#ebrooks">Exp. Syn. Nic., 10 (P. G., LXXVII, 1328).</note>. On this account many of the
     orthodox<note type="footnote" n="257" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note> also were confounded by the heretics as if they were adducing
    fathers who said <pb n="102"/> contradictory things, though the objectors could not discern even
    the reading of the words of Theodotus, but read them differently, not as the words stand. This
    therefore and all such points we have brought together from all quarters, and, God stretching
    forth his hand, have explained them, and so have shown the objections of the impious to be vain.
    The demonstrations which they adduce are of ancient date and not of yesterday and the day
    before, and they have been worked up by means of inventions and false attributions and tens of
    thousands of contrivances, since they wish on all sides to show the refutation of the impiety to
    be futile. Therefore it was indeed a task replete with great difficulties to find these
    passages, and lay bare the evil dealing and expose the deceit contained in them. These things
    the prophet's words fit, which were spoken in the name of God to those of Israel, "Ephraim hath
    surrounded me with falsehood, and the house of Israel and of Judah with impiety"<note
     type="footnote" n="261" resp="#ebrooks">Hos. xi, 12.</note>: and still better that also which
    is written in Daniel, "They worked zealously to strengthen their deceit which consisted in
     transgressions"<note type="footnote" n="262" resp="#ebrooks">Not in our texts of Dan.</note>.
    Having therefore as far as possible read all the books, thoroughly and not negligently, I made
    myself acquainted with their evil purpose after <pb n="103"/> much labour and after searching
    for each one of them (often it could not be found at all), and this though I am in a
     condition<note type="footnote" n="263" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

     >καράβια</foreign>.</note> upon the sea. To me also it was gratifying that the wise and
    Christ-loving Zacharias the scholastic<note type="footnote" n="265" resp="#ebrooks">The
     biographer of Severus (P. O., II, 7).</note> should read the dissertation mentioned: for in the
    royal city also I used to bring my works to him, when he would listen attentively with all care
    fulness, and received from God the privilege of being a wise hearer of Jerusalem, I mean of the
    church of God, and did not shrink from being an admirable adviser, on account of the great
    experience and instruction in the sacred books which he has enjoyed from his boyhood. And we
    believe that upon you the religious presbyter Victor<note type="footnote" n="266"
     resp="#ebrooks">See above, ep. 30.</note> the same grace blooms, and that it in no way falls
    short of that which was given to him, or certainly it was even greater, and reaches a still
    higher standard on account of the order of the presbyterate, and the priestly seat to which you
    have been called by God. I therefore beg you all to read the composition diligently and with
    attentive thoughts and, as your habit is, wisely, and if as weak men we have anywhere gone wrong
    to point it out. "That a brother should be helped by a brother, this also is the firm strength
    of a fortified <pb n="104"/> city"<note type="footnote" n="267" resp="#ebrooks">Pr., xviii,
     19.</note>, the God-inspired words teach. Therefore also we made it our business, as far as
    possible, to bring this dissertation also to certain men of intelligence and skilled in
    argument, who are not without a share in divine and profane learning, and read it to them,
    generally stealing an opportunity for reading, and doing this in secret, on account of the
    present time. The beginning of this treatise I have put in such a form<note type="footnote"
     n="268"><foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα</foreign>.</note>, in order that I may seem to have
    prepared this while I was living in Antioch, lest perhaps these adversaries might kindle a
    greater flame of prejudice against me, if they perceived that this had been composed by me in
    exile: and in truth when I was there I began to prepare material for an answer, though, when the
    persecution came, it scattered these things.</p>
   <p>Since you, the God-loving presbyter Philip<note type="footnote" n="269" resp="#ebrooks">Select
     Letters of Severus, i, 51; p. 181, 384; see below, ep. 52.</note>, have often asked for the
    Book of Dispensations as you say to be sent you, the only reason for which we have put off doing
    this is that we are desirous of first carrying out your request, and casting an eye of criticism
    on what is written in it; which down to this day we have been confident of being able to do,
    though all our attention was occupied with the said composition. Therefore, when we have read
    your book also hastily, we will send it as soon as possible. <pb n="105"/></p>

    himself, since he was a bishop legally appointed, but was afterwards perverted to the abominable
    tenet of a self-created observance<note type="footnote" n="271" resp="#ebrooks">This represents

    dream of the name of service or priesthood; but eventually after some time, if some of them

   <p>To the holy fathers and archimandrites of the holy cloisters in the East and the presbyters
    and deacons, and all the brothers who are practising the God-loved life of monasticism Severus
    greeting in our Lord.</p>
   <p>I have heard that the great convents of the holy monasteries in the East, who are honoured for
    eminence in life and in asceticism and for age, have withdrawn, and that to this same thing they
    have been driven by compulsion, by those who without fear stretch out their hands against every
    man: and I groaned deeply; and I continued weeping till there was no strength left in me to weep
    more, as the Holy Scripture somewhere says<note type="footnote" n="281" resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam.
     xxx, 4.</note>. For I sorrowed not for you (no tears are needed for you) but for the countries
    which have been deprived of you, and for those who live a religious life in them, and to speak
    generally for all that district<note type="footnote" n="282" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">χώρα</foreign>.</note>. If there were not universal wrath, and the face of God
    were not averted, you at least would <pb n="108"/> have remained, as pillars of the great house
    who would have prevented the ruin that was threatening it. So also, when Jerusalem was being
    chastised for her sins, and was being delivered to various chastisements, the God of mercy, 'he
    that taketh pleasure in mercy'<note type="footnote" n="283" resp="#ebrooks">Mich., vii,
     18.</note> (for so the divine Scriptures term him), again spared her on account of his great
    mercifulness, and, because he did not wish to bring a complete destruction, is seen to address,
    those who administered such chastisements as were to come, things which Jeremiah saw and heard
    by prophetic perception, in this way: "Go up to her walls and pull down; but make not a full
    end. Leave her foundations because they are of the Lord"<note type="footnote" n="284"
     resp="#ebrooks">Jer. v, 10.</note>. If then you, who are the foundations of the Lord which
    stave off destruction, have now been disturbed and shaken, what is there to expect, save sore
    stripes from God, and great evils that cannot be assuaged and wrath that is poured out, which he
    who in just judgment brings it declares in such words as these: "Behold! my wrath and mine anger
    is poured out upon this country and upon men and upon cattle and upon all things that are in the
    field, and upon all the fruits of the earth, and they shall be burnt up and shall not be
     extinguished"<note type="footnote" n="285" resp="#ebrooks">Id., vii, 20.</note>? </p>
   <pb n="109"/>
   <p>For these reasons I sorrowed, and I perceived not the number of my groans, while I
    contemplated the desolation of the ways that led to your convents and sent to you those who had
    a zealous desire to delight their souls by the remembrance of divine things, and to whom
    constant standing and angelic singing were a festival, and the upward-pressing life, which
    reminds rational souls of the imitation of God. For thus Jeremiah also made lament after the
    destruction of Jerusalem, and said as in a figure: "The ways of Zion mourn because there is none
    to come to the feast. All the gates in her are desolate"<note type="footnote" n="286"
     resp="#ebrooks">Lam. i. 4.</note>. (And he himself clearly said that her produce is given to
    destruction). "Whose priests shall go into captivity groaning, and they that have taken upon
    them the virgin life shall be led away. And she that was abandoned by them hath bitterness for
    these things". For, in order that none might think that the lamentation that was made was not
    right, on account of beams and stones and great buildings that were razed to the earth and the
    dust, exalting plainly by words the greatness of the disaster, he made proclamation and said:
    "Her priests groan and her virgins <pb n="110"/> are carried away, and she herself within
    herself hath bitterness"<note type="footnote" n="287" resp="#ebrooks">Lam. i, 4.</note>. And
    Elisha the great, who received a double portion of the spirit that was in Elijah, the man of
    many visions and miracles, foreseeing that which was future like the present, and how many evils
    the people of Israel was to endure, inasmuch as Hazael, King of Syria, was to come against them
    to war, wept bitterly when he .considered the incurability of the evils that were coming, and
    under stress of these things he could not refrain, and abstain from tears, and from pity, though
    they were about to endure these chastisements as they deserved. And therefore also the divine
    Scripture says as in wonder: "And the man of God wept"<note type="footnote" n="288"
     resp="#ebrooks">2 Kings viii, 11.</note>. But I beg and entreat your sanctities (for you are my
    affection no less than he<note type="footnote" n="289" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr.</note>), you who
    also suffer with your kindred, and, to speak in the words of the apostle, "have a heart of mercy
    and of grace"<note type="footnote" n="290" resp="#ebrooks">Col. iii, 12.</note>, pray for the
    sheep and avert the wrath, and cease not holding up your saintly hands to your Jesus, saying to
    him from the divine Scriptures, "These sheep what have they done? Have pity, Lord, upon thy
    people, and give not thine inheritance to shame"<note type="footnote" n="291" resp="#ebrooks">2
     Sam. xxiv, 17; Joel, ii, 17.</note>. Perhaps he will be turned by these prayers and repent, and
    will leave in his country a blessing, <pb n="111"/> a sacrifice and a libation to the Lord our
    God. For on your account I have no weight of care and no anxiety: for well I know that
    everything is easy to you, and there is no impediment or difficulty of walking for your feet,
    which are adorned in apostolic fashion with bareness, and by their steps are able to bless even
    the uninhabited deserts and make them habitable; . and that the lack of money in your girdles is
    a fulness of all abundance, so that it provides a superfluity for others also, and the staff in
    your hands is a symbol of the very fixity and firmness of the faith that is in you, so that it
    supports those who are shaken also and they do not fall; but the earth and the heaven and the
     air<note type="footnote" n="292" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>
    are your purse, and all the elements supply food in diverse forms and coming of itself, and make
    it known to everyone that "man liveth not by bread alone, but also by every word that proceedeth
    out of the mouth of God"<note type="footnote" n="293" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. iv, 4.</note>: I
    forbear to say, what is a great thing and very true, that, since you have a spiritual rock going
    before you (and Paul said that Christ is a rock<note type="footnote" n="294" resp="#ebrooks">1
     Cor. x, 4.</note>), that is to you food and drink; for you were persecuted with this same rock
    when it was persecuted. For in the case of the sons of Israel of old, who saw little, and had
    their eye blinded by Egyptian <pb n="112"/> darkness, and could scarcely see the writing of the
    law and could not contemplate the depth of hidden mysteries, the apostle justly wrote that "that
    rock followed them"<note type="footnote" n="295" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. x, 4.</note>: for it was
    right that they who were so-imperfect should be first exercised in the law, and afterwards see
    Christ following them. Wherefore also in waterless countries he gave them water in tangible
    form, assuaging the thirst of the flesh; and, whenever they desired flesh, he invisibly brought
    birds like rain from the air<note type="footnote" n="296" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>, and other things like these and resembling them. But
    before your own perfections, who can contemplate the very glory of the Lord 'with open face', as
    again Paul said<note type="footnote" n="297" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. iii, 18.</note>, that rock
    continually goes in front, giving suprasensual food and drink, and showing everyone that through
    the things which you have endured you cry and say, "Who shall separate me from the love of
    Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger or nakedness or clanger or the
    sword, as it is written, 'For thy sake we die every day; we have been reckoned as sheep for
    slaughter'; but in all these things we are victorious through him who loved us"<note
     type="footnote" n="298" resp="#ebrooks">Rom. viii, 35-37.</note>. For the results of your
    victory are not only <pb n="113"/> in this evil present world, in which you showed
    invincibility, but all of them are more truly in the future world. Then all who have been
    exercised in the life of virginity, and have prevailed over shameful passions and are honoured
    for white-haired old age of the intellect, and for the holy order, and deceive the accompanying
    honour, shall be gratified with such joy that their soul shall be made drunk with good things,
    as to which Jeremiah the prophet, depicting them beforehand, spoke thus: "Then shall virgins
    rejoice in gatherings of young men and old men shall rejoice: and I will turn their mourning
    into joy, and I will make them rejoice: and I will make great and make drunken the soul of the
    priests the sons of Levi, and my people shall be filled with my good things"<note
     type="footnote" n="299" resp="#ebrooks">Jer. xxxviii, 13, 14.</note>; and these things that
    fail not and are as they are, and are never destroyed. Such as these are the blessed homes and
    mansions. But, if there is yet an extension and we have not been brought to the end of time,
    assuredly 'he who scattered Israel he will gather him, and he will keep him as a shepherd who
    feedeth his flock' and will say, "With weeping went they out, and with consolation will I bring
    them: and I will make them to dwell by streams of waters in a right way and they shall not again
    go astray"<note type="footnote" n="300" resp="#ebrooks">Ibid., 9, 10.</note>. </p>
   <pb n="114"/>
   <p>But pray that we also may hold to the right and unerring way, and our foot may not turn aside
    to the right hand or to the left from the king's highway<note type="footnote" n="301"
     resp="#ebrooks">Num. xx, 17.</note> which was rightly traversed by those seers and ministers of
    the word. For, inasmuch as you exercise yourselves in the law of the Lord by night as well as by
    day, you know well that, even if a man contend, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully.
    For certain men have come in upon us, wishing to put a blemish on the 'good confession' to which
    we were called and which we confessed 'before many witnesses'<note type="footnote" n="302"
     resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim. vi, 12.</note> as the apostle said, that is, before the whole church and
    'the elect angels'<note type="footnote" n="303" resp="#ebrooks"> Id., v, 21.</note>, never
    having yielded to remissness. For that 'we are not of remissness which leads to perdition'<note
     type="footnote" n="304" resp="#ebrooks">Hebr., x, 39.</note> you also well know: for you are
    the first who testify. For, 'having no sound knowledge of what they say or the things about
    which they strive'<note type="footnote" n="305" resp="#ebrooks"> 1 Tim. i, 7.</note>, they do
    not consent to confess that the true flesh of God and the Word which is from the holy God-bearer
    and ever-virgin Mary and from the Holy Spirit, which was hypostatically united to him, so that
    from the fact that he came to be with us as God who became man he was named Emmanuel, and that
    he was made like unto us in all things except sin, suffers <pb n="115"/> like us and is
    susceptible of innocent passions, but say that he suffered in semblance, and that the flesh was
    impassible and immortal at the time of the voluntary and saving Cross; and besides other
    impossible things the wretched men foolishly speak of false passions, and in false words they
    name phantasy<note type="footnote" n="306" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φαντασία</foreign>.</note> incorruptibility, and deny the true incorruptibility, and they
    fail to notice the wisdom of the dispensation whereby the impassible God united to himself those
    of our passions which do not fall under the description of sin, wishing in it to taste our death
    voluntarily, destroy its dominion over us, and by means of the Resurrection to set us free in
    incorruptibility, that is in impassibility and immortality, and raise us to our first state in
    which also we were created. If the Word of God desired to display passions and death in unreal
    form, the Incarnation is quite superfluous. He had the divine impassibility and immortality, and
    so also he might have suffered as in semblance and shown himself after the fashion of former
    appearances, as he appeared as a man who wrestled with Jacob and was received in Abraham's
    house, and was represented in many forms through the prophets: for this he himself is seen to
    have said in Hosea the prophet<note type="footnote" n="307" resp="#ebrooks">Hos. XII,
    10.</note>. But this was not <pb n="116"/> what he desired, but that by means of a real death he
    might save the man who had died through the deceit of the serpent, and make his own Resurrection
    the gate and way of return to everlasting life. For this reason Paul cries louder than all
    trumpets in the ears of men who will not hear: "For, since by man came death, by man also cometh
    the resurrection of the dead. For, as in Adam all died, so also in Christ shall all live"<note
     type="footnote" n="308" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. XV, 21, 22.</note>. But<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">...</supplied></damage> with<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">...</supplied></damage> the Scriptures and<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">...</supplied></damage> these
    hasty and presumptuous men presumed blasphemously to say against the divine Scriptures and
    against the holy fathers who interpreted them in approved fashion, who at various times fed the
    holy churches. From these things you see clearly how much difference and distinction there is
    between truth and error even as the heaven is far from the earth, and that out of the thought of
    their heart they have 'devised words of iniquity' and that 'truth has perished in their ways,
    and they could not walk in the right way', and also that 'they have removed their thoughts from
     understanding'<note type="footnote" n="309" resp="#ebrooks">Is. LIX, 13-15.</note>. For well
    did Isaiah the prophet expose them beforehand by these words. <pb n="117"/>
   </p>
   <p>Pray therefore, saintly ones (for indeed I say the same thing many times) that we may be
    delivered from evil and unjust men. For they have been unable not only to endure reproof on
    account of their wickedness, but even to give drink to them that thirst: for, besides their
    thoughts that blaspheme against God, 'their counsels<note type="footnote" n="1" resp="#ebrooks"
    > </note> also 'are counsels of murder'<note type="footnote" n="310" resp="#ebrooks">Is. LIX,
     7.</note>. For this very thing Isaiah says with me concerning them. But that these same men may
    be changed to what is right make the subject of your own prayers. For we on our part look to him
    who willeth not the death of a sinner so much as that he be converted and live<note
     type="footnote" n="311" resp="#ebrooks">Ez. xxxiii, 11.</note>. Indeed at first on the entreaty

    manner and urged him to have regard to the holy fathers and to the approved doctors and follow
    them, and correct himself. And even upon this he attacked my meanness in a ferocious manner,
    worse than any raging savage beast, and kept bitterly complaining because he did not find me a
    partner of his error, and over the whole world, as far as he could, he sent out and scattered
    abroad what he had <pb n="118"/> written, which came from his heart 'not from the mouth of the
     Lord'<note type="footnote" n="313" resp="#ebrooks">Jer. XXIII, 16.</note>: and we were set
    forth as a laughing-stock to those who contend for the Chalcedonian impiety; and in Palestine,

   <p>When I took in my hands the letter that has now been addressed to me by your holinesses, I
    began to read it with such pleasure as if a son were seeing his father's face after the lapse of
    a long time. But after reading it I knew you better from the contents; for I found the letter to
    be in reality wholly occupied with fatherly reproofs; for it is often a habit of fathers also to
    apply unfounded <pb n="124"/> reproofs to sons in order to make them more<note type="footnote"
     n="333"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> industrious and vigilant; but, when
    they see them making a wise defence to the accusation and dissipating the reproofs, then they
    exchange the desire of fault-finding for the desire of natural affection, and are filled with
    tears and exult from joy, and submit to a defeat that they have made an object of much prayer,
    and proclaim the sons' victory as their own. Accordingly listen like fathers to your son's
    defence, and judge upright judgment, and test the matter carefully as in the scales of a
    balance. You say in the letter that we departed from the strict rule in making union with the
    Isaurians, because Philoxenus, when he wrote to them in the course of the controversy, testified
    that there is nothing wanting in the edict<note type="footnote" n="334" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">ἤδικτον</foreign>, i. c. the Henotikon, and so wherever 'edict' occurs in the
     translation.</note>, and said that he was in communion with the prelate of Alexandria<note
     type="footnote" n="335" resp="#ebrooks">Cf. Select Letters of Severus, p. 20. </note>, and did
    not omit the names of the heretics. Tell me what blame this casts upon the Isaurians, since they
    are shown to have summoned Philoxenus by letter to the high standard of their profession, and,
    when he would not at that time rise to their height and range himself on the side of strictness,
    together with the others to have left those who were in communion with <pb n="125"/> Flavian who
    previously held the see of Antioch, and united with us only, and exposed in writing the
    imperfection of the edict, and professed that they would not otherwise enter into communion with
    the chief of the Alexandrines until he first made a defence to the orthodox<note type="footnote"
     n="336" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note> in common and
    removed from the midst the scandals which separate us from him. How then do you find fault with
    them as if they had neglected these things, things which they were in fact careful to put in
    writing? If to write to Philoxenus and summon him to the perfect standard is a cause of blame in
    them, it is time for us to blame some of you also who in the royal city urged us to go [to]
    Philoxenus and examine him, and to bring serious accusations against the [holy] Cyril because he
    wrote to Acacius the prelate of Berrhoea, when he advised him to disavow the 12 chapters<note
     type="footnote" n="337" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαια</foreign>.</note> and
    the other works against Nestorius. But it is not receiving a letter from men who are involved in
    heresies, or otherwise not of a perfect mind, which subjects us to blame, but adhering to the
    things written by [them], and not walking in a contrary direction. I am much <pb n="126"/>
    astonished at that part of your [letter in which after] saying that the edict is imperfect you
    write lower down, "We, [when] in the chapters<note type="footnote" n="338" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαια</foreign>.</note> which we presented to the prelate of the
    men of Jerusalem we said that the edict contains a [right] profession of faith, said so as a
    concession, not as the truth". How then is it imperfect, if in truth it does not contain a right
    profession, and does not remove the scandals from the midst? That which is imperfect contains at
    any rate some part [agreeing with] that which is perfect, so that [that] which is wanting for
    perfection may be restored: but that [which] contains nothing sound [even] in part is not
    imperfect but entirely [false]<note type="footnote" n="339" resp="#ebrooks"> This is the sense
     required.</note> and is the same as that which does not exist. [But] how is it that you, when
    writing to father Stephen the Isaurian of religious memory, imitated what was [formerly] said as
    a concession, and said, "The edict contains a right profession of faith"? Or how is it that the
    God-loving fathers in Egypt reject the written testament<note type="footnote" n="340"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαθηκη</foreign>.</note> of defence which remained
    with them as they say from father John the archimandrite and bishop who is among the saints,
    [which] is composed of the actual bare words of the edict? Or rather<note type="footnote"
     n="341"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note>, to <pb n="127"/> cite the very words
    themselves, let someone proceed to say what heresy it introduces when it is said, "For we say
    that both the miracles and the passions, which he underwent voluntarily in the flesh, belong to
    one only Son of God", and again, "Because the true and sinless Incarnation from the God-bearer
    did not bring about an addition of a Lord; for the Trinity remained a Trinity even when one of
    the Trinity, God the Word, became incarnate"<note type="footnote" n="342" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Evagr., iii, 14.</note>. But perhaps you will say that the words are rightly expressed and
    free from blame, but are not sufficient to demolish the scandals; for, inasmuch as they are
    ambiguously expressed, even those also who call the one Christ two natures profess them, since
    [they confess] the form<note type="footnote" n="343" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >σχῆμα</foreign>.</note> which they call the Son who became incarnate to be one and the same
    in identity of honour, in identity of name in that he is of the same [essence], in authority, as
    we ourselves elsewhere stated, when convicting the edict of ambiguity; but we ought not to open
    a door to impiety by ambiguity in what we write, according to the words of Gregory the
    Theologian, "For this is a common sandal which is put on both feet; this is an image which looks
    at everyone who passes; a sifting which [sifts out] everything"<note type="footnote" n="344"
     resp="#ebrooks">I cannot find the source of this citation. </note>. But this argument is then
     [sound]<note type="footnote" n="345" resp="#ebrooks">This is the sense required.</note>
    <pb n="128"/> when the ambiguity is introduced [and the] truth condemned, [for accuracy] is then
    expelled and banished, [like that which] was done by the synod which the holy [Athanasius]
    termed 'an assembly of Caiaphas'<note type="footnote" n="346" resp="#ebrooks">The synod must be
     either that of Nice (p. 134) or that of Constantinople in 360 (p. 130), and the author can
     hardly be other than Athanasius; but I cannot find the passage, unless it be De Syn.,
     20.</note>, [when it introduced] the expression 'like' and removed [that of] co-essentiality,
    in order that the Arians might understand the word 'like' to mean 'resembling'<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">...</supplied></damage> and the orthodox<note type="footnote" n="347" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note> 'that which is of the same essence'<note
     type="footnote" n="348" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and
    'that which does not vary in anything'. But, if, when it pronounced that [the Son] is like the
    Father, it had added, 'that is identical [in] essence<note type="footnote" n="348"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> with the Father', it would by
    the addition have limited the expression of likeness which is [common] to both and eradicated
    the error arising from the ambiguity. So also a man who accepts the right confession of the
    edict, if it is enough for him, and he does not add the exact words which remove the heresy,
    opens a door to impiety through the ambiguity of the written words, and falls under the
    sentences of the holy Gregory in that he is doing detriment to the truth. But, if besides the
    edict he both confesses one incarnate nature of God the Word and anathematizes those who speak
    of two natures after the union, and the operations and properties of these, and all the impiety
    that was <pb n="129"/> confirmed at Chalcedon, he has removed the danger<note type="footnote"
     n="349" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κίνδυνος</foreign>.</note> that is expected
    from the ambiguity, and has bound the understanding of both parties under the yoke of
    exactitude, and has also followed the law of Gregory the Theologian who in the 3rd letter to
    Cledonius wrote thus: "Since therefore the same expressions when rightly understood are
    consistent with religion, but when badly interpreted contain foul impiety, what wonder is it if
    we accepted the words of Vitalis also in a more religious sense, for so our object urges, while
    others are furious against the sense of the things written?"<note type="footnote" n="350"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 103 (P. G., XXXVII, 199).</note> Let us therefore acquiesce in the
    spiritual distinctions of Gregory the Theologian, and shun ambiguity only when it stands alone,
    and by the double meaning inflicts injury on the truth; but, when it is made subservient to
    accuracy by the addition of more perfect statements, let us accept it. This same teaching is
    given by Basil also who has the same spirit as Gregory in the epistle which he wrote to Maximus
    the philosopher, the words being as follows: "But for my part I must call what is yours
     mine<note type="footnote" n="351" resp="#ebrooks">Bas. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐγώ δὲ εἰ χρή
      τοὐμόν ἴδιον εἰπεῖν</foreign>.</note>. As to the term 'like in essence', if it has added
    'without variation', I accept the expression, as <pb n="130"/> coming to the same thing as
    co-essentiality, that is, according to the sound meaning of the expression 'co-essentiality',
    which those at Nicaea also understood, when they called the Only one 'Light of Light', 'true God
    of true God', and similar things, and consequently introduced the expression 'co-essentiality'.
    But it is never possible for us to imagine any difference between light and light, or between
    truth and truth, or between the essence of the Only one and that of the Father. If anyone
    therefore takes it as I have said, I accept the expression. But, if anyone severs 'without
    variation' from 'like', as those at Constantinople<note type="footnote" n="352" resp="#ebrooks"
     >In 360: see p. 128, n. 1.</note> did, I am suspicious of the phrase, as diminishing the glory
    of the Only one. For even in the case of things that resemble in a few points also, and are very
    much inferior to the originals, we are accustomed often to use the expression 'like'"<note
     type="footnote" n="353" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 9, 3 (P. G., XXXII, 269). </note>. In accordance
    therefore with these enactments of the fathers, since a mention of the edict was once inserted
    in the defence of the Isaurians, we have accepted it, because the whole evil-doing that is
    contrived by the ambiguity was removed by the very fact that the things that are lacking were
    added, <pb n="131"/> and a clear defence was made to us that exposed the imperfection of the
    edict. These things I was desirous to write, not out of self-seeking<note type="footnote"
     n="354">Representing <foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοτιμία</foreign>.</note>, but because I have
    inserted in the letter a portion of what has often been addressed by me in laborious arguments
    to many who maintained that the edict sufficed for a defence. It is not as one might think
    because we cling to the memory of the edict that we are compelled to employ words of this kind,
    nor because we wish to oppose you; but, since by reason of our sins 'we have been made a
    spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men', as the wise Paul says<note type="footnote"
     n="355" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. iv, 9.</note>, and we are henceforth set under the eyes of
    everyone, we must speak the words of truth to everyone alike, and guard ourselves beforehand
    against causes of blame even from all quarters, and use the examples and God-inspired teachings
    of the holy fathers to guide us in what is right, and not love laughter and show ourselves
    betrayers of lawful accuracy, nor yet incur blame for lack of learning and spring beyond the
    bounds of the wrestling-space, but wisely consider the saying of Koheleth, "There is a righteous
    man who perisheth in his righteousness"<note type="footnote" n="356" resp="#ebrooks">Eccl., vii,
     13.</note>. Even now we are ready, and that since the holy <pb n="132"/> John the presbyter and
    archimandrite <damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">.....</supplied></damage> wrote to us, to proceed to Egypt, only provided
    that he will choose for us a quiet spot suited for our purpose, so that we may not be annoyed by
    turbulent men, nor yet suffer injury from our opponents. For through your saintly prayers those
     orthodox<note type="footnote" n="357" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"

   <p>In dealing with abstentions with regard to names preserved in the sacred tablets we must in
    fitness duly compare the things of which the sacred Scripture said that, when they fall into
    water that is contained in small vessels, they pollute it, but, when into pools or wells or
    cisterns containing many streams, they cause no stain or pollution. For the law of the divine
    Spirit said thus: "And every drink that ye shall drink in any vessel shall be polluted; and
    everything on which anything from a dead body falls is polluted. However fountains of water and
    pools and cisterns of water shall be pure"<note type="footnote" n="380" resp="#ebrooks">Lev. xi,
     25, 26.</note>. This principle then ought to be observed in the present case also. If a man
    separates from many on the ground that they are infected with heresy, or that they communicate
    with those who are infected, let him with all his power maintain abstention from the dead body,
    and not mention even the name of those who are under suspicion and not genuine, lest it fall and
    pollute the <pb n="139"/> purity of the communion. But, if the holding of the orthodox faith,
    and an anathema of every heresy reigns in the churches, and whole countries and provinces<note
     type="footnote" n="381" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπαρχίας</foreign> (for
      <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαρχίας</foreign>).</note>, and populous churches, confess one
    uncorrupted confession, then names which are thought to pollute are inundated by the multitude
    of streams. It is good that no particle of a dead body should be introduced even into a large
    quantity of water; but if perchance<note type="footnote" n="382"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἆρα</foreign>.</note> it in fact happen to be introduced, it is cleansed by the quantity of
    streams, and swamped by the quantity of cleansing<note type="footnote" n="383" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Cf. Select Letters of Severus, p. 289.</note>. We find that in fact the holy fathers also who
    were in former times upholders of the right word managed these things in this way. Show us from
    the compositions of the doctors of the church that, after so large a number had found fault with
    the faith of the 318 at Ariminus [sic], any question was raised about the names of those who had
    died. And, not to make the letter tedious by using many words, let us pass on in mind to times
    that are near and not far removed. We find that the holy Timothy, he who underwent long
     exiles<note type="footnote" n="384" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >ἐξορίας</foreign>.</note>, united with everyone in the Encyclical, and communicated with Paul
    bishop of the city of the Ephesians, and Peter who had become prelate of <pb n="140"/> this
    great Christ-loving city of Antioch, while names under suspicion were preserved in the sacred
    tablets; and the holy Cyril, when he united with the Easterns after the deprivation<note
     type="footnote" n="385" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">καθαίρεσις</foreign>.</note> of
    Nestorius, when many bishops had died, and had departed under the stain of the Nestorian heresy,
    made no inquiry about names. If therefore those who set great store by strictness in respect of
    such names say that the oblation is not pure, let them know that their strictness also draws its
    origin and existence from such communion, and descends from that source as from a root. For the
    saintly Timothy, as we have said, consented to hold communion with those of like opinions in
    company with such names, he whose grandsons they are who now with a boastful front loudly
    proclaim, "You shall not approach me because I am pure". And this we say superfluously, that
    some of the bishops in the cities of the Easterns set even this also straight, and ceased to
    mention all such names: for others found it impossible to set this same thing straight; and it
    was not right for such a reason for them to enter on wrangles<note type="footnote" n="386"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ζυγομάχας</foreign>.</note>, and set themselves in
    array against the enthusiasm of the people of the cities, in order that they might suffer
    shipwreck in the most essential things. </p>

     n="388"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note>, and have not been removed from the

     type="footnote" n="389" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀρθοδοξία</foreign>.</note> of
    the holy fathers also. Though Eusebius Pamphili contended for the disease of Arius, both in
    speech and in act, the members of the church of Caesarea mentioned his name, until the holy
    Cyril passed by, when he was hastening to the city of the Ephesians, and had this name removed.
    What shall we then say? That throughout the time during which the name of Eusebius stood in the
    sacred tablets it perturbed the oblation of men who held right opinions<note type="footnote"
     n="388"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note>? What? When again the same holy Cyril
    of saintly memory wrote to the holy <pb n="142"/> Proclus bishop of Constantinople at that time
    to spare the name of Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was the putrid source of the hateful and putrid
     tenets<note type="footnote" n="390"><foreign xml:lang="grc">δόγματα</foreign>.</note> of
    Nestorius, in order not to give an opportunity to those who wished to disturb the church<note
     type="footnote" n="391" resp="#ebrooks">Ep. 72 (P. G., LXXVII, 345).</note>, shall we think
    that thereby some pollution and stain of heresy was inflicted on the oblation of the
     orthodox<note type="footnote" n="392" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ὀρθόδοξοι</foreign>.</note>? By no means. If we search into this, there is no time at which
    we shall see the church to be pure. If is already well-known that such things have not and never
    will cause any injury to the whole fulness of the body of Christ. In fact in Leviticus we find
    something like this written, where it is dealing with the pollution that is caused to anything
    by a dead body, as follows: "And all food that ye shall eat on which water shall come, and there
    fall upon it any of these dead things, it is pollution; and every drink that ye shall drink in
    any vessel is polluted. However of<note type="footnote" n="393" resp="#ebrooks">Thus
     meaninglessly has the translator rendered the genitive after <foreign xml:lang="grc"

     pure"<note type="footnote" n="394" resp="#ebrooks">Lev. xi, 24-26.</note>. What then is it that
    is made known to us by this? That, when certain men are by themselves, in a church for instance
    or in one <pb n="143"/> city, or in monasteries perhaps make mention of the names of those who
    are under suspicion and of dead men, like the similarly small amount of water contained in a
    vessel they are polluted by the mention, as if something dead were falling; but, when churches
    of many provinces<note type="footnote" n="395" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ὑπαρχίας</foreign> (for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπαρχίας</foreign>).</note> and of dioceses
    are held in one bond of faith, and resemble fair fountains and pools and cisterns of water, the
    dead thing which has the property of polluting if it fall cannot injure; for it is swamped by
    the flow, and by the abundance of many streams. I have said these things in order to show from
    the God-inspired Scripture, and from the bishops, the pastors, the upholders of right reason,
    that in such matters observance of every point is endless, and that mention of this kind<note

    <p>Being pricked by these words and divine laws as by goads, and fearing and trembling, I
     mentioned the matter of those from Cappadocia who wish to be united to us to the saintly
     Dioscorus bishop of Alexandria and our fellow-minister, and<note type="footnote" n="1"
      resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> consulted with your learning
     also, revealing to you all my affairs from the beginning, and hiding nothing whatever; and I do
     not know how it is that you have thrown over the letters and consultations that have passed
     since that time, and tell us to take no account of those from Cappadocia the waste country, but
     to treat the divine laws that I have just mentioned with contempt. In the first place the same
     account is due to one soul <pb n="146"/> and to many; and next how can we call the two
     Cappadocias and Armenia waste places? But in this you thought or spoke rather<note
      type="footnote" n="404" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> like
     the natives of the country (allow me with your pardon to say), and not truly. For it is the
     habit of the Alexandrines to think that the sun rises for them only, and towards them only the
     lamp burns, so that they even jestingly term outside cities 'lampless'. If for the purpose of
     right judgments it is possible to weigh the numbers of a people, like weights that are
     distinguished by the inclinations of the scale of a balance, the inhabitants of all these
     countries will produce no less than the whole city of the Alexandrines. But you say that in the
     case of men who make right requests we should have regard to our understanding. But in this
     also we have a better principle, as we showed in what we said a little before, having countless
     other texts of the God-inspired Scriptures also which command us, that those that are strong
     should bear the infirmities of those that are weak<note type="footnote" n="405" resp="#ebrooks"
      >Rom. XV, 1.</note>, and that we should not have regard to our own affairs but to the interest
     of others<note type="footnote" n="406" resp="#ebrooks">Philipp. II, 4.</note>, and texts that
     agree with those. And, while was writing and speaking <pb n="147"/> these things, I showed
     caution in every point, and did not trust to myself in everything, but awaited the assent of
     the saintly Dioscorus my fellow-minister who shares my opinions, and Eleusinius<note

     and conjunction I passed over, for I did not wish to term him our fellow-communicant by letter
     (how could I so term one who is not bound in communion?) Wherefore also Asterius, his
     God-loving brother, and bishop of Nyssa, is ready to leave the see. So for our part we held to
     our own principles and did not give any man, to speak in the words of Scripture, cause of

    anathematizes by name the things done at Chalcedon against the orthodox faith, and against those

    FORMATION OF MAN, AND THAT THE MONASTIC HABIT FREES FROM PREVIOUS SINS.</head>
   <p>And now I turn to the statement made by your religiousness, that one of those who live an
    ascetic life of philosophic labour, after he had come and presented himself for ordination<note
     type="footnote" n="425" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>.</note> in
    order that he might officiate as a priest to God, having afterwards come to remember his life,
    and the sins that he had committed in his boyhood, and all the rest of his life, and having
    learned <pb n="155"/> that the canon requires blamelessness, sought to range himself outside the
    priestly ministry, and in a way renounce ordination<note type="footnote" n="426" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</foreign>.</note>, and satisfy the canon. How is this
    endurable? tell me; and how is it anything but a result of false modesty? You write that this
    man has lived both with earnestness and according to the ordinances of philosophy<note
     type="footnote" n="427" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">φιλοσοφία</foreign>.</note>,
    and, to speak in the language of Scripture, looks to himself<note type="footnote" n="428"
     resp="#ebrooks">2 John 8(?).</note>. If the facts of that great sin which cuts off from the
    priesthood or from the ministry had happened after the profession of monastic life, then there
    would have been reason for modesty to play its part. But, where the facts of the sin happened
    firsthand the enrolling in philosophy followed, how is it right to feel fear where no fear
     is<note type="footnote" n="429">Ps. LII, 6. </note>? We believe, not without the divine Spirit,
    that the holy habit of the monastic life carries forgiveness of sins, and strips off the old man
    'who is corrupted in the lusts of error', and puts on 'the new man who was created in God, in
    righteousness and sanctity of truth'<note type="footnote" n="430" resp="#ebrooks"> Eph., IV, 22,
     24.</note>, as the wise Paul somewhere said in writing. I adduce, although I am addressing
    those who know, in confirmation of what has been stated, <pb n="156"/> the vision which that
    heavenly man the great Antony saw. What in fact does the man who told the story of his life say,
    the divine Athanasius who is among the high-priests? "When he was about to eat, and had risen to
    pray at the 9th hour, he felt his consciousness lifted up, and (wonderful to relate!) he felt
    himself standing and seeing himself, as if he had been taken outside him, and as if he were
    being led into the air by some men, and afterwards some grievous and cruel men standing in the
    air and seeking to prevent him from passing. And, when the conductors opposed, these required an
    account to know if he were not liable to them; but, when they sought to make an account from his
    birth, those who were leading Antony prevented it, saying to these: 'What happened from his
    birth the Lord has wiped out; but you may inquire into the time since he became a monk and made
    profession to God'. Then upon their making charges and failing to convict, the road was made
    free and unimpeded before him. And immediately he saw himself standing, as if he had come to
    himself, and that he was again wholly Antony"<note type="footnote" n="431" resp="#ebrooks">Vit.
     Ant., 65.</note>. Guided therefore by this divine command, I have answered the present
    question; and I affirm and say with confidence that that modest man <pb n="157"/> must retain
    the priestly ministry, since with his very scrupulousness and carefulness he has conferred a
    great benefit upon us, and by the wise and modest question has astringed with apostolic salt
    those who gape for priestly offices, and fun after ordinations <note type="footnote" n="432"

   <p>You are acting rightly and as befits women who profess religion in asking everything without
    shame; for there is one thing only that brings shame, if through sin we come in conflict with
    God's laws, and fall under the <pb n="158"/> judgment of divine wrath. I. Know therefore that a
    woman who has the usual flow of blood ought not to communicate in the divine communion till the
    blood ceases to come. II. On the same principle, in the case of one also who has held the chaste
    intercourse of the couch with a lawful husband, after the same intercourse, it is not in
    accordance with religion that she should for the space of a day receive the most mysterious
    food: for these things increase men's awe and clearness of vision as regards the practice of
    religion and the worship of God.</p>
   <p>In the apostolic injunctions something like this is written about a widow who is appointed in
    the churches: "But, after she enters upon her functions, as has been said, let her not be
    concerned with anything, but be alone, for the purpose of undisturbed prayers; for to such a
    widow solitude is a foundation of holiness and of life: for she has had no pleasure in anyone
    else but the God of gods, the Father in heaven. But at stated times let her give praise apart,
    at night and in the morning. If she have a menstruation, let her remain in the church, but not
    approach the altar; not that she is polluted, but because honour is due to the altar"<note

    of confirmation we have also adduced the answers of the blessed and saintly Timothy, the great
    bishop of Alexandria, who was at the time of the synod of the #one hundred and fifty# bishops,
    which in giving instruction on such matters write for us in agreement with the apostles, and on
    the present point enjoin as follows: Question V; if a woman be with her husband at night,
    whether she ought to receive or not; Answer. "They ought not to receive immediately, since the
    apostle cries: 'Deprive not one another, unless it be by consent for a time' (by 'time' he means
    that which is occupied with communion), 'that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and come
    together again, lest Satan tempt you concerning the lust of incontinence'": and again: Question
    VII; if a believing woman see that which is customary among women, whether she ought to approach
    the mysteries on the same day, or not. Answer. "A religious woman therefore who is about to
    receive of the divine communion ought to prepare herself beforehand before that day, and abstain

   <p>But, as to the kings, hear a story of the holy old men that has been transmitted and has come
    down to us. They said that the religious king Theodosius sent someone secretly to father

     xv. </note> the God-clad old man, begging of him to pray that a male child might be given him:
    and, on the day on which the messenger reached his cell in the desert, it happened that that old
    man died two or three hours before; and, when that man knocked at the door, immediately the old
    man rose up and sat down according to his custom to make a rope<note type="footnote" n="441"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">σειρά</foreign>.</note> of palm-leaves; and he said to
    his disciple, "Bring in the man who knocked": and when he came in he said to him, "Say to
    Theodosius, 'Because God loves you, he will not give you a malakion; for after your reign the
    faith shall be corrupted; and the faith of Nestorius shall prevail, and God does not wish the
    evil to be done through your seed'" (The Egyptians call a male infant malakion, as the
    Byzantines call it <pb n="162"/> philikarion): and, when that man had gone out, that old man
    again lay down and fell asleep and departed to God. This father Nisthora was a celebrated man,
    so that his words are recorded in several of the books which contain tales of the holy old men.

    also leaves them to adopt plans derived from human thoughts, and weapons drawn from nature, in

   <p>For this reason therefore Moses the great was afraid of the king of Egypt and fled, and became
    a sojourner in the land of Midian for 40 years, and again he returned to Egypt, and transfers
    the fear to the king, and he chastised that obstinate and disobedient man with plagues by means
    of the marvellous signs. [And the one] was the effect of the virtue of Moses, that is [the

    queen and a virgin clad in various kinds of flowers and in royal excellencies, and for this
    reason all the more and <note type="footnote" n="463" resp="#ebrooks">This is perh.

    attracting them to her pattern and the example of her chaste life, said, "Virgins shall go to
    the king after her"<note type="footnote" n="464" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. XLIV, 15.</note>. You also
    therefore showed by your writings and acts, after choosing the virgin and angelic life, that is
    free from all material things, that you are walking after the queen and first virgin, the
    church. See therefore that you turn not your looks away, but with all diligence look intently
    and securely and fixedly at her, and cleave to her, in order that, being hard by, you may enter
    the king's temple, which is the expected rest, and the suprasensual bridal-chamber, concerning
    which the same prophet again said, "Holy is thy temple, and wonderful in righteousness"<note

    wonder as something holy and raised above earthly deeds and thoughts, and it cannot be expressed

    right hand for ever"<note type="footnote" n="466" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. xv, 11.</note>. These

    cannot give light<note type="footnote" n="467" resp="#ebrooks"> Matth., xxv, 1-12. </note>. Be

    be tried beyond what we can bear, but with the trial to give also a way of escape, that we may
    be able to endure<note type="footnote" n="468" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. x, 13.</note>. And these

    begotten without beginning by the Father: and the beginning of the letter is this: "You, <pb
     n="177"/> God-loving Eupraxius, are<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">In the heading of the
     extracts at G 8 vo a (p. 180) and G 13o vo b (p. 181) 'being'.</note> smitten with divine
    love": and a little farther on the defence).</note>
   <p>First therefore you seek to learn how we say that God the Word was begotten without beginning
    by the Father. But I from the very appellation 'Father' say that the generation of the Son is
    without beginning. If the Father was from eternity, the Son also, who shows forth the Father,
    existed from eternity: for, if there was a time when the Son did not exist, there was then<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρα</foreign></note> a time when the
    Father was not a father. We, because we are a corruptible nature, come into being in time, and
    again pass away from being: therefore also the names applied to us vary; and at one time we are
    sons of certain persons, and after this we cease to be sons, and we become fathers, and we beget
    others. But God is in his nature invariable, and he is as he is from eternity, and he is a
    father from eternity. And the Son became such to eternity, and the Son is a son who is from
    eternity, and he was begotten everlastingly by the Father, and he did not acquire for the Father
    from outside the status of a father, because the Son was begotten by him without beginning and
    without time. If we say that the Son is the wisdom and the power of the Father in accordance
    with the wise Paul's <pb n="178"/> saying, "Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of
     God"<note type="footnote" n="480">1 Cor. i, 24.</note>, how is it not beyond all impiety for us
    to presume to say that the Father ever appeared without wisdom or without power? But, if he is
    wise from eternity, and he is powerful from eternity, then he has also wisdom and power from
    eternity, which is Christ: for he is the ray of the glory of the Father, and the impress of his
     hypostasis<note type="footnote" n="481">Heb. i, 3.</note>. As the sun from which it. shines is
    the cause of the ray, and the sun is a circle and orb, and, so to speak, a composition, and the
    ray that comes from it is the light that is emitted and lightens everything under heaven, the
    land I mean and the sea at the same time, and one can never see the sun without the ray that
    comes from it, but, when you hear of the sun, then you also without separation think of and
    understand the light that comes from it, that which gives light and that which is lightened by
    it, for it is from it, and is not after it, so also from the everlasting and suprasensual light,
    which is the Father, the Son shone forth without beginning and everlastingly, who himself also
    is the suprasensual ray which proceeds from him by generation, and does not appear after him.
    And, as when we hear the divine Scripture calling the Son a ray, <pb n="179"/> we think of the
    Father from whom, he radiated, so, when we hear that he is the Word of God, according to the
    passage, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God"<note type="footnote" n="482"
     resp="#ebrooks">John i, 1.</note>, we regularly think of the Father who is the subject of the
    Word, who begot the Son from his own nature without passion, the Word so to speak of a great
    intellect, and the messenger in whom he displays and makes known and on whom he impresses the
    hypostasis of the Father, who is a great intellect, and a mind above all . things. And, as our
    mind begets the word without passion, and makes known the thought that is in the heart, and the
    word is a true image of the mind and an exact likeness, and in conjunction with the word, so to
    speak, there proceeds forth, also the emission of the breath of the mouth, in the same way from
    the essence<note type="footnote" n="483" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of the Father also the Son proceeds by way of birth, and the Holy
    Spirit by way of procession. And of the person of the Son who is the wisdom of the Father it is
    written, "I was born before all the mountains"<note type="footnote" n="484" resp="#ebrooks">Pr.,
     viii, 25.</note>, and about the Spirit it is said, "The Holy Spirit which proceedeth from the
     Father"<note type="footnote" n="485" resp="#ebrooks">John XV, 26.</note>. And the divine
    Scripture does not use such words at random, saying that the Son is begotten and the Spirit
    proceeds, <pb n="180"/>
    <note type="footnote" n="486" resp="#ebrooks">In Z this comes in the work of Peter against
     Damian, and, as G (2) has the same version, the compiler must have taken the extracts from the
     Syr. version of Peter's work, not directly from Sev.</note> but that we may not confuse the
    hypostases, and that<note type="footnote" n="487" resp="#ebrooks">The grammar is here
     confused.</note> we may know definitely that the Son is one in his hypostasis, and the Holy
    Spirit another, and that, though they are both from the same essence<note type="footnote"
     n="488" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, and from the same one
    Father, one is begotten and the other proceeds: whence it follows that the Holy Spirit is not
    the Son; for he is not begotten but proceeds. But, if anyone say, "How is the Son begotten, and
    how does the Spirit proceed?", we discreetly say that it is as the Father knows that he begot
    and the Son that he was begotten, and the Spirit that he is from the Father; but this even the
    very angels are not allowed to understand, and we too will not contuse ourselves by
    investigating it. But, inasmuch as we are variable, our mind, being subject to variations and
    changes, emits a word that proceeds and is dissolved in the air<note type="footnote" n="489"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>, and a breath in the same way
    that as soon as it proceeds is diffused over the same air<note type="footnote" n="3"
     resp="#ebrooks"> </note>. But God and the Father, the living and <pb n="181"/> hypostatic mind,
    being incorruptible and invariable, and everlastingly the same, consequently begets a living and
    hypostatic Word, and emits a living and hypostatic Spirit. And, as the Father is the Creator, so
    the Son is the Creator, and the Holy Spirit: for 'by the word of the Lord were the heavens
    established, and by the spirit of his mouth all the strength of them'<note type="footnote"
     n="490">Ps. xxxii, 6.</note>: and, since they are of the same essence<note type="footnote"
     n="491" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of the Father, they are
    of necessity<note type="footnote" n="492" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἀνάγκη</foreign></note> of the same glory and kingship and eternity; for the fact that they
    are of the same essence<note type="footnote" n="491"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> brings with it identity in every respect. And, when we hear of the
    Son, we immediately understand that he himself is of the same essence<note type="footnote"
     n="491" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία. </foreign></note> as the Father; for
    every father certainly begets a son of the same essence<note type="footnote" n="491"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία. </foreign></note> as himself. Thus also from
    every appellation<note type="footnote" n="493" resp="#ebrooks"> (G [1]) ins. 'concerning God'
     and om. 'about the Son'.</note> we draw <pb n="182"/> God-befitting thoughts about the Son,
    from that of 'ray' the thought of co-eternity with the Father, from that of 'Word' impassibility
    of birth, from that of 'Son' the thought of co-essentiality. It is impossible for us in one
    appellation or illustration to comprehend all the attributes that exist in the divine nature,
    because it is without likeness and without peer: but, when we receive from each of the names
    that which is God-befitting, we dismiss all the other things and let them remain below. When we
    speak of the divine nature, we mean the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, separating the
    hypostases, but <pb n="183"/> uniting the Godhead. And, as the name 'Father' and the fact that
    he is not begotten by anything is the peculiar characteristic of the hypostasis of the Father,
    so also the name 'Son' and the fact that he is begotten by the Father is the peculiar
    characteristic of the hypostasis of the Son: similarly also the appellation 'Holy Spirit' and
    the fact that he is not begotten but proceeds from the Father is the peculiar characteristic of
    the hypostasis of the Holy Spirit. While therefore the hypostases or persons are recognised by
    the peculiar characteristics, and the Father is not converted into the Son or the Holy Spirit,
    nor does the Son pass into the Holy Spirit or the Father, nor yet is the Holy Spirit transformed
    so as to become the Father or the Son, the three are one, in that they are of the same
     essence<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> of
     the<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"> (G (3) L) 'and'.</note> Godhead; for the Father is
    God, and the Son God, and the Holy Spirit God, and, while <pb n="184"/> the hypostases remain
    unconfused, the Trinity is invariable in all points: for its essence<note type="footnote"
     n="494" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> is one, its glory one,
    its everlastingness one, its kingship one, its power one, its will one, its operation one, and
    through it we hold that the Trinity is one God. And, though each appears by himself, yet there
    is one Godhead, in the same essence<note type="footnote" n="495" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>. Here some words seem to have fallen out.</note><damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">......</supplied></damage>the Son the fact that he is begotten, and the Spirit the fact that
    he proceeds. And these are from the Father as from a root and we refer their Godhead eternally
    and timelessly to one first cause, to the Father, and so the principle of a single first cause
    is preserved. For we do not hold several first causes, but we reject the Jewish poverty also
    which sees little,, and do not confine the Godhead in one person, and at the same time we know
    and think of three hypostases in one essence<note type="footnote" n="494"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, and one identity of honour, and do not divide it into
    a trinity of first causes, and shun the polytheism of the pagans. (Of Cyril, from the 12th
    chapter of the Treasure. "As the sun is in the ray that proceeds from it, and the ray in the sun
    from which it proceeded, <pb n="185"/> and in the word is the intellect which begot it, and in
    the river the fount that sent it forth, and in the image the original, so the Father is in the
    Son and the Son in the Father, as he says, 'He who hath seen me hath seen the Father', and, 'I
    and my Father are one', and, 'I am in my Father, and my Father in me', being numerically divided
    into a duality, and being so in hypostases, but in that they are one in nature restricted to one
     Godhead")<note type="footnote" n="496" resp="#ebrooks">Thes. 12 (P. G., LXXV, 181, 184, 185),
     put together from several passages. The fact that this citation is introduced without preface
     makes it very doubtful if it is really part of the letter.</note>. Next the second question,
    'Why and in what way do we say that God the Word was humanized?'. The defence. But now it is
    reasonable to consider why and in what way we say that the only Word, the Son of God, was
    humanized; for this is the second question that you put. But we without going outside the divine
    Scriptures say that the reason for which he shone upon and gave light to this world by the
    coming of his Humanization in the flesh was that, as in Adam we die, so in Christ himself we
    might live<note type="footnote" n="497" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xv, 22.</note>, and, as it is
    said, "By man is death, so also by man is the resurrection of the dead"<note type="footnote"
     n="498" resp="#ebrooks"> Ibid., 21.</note>. Since Adam was condemned to death after the
    transgression which was committed through the deceitfulness of the serpent, and heard the words,
     <pb n="186"/> "Dust thou art and to dust shalt thou return", and, "Cursed is the ground in the
    work of thine hands", and, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread", and Eve too was
    also condemned with him by hearing the words, "In pains shalt thou bear children"<note
     type="footnote" n="499" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. iii, 16, 17, 19.</note>, so with us also who are
    sprung from them the charges of disobedience have been confirmed, and we ourselves are dust and
    to dust we return, and we are condemned to the curse and are creatures born in pains: and from
    that time we have been in subjection, being subject to lust and to the varied pleasure of this,
    according to the saying of the blessed Paul<note type="footnote" n="500" resp="#ebrooks">Tit.
     iii, 3.</note>. For it was right that against the cunning contriver of evil, the serpent and
    the destroyer of our life, we should contend with him with the same weapons (?)<note
     type="footnote" n="501" resp="#ebrooks">The substantive has perh. fallen out.</note> with which
    he deceived those founders of our race: and, since it was not the part of another power to annul
    the punishment fixed by our Lord himself, he did not send an envoy nor an angel, but, as Isaiah
    cries, the Lord himself saved us<note type="footnote" n="502" resp="#ebrooks">Is. LXIII,
     9.</note>. The only God the Word who is before the ages, the power and wisdom of the Father, in
    whose image he created rational man, became flesh, I mean man according to the words of
     "John<note type="footnote" n="503" resp="#ebrooks">John I, 14.</note>, not that he was changed
    into flesh (far be it!), but, while he remained invariable as God, he himself assumed the whole
    of me by a true <pb n="187"/> and hypostatic union, but still without the sin which had come in
    upon us<note type="footnote" n="504" resp="#ebrooks">Marg. 'everything that is is included in
     that which has past, and in the things that are present and in the things that are
     future'.</note>. For, immediately after Gabriel had made announcement to the Virgin and said to
    her, "Rejoice greatly, thou that art made glad, the Lord is with thee"<note type="footnote"
     n="505" resp="#ebrooks">Luke i, 28.</note>, at the very moment of time, we believe that God the
    Word himself came to dwell in her womb, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit, and olthe very
    leaven of the holy Virgin, in flesh of our nature possessing an intelligent soul. For he says,
    "That which is born in thee is of the Holy Spirit"<note type="footnote" n="506" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Ibid., 35; Matth., i, 21 (?).</note>, since the Holy Spirit .operatively effected the
    fertilization of the conception, while Mary contributed the birth according to the natural
    manner of mothers. Wherefore also the period of conception was one of nine months (for he says,
    "But, when the days were accomplished that she should bring forth"<note type="footnote" n="507"
     resp="#ebrooks">Luke ii, 6.</note>), and all these things were devoid of phantasy<note
     type="footnote" n="508" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>.</note>,
    since he who was conceived took the seed of Abraham<note type="footnote" n="509" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Heb. II, 16.</note>: for a descendant of Abraham is the Virgin, who also is of our nature,
    from whom the Lord took flesh and became a babe. For he himself became a babe, and the babe was
    not first formed separately, while he afterwards came to be with him by way of indwelling, as
    those who divide him into two natures say. This unsound opinion is <pb n="188"/> rejected by the
    blessed Paul when he says, "For, since the children partook of flesh and blood, he himself also
    similarly partook of the same, in order that through death he might destroy him who hath the
    power of death, who is the devil" <note type="footnote" n="510" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. ii,
     14.</note>. If then<note type="footnote" n="511" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἄρα</foreign>.</note> he partook of flesh and blood similarly to the children and in the same
    way, it is plain that, as the soul of a man is born with its own body, though in its nature it
    is incorporeal, but is nevertheless reckoned to be one with it because of the union, so too he
    who was born is also said to be united to the body that was born that has a rational and
    intelligent soul. And, as you do not say that a man's soul passed into flesh, although it is
    united with the body by an original union, so also no one says that God the Word was changed
    into flesh and endured the process of mingling, because he is hypostatically united to a body.
    Wherefore, when he was born, he made the Virgin the God-bearer, but he did not receive the
    beginning of being God and being held as such from her, but in that he became man. he writes her
    as his mother. But he did not pass from being God, although he took that which he was not; but,
    as he remained that which he is, so also he became truly man. That the body which he united to
     <pb n="189"/> him was not without a soul is certain from the words of the angel: for he said,
    "Rise, take the boy and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought
    the boy's soul"<note type="footnote" n="512" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. ii, 20.</note>: concerning
    which he also said, "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again"<note
     type="footnote" n="513" resp="#ebrooks">John x, 18.</note>. But it was not without intelligence
    and imperfect, according to the statement of the proverbs of Apollinaris, but was in fact
    intelligent, as indeed the very term 'boy' and the fact that he was named 'man' is enough to
    show this same thing: for a boy's soul is not without reason, but it is reasonable because it is
    human. However this very same thing is also clearly shown even by the sacred writings of the
    gospel; for it said of him, "Then he began to be distressed and grieved, and to say, 'My soul is
    sorrowful, even unto death'"<note type="footnote" n="514" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxvi,
     28.</note>. But it is plain to everyone that distress and grief happen to a rational and
    intellectual soul. But, if they say that the Godhead of the Only one took the place of
    intellect, this is in truth a thing without intellect, for us to assign the passion of distress
    to the impassible nature of God. Accordingly the Only God the Word became perfectly man, that he
    might:bestow upon us perfect salvation: for, as soon as he was born, he did away <pb n="190"/>
    the punishment laid upon Eve, who was first led astray by the serpent. If Emmanuel had not been
    born, who is the Word of God who took flesh, who according to the saying of the prophet 'removed
    weeping from all faces'<note type="footnote" n="515" resp="#ebrooks">Is. xxv, 8.</note>, the
    curse, "In pains shalt thou bear children"<note type="footnote" n="516" resp="#ebrooks">Gen.
     iii, 16.</note>, would not have ceased: nevertheless it ceased because God was born. Further
    witness is borne to this by the actual unerring words of the gospel also: for it introduces to
    us the angel saying, "I announce unto you great joy, which belongeth to all the world, that
    to-day there hath been born to us a Saviour, who is the Lord Christ, in the city of David"<note
     type="footnote" n="517" resp="#ebrooks">Luke II, 10, 11.</note>. Mark clearly that, if it were
    not that hé who was born was the Lord, the joy that came to all the world, which is also the joy
    of the whole race of men, the curse, "In pains shalt thou bear children", would not have ceased.
    But, if the birth is the cause of the joy, she who bore is also free from the punishment; and
    thenceforth the joy necessarily passes to those who believe in him: for he said, "Those who
    received him he gave them power to become sons of God"<note type="footnote" n="518"
     resp="#ebrooks">John i. 12.</note>, those who attained to the adoption through the Spirit,
    after he became man.</p>
   <p>And next the third question, as to how we should, understand Paul's <pb n="191"/> saying, "In
    him all the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth bodily"<note type="footnote" n="519" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Col. ii, 9.</note>. The defence.</p>
   <p>In the same God-befitting frame of mind let us also understand (and that is what in your third
    question you thought good to ask) the words which the wise Paul wrote and sent to the Golossians
    about Christ, how that in him all the fulness of the Godhead came to dwell bodily; for we do not
    understand the expression 'in him dwelleth' as the supporters of the impiety of Nestorius wish
    to understand it: for these say that the Word came to dwell in Christ by way of indwelling, as
    in one of the prophets. But, lest any man in consequence of the statement that he came to dwell
    decline from the proper opinion and reckon the Incarnation of the Word a mere indwelling, as
    happened in the case of a man, Paul is sufficient to meet this false tenet when he says that it
    came to dwell in him 'bodily', that is hypostatically and naturally, even as the statement that
    he similarly partook with us of flesh and blood<note type="footnote" n="520" resp="#ebrooks">
     Heb., 11, 14.</note> unconfusedly and immutably, in a Unity that is not dissipated, all
    mingling and phantasy<note type="footnote" n="521" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φαντασία</foreign>.</note> being far from it; for it is alien to a bodiless nature that in
    consequence of its union with a body it should be mingled or changed, a thing which in its
    nature does <pb n="192"/> not touch anything bodily. As to the fact that the word 'dwell' is
    also used of those who are hypostatically united, we have the testimony of the wise Paul
    himself; for in writing to the Corinthians he said, "We know that, even if this our house, our
    tent on earth, is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, that
    abideth for ever in heaven"<note type="footnote" n="522" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. v, 1.</note>. As
    we are said to dwell in a body as in a house, so too God the Word is said to dwell in a body, as
    being hypostatically united to a body that has a rational and intelligent soul. But he said that
    all the fulness of the Godhead dwells, that is, not one operation, nor yet a partial grace of
    the Word himself, as took place in the inspiration of the prophets, but the whole hypostasis of
    the Only one, although he is raised above all limitation, he who imparts tens of thousands of
    operations to others, and distributes graces by way of gifts as from a fountain.</p>
   <p>And again the fourth question, as to how it is that, if we say that the Trinity is one nature,
    and also confess one incarnate nature of God the Word, we do not also say that the Father and
    the Holy Spirit became incarnate with the Son. The defence. <pb n="193"/>
   </p>
   <p>Since you have said that this also is impiously said by some men, that, inasmuch as we believe
    that God the Word was united to flesh, the Father also, inasmuch as he is named as being of the
    same nature, is necesarily said to have become incarnate, and the Holy Spirit also, we fitly say
    what we can and what we have believed, fixing our mind on the divine Scriptures, and not crying
    from the earth according to the prophet's saying<note type="footnote" n="523" resp="#ebrooks">
     Is., xix, 3 (?).</note>, nor yet making up things that come from our heart<note type="footnote"
     n="524" resp="#ebrooks">Jer. xxiii, 16.</note>. But this objection has occurred to them in this
    way. If so be that Christ cries in the gospel, "I am in my Father and my Father in me"<note
     type="footnote" n="525" resp="#ebrooks">John xiv, 10.</note>, and Paul again says that the Son
    is the image of the invisible God<note type="footnote" n="526" resp="#ebrooks">Col. i,
     15.</note>, and the Holy Spirit also the image of the Son, in that he said of those who had
    been admitted to the adoption as sons by the Spirit, "they became conformed to the image of his
     Son"<note type="footnote" n="527">Rom. viii, 29.</note>, that it might be shown as following
    from this that the Holy Trinity is one essence<note type="footnote" n="528" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, when it is said that the Son became
    incarnate, how can we not also allow that the Father and the Holy Spirit too became incarnate,
    inasmuch as they are in the Son and appear in him? This is what these say. But we say with
    intelligence: These, my good men, are the words of those who confuse the hypostases. But, if the
    Father is the Father, he never passes <pb n="194"/> into the Son, and the Holy Spirit also
    remains fixedly and without transformation in his own hypostasis, and does not pass into the
    hypostasis of the Son: but the divine Scriptures have said that the Son became incarnate and
    became man, and it is on account of the co-essentiality that, the Father and the Holy Spirit are
    said to be in him, not in order that we may dissolve and confound the hypostasis of the Father
    and of the Holy Spirit in the Son. But, if the Son is the image of the Father, the very name
    'image' shows that it is understood to be the image of another hypostasis separate from itself:
    for, if it is an image, it is an image of some one, and, because it is an unvarying image in all
    points, it is not therefore the person himself of whom it is an image; for, if it were the
    person himself, it would fail to . be an image, for of whom would it be an image? Suppose a man
    delineates and copies a design and pattern from an original tablet on to another, and draws it
    correctly in all points, and makes the copy like the original, in no <pb n="195"/> point falling
    short of the pattern that was first designed, but makes the colour and form<note type="footnote"
     n="529" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα</foreign>.</note> and stature and size
    and pose of the limbs also alike, and those who see it for the first time do not know, if one
    may so say, which is the original from which it was drawn and designed, on account of the exact
    resemblance of the appearance in both, and after this he takes the copy and fixes it on a wall,
     then<note type="footnote" n="530" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄρα</foreign>.</note>
    will anyone of right understanding say that the original tablet has been fixed on the wall,
    because it is a copy of it and contains all that belongs to the original pattern? So we say that
    the Son became incarnate, the true image of the Father, who has by nature everything that
    belongs to his begetter, and we do not on this account hold that the Father became incarnate,
    who appears in his own special hypostasis or person. <pb n="196"/> What has been said is
    intended as an indication of the subject, in order that the understanding may receive a
    defective and obscure example, because the whole force of the example does not follow in the
    footsteps of the truth, since here the image is without soul and immoveable, and is limited by
    the appearance of colours, but above there is a living and moveable image, suprasensual and
    unlimited and without appearance<note type="footnote" n="531" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα</foreign>.</note>, and possessing immutability by nature. But, if we look
    into the divine Scriptures, we may through the mystery that has been richly revealed in them by
    another example also reįoive an illustration of what is stated. It is everywhere known that our
     speech<note type="footnote" n="532" resp="#ebrooks">Word.</note> is the offspring of our mind,
    and not the offspring only, but also the clear image, which represents the disposition<note
     type="footnote" n="533" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διάθεσις</foreign>.</note> that
    is in the depths of the mind, and with the speech comes forth also the <pb n="197"/> breath<note
     type="footnote" n="534" resp="#ebrooks">Spirit.</note> of the mouth. The example is defective,
    and is a kind of similitude and shadow of the truth itself for those who are able to listen
    properly and intelligently. However, as our speech comes out through the organ<note
     type="footnote" n="535" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄργανον</foreign>.</note> of
    the voice and moves the hearing and passes inside him who hears, and no one says that the speech
    which is begotten by the mind, exists hypostatically, the speech which enters into the hearing
    of him who hears, or says that the breath which comes out in the speech through the voice exists
    in hypostasis <note type="footnote" n="536" resp="#ebrooks">I cannot render this otherwise, but
     do not follow the argument.</note>, but only calls it a help to the hearing, so understand also
    with regard to the mystery of God the Word, because he himself alone hypostatically and
    ineffably and as he himself only knows came to dwell in the Virgin's womb and became incarnate
    from her, and neither the Father his begetter nor the Spirit which proceeds shared in this, but
    according to the saying of John, "The Word became flesh, and he was God, and was with God"<note
     type="footnote" n="537" resp="#ebrooks"> John, i, 1, 14.</note>, as one with another, because
    the hypostases exist severally. Since then these things are so, that question of theirs which
    arises from ignorance <pb n="198"/> is superfluous and vain, a question that amounts to actual
    impiety. "If" (they say) "you say that the Trinity is one nature, and say that there is one
    nature of the incarnate Word, how are you not driven to saying that the whole Trinity became
    incarnate?" I am surprised at the cunning rusticity of those men, as shown by the way in which
    they display courage without consideration against the right opinion. We<note type="footnote"
     n="538" resp="#ebrooks">Cf. ep. 6.</note> use the name 'nature' sometimes generally of
     'essence'<note type="footnote" n="539" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note>, and sometimes specifically signifying the hypostasis of a man. We
    term all mankind one nature, as in the text "Every nature of beasts and of birds and of things
    that are in the water is subjected and made subject to human nature"<note type="footnote"
     n="540" resp="#ebrooks">James iii, 7.</note>: and again we call a man 'nature', Paul for
    instance or Peter or James. Where we name all mankind one nature, we use the name 'nature'
    generically in place of 'essence': but, where we speak of one nature of Paul, we employ the name
    'nature' in place of 'individual hypostasis'. So also, when we say that the Holy Trinity is one
    nature, as in the text, "In order that we may be sharers of the divine nature"<note
     type="footnote" n="541" resp="#ebrooks">2 Pet. i, 4</note>, we use the name 'nature' in place
    of the general <pb n="199"/> designation 'essence'<note type="footnote" n="542" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note>. And to say that the Holy Trinity is one
    nature is the same as to say that it is one Godhead, as we are in fact accustomed to call all
    mankind one nature. But, when we say 'one incarnate nature of God the Word', we say 'nature' in
    place of an individual designation, and thereby we denote the one actual hypostasis of the Word,
    like that of Paul or Peter or any single man. Therefore also, when we say one nature which
    became incarnate', we do not say so absolutely, but we say 'one nature of the Word himself, and
    clearly denote that it is one hypostasis. But again let no one stain the divine nature that is
    raised above all things with anything lowly taken from the example of Paul and Peter. For,
    although they are of the same essence, they differ not only in hypostases, but also in power and
    operation, and stature and shape, and in the various kinds of impulses that are in men's minds.
    The Holy Trinity however differs by the difference of hypostases only, and in every point is
    unvarying in equality, and in the fact that it is of the same essence. And avoid that poverty of
    the example which is not worthy of the Godhead, and do not conceive of the Word as without
    hypostasis, nor yet of the Spirit as being dissipated in the air<note type="footnote" n="543"

   <p>Next the fifth question, as to how the Only one, who is a quickening blessing, was termed a
     curse<note type="footnote" n="544" resp="#ebrooks">Gal. iii, 13.</note>. The defence.</p>
   <p>We will now go on to give you an answer with regard to the fifth question also, how the Only
    one, who is a quickening blessing, was termed a curse. If he became man to free our race from
    the bonds of former crimes, and took upon him the seed of Abraham, and flesh of our nature, and
    united a human soul to himself hypostatically, therefore he made all the debts of our race to
    which we were liable his own: for we are accursed, and we came under, the penalty of the curse,
    and heard the words, "Dust thou art and to dust shalt thou return", and, "Cursed is the earth in
    the work of thine hands", and, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread"<note
     type="footnote" n="545" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. iii, 17, 19. </note>; and he became the
    firstfruits of our nature. For in that he took upon him the seed of Abraham he is consequently
    said to have become<note type="footnote" n="546">We rather require 'been subject to'; but an
     emendation cannot be made without violent alteration. But cf. p. 202, 1. 10. </note> those
    things to which our nature was subject. Nor yet was he subject to these things for a moment of
    time, but rather after they had been vainly applied to him he destroyed them. Just as the sun
    when it shines in a gloomy and dark house, as soon as it puts forth its ray, dispels the
    darkness, since it itself is not affected <pb n="201"/> by darkness, in the same way also the
    Only God the Word, the Sun of righteousness, as soon as he approached our nature, also dispelled
    the curse. For the holy Virgin, who conceived with the divine and incorruptible conception,
    immediately heard from Elizabeth who had been divinely moved, that is the servant of the
    Baptist, the words, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And
    whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"<note type="footnote"
     n="547" resp="#ebrooks">Luke i, 42, 43.</note>. If she had not known that it was the Lord who
    was conceived of the God-bearer Mary, she would not have cried, "Blessed is the fruit of thy
    womb". In agreement with this our Lord himself also in his words dispelled the curse, that the
    earth might no more be 'cursed in the work of thine hands', saying, "Work not the food that
    perisheth, but the food that abideth in eternal life, which the Son of man will give you", and
    not, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread", but, "I am the bread of life which
    came down from heaven, and if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever", and no more,
    "Dust thou art and to dust shalt thou return", but, "This is the will of my Father, that
    everyone who seeth the Son and believeth on him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up
    at the last day"<note type="footnote" n="548" resp="#ebrooks">John vi, 27, 40, 51.</note>. You
    see that on all points by <pb n="202"/> being himself made a curse he becomes a dispeller of the
    curse, and this curse he takes up on to the cross, and thence puts it to flight: for it was
    overcome by the law which said, "Cursed of God is everyone who shall be hanged upon wood"<note
     type="footnote" n="549" resp="#ebrooks">Deut. xxi, 23. </note>. And he himself underwent the
    accursed death that was for our sake, and thence blessed the whole human race; and the blessed
    Paul bears witness who writes to the Galatians and says, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of
    the law, and became a curse for our sake, because it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is
    hanged upon wood', in order that the blessing of Abraham might be among the nations in Jesus
     Christ"<note type="footnote" n="550" resp="#ebrooks">Gal. iii, 13, 14.</note>. So also he is
    said to have become sin<note type="footnote" n="551" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. v, 21.</note>,
    because he endured the death that was the due of sinners; for, while he is himself the pure
    justice of the Father, he is crucified between two robbers; but these on account of their
    offences, and in accordance with the passage in the Gospel of Mark who says, "And with him they
    crucified two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left, and the Scripture was
    fulfilled which saith, 'He was numbered with the unjust'"<note type="footnote" n="552"
     resp="#ebrooks">Mark xv, 27, 28.</note>. So he became sin to remit the sins of others: so also
    he paid the debt that was incurred for us, and we ourselves became righteousness in him; for
    those who have been freed from debts are righteous, and <pb n="203"/> are not termed liable.
    And, because during the time of his Humanization he did no sin, therefore also iniquity was not
    found in him, but he showed himself righteous, that is, he is righteousness; and, when he became
    flesh, all our nature again was justified in him as in firstfruits; and this is what the wise
    Paul said to the Corinthians about the Father, "He made him sin for our sake, who knew no sin,
    that we might be the righteousness of God in him"<note type="footnote" n="553" resp="#ebrooks">2
     Cor. v, 21.</note>. This too was carried out in the ritual of the law also; for the two goats
    on whom lots were laid were a type of Christ our Saviour, who is made up of two elements, the
    perfect Godhead I mean and the manhood: and the one, on whom the Lord's lot fell, was
    slaughtered, while the other was dismissed into the wilderness that is not passed,, who also was
    named 'the dismissible', who gained the appellation also from the fact itself; for he was
    dismissed, but was hot simply dismissed, but in the manner which Scripture mentioned; for it
    said as follows: "And thou shalt bring the living goat, and Aaron shall lay his two hands on the
    head of the living goat, and shall confess over him all the sin of the sons of Israel, and all
    their wickedness and their iniquity, and shall lay them on the head of the living goat, and
    shall dismiss him by means of a man who is ready into the wilderness; <pb n="204"/> and the goat
    shall take upon him all their iniquity"<note type="footnote" n="554" resp="#ebrooks">Lev. xvi,
     20-22.</note>. This therefore was thus performed in the case of the two goats also, that the
    one was slaughtered and the other dismissed. We clearly see the hidden meaning which relates to
    the Cross: for the type denotes that the same one Christ suffered in the flesh, but remained
    without suffering in that he is considered to he true God. For the same person both is separated
    by lots to the Lord and slaughtered (for 'he delivered himself for our sake as an offering and a
    sacrifice to God the Father for a sweet savour'<note type="footnote" n="555" resp="#ebrooks">
     Eph., v, 2.</note>), and goes away without suffering bearing the sins of all Israel, which in
    the type of Aaron were confessed over the head of the goat: for he clearly displays himself as
    being himself true God, over whom we confess our sins according to law; for "I will make
    confession", he saith, "unto thee, Lord, concerning my sins, and thou wilt forgive the
    wickedness of my heart"<note type="footnote" n="556" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. xxxi, 5.</note>; for,
    though 'he was led as a lamb to the slaughter', yet, 'who shall tell his generation, because his
    life is taken away from the earth?'<note type="footnote" n="557" resp="#ebrooks"> Is., LIII, 7,
     8.</note>, for he is without descent as God, and he is life in his nature, for he was taken
    away and lifted up from the earth. Truly is it said of him in reference to the type that he
    shall be dismissed into the wilderness that is not passed; for that country is impassable to all
    outside <pb n="205"/> nature, and is passable to him who became incarnate only, I mean the
    throne of the kingdom, on which he sits at the Father's right hand, bearing our sins; for so too
    John also the loud-voiced preacher and ambassador of the Word himself cried and said, "Behold!
    the Lamb of God who beareth the sin of the world"<note type="footnote" n="558" resp="#ebrooks"
     >John i, 29.</note>. For the same person is termed at one time a goat, at another a lamb; and
    he shows that he came to suffer not only for the sake of sinners, but also for the sake of the
    righteous; for death reigned 'even over those who had not sinned' also, as Paul also said<note
     type="footnote" n="559" resp="#ebrooks">Rom. v, 14.</note>. Accordingly the lamb is the type of
    the righteous, and the goat of sinners; for the righteous stand as lambs on the right hand, and
    the sinners as goats on the left. Let no one think- that through the symbol of the two goats he
    shows us two Christs, one passible and the other impassible, but one and the same, passible in
    the flesh, but impassible in his Godhead. For indeed one goat only was not sufficient to signify
    what was signified with two (how was it possible for the same to be slaughtered and not
    slaughtered?), to show that Christ tasted death in the flesh, and in his Godhead is raised above
    suffering. Is it not plain therefore that another goat is necessarily taken, in order that the
    one fact may be perfectly revealed symbolically in <pb n="206"/> the two? Just as a painter,
    when he depicts the story of Abraham, depicts him several times, now hearing God saying to him,
    "Offer thy son to me as a burnt-sacrifice", now cutting faggots, now again binding Isaac and
    laying him on the faggots, now with his hand armed with the knife and stretched out to slay and
    held back by the heavenly voice coming from above, and we do not think the one Abraham to be
    many because the same person was depicted many times, and indeed one picture was not sufficient
    to tell the whole story, so also for the shadowy representation of the symbol, for the sake of
    perfectly setting forth the fact, two goats were taken, and we do not divide the one Christ into
    two, but we declare him to be one out of two natures, the perfect Godhead and the manhood,
    according to the faith of the divine Scriptures, and the words of the fathers that are inspired
    by the Spirit, from which sources we also speak these things. That the two goats symbolized the
    one Christ is plain from the allegory of the lots; for the priest Aaron did not select one of
    the goats at haphazard to be slaughtered, but committed the matter to the uncertainty of lots,
    that by this he might show the primary unity of God the Word and his flesh. As he is himself God
     <pb n="207"/> impassible and free, but by reason of the union with a body possessing a rational
    soul was condemned to death, though in his nature he is immortal, so also the one goat who was
    to be dismissed to the wilderness symbolized the impassibility of the Godhead of the Only one,
    and was under the decree of slaughter; for the lot cast over him, whether he was to be
    slaughtered or dismissed, was uncertain. Accordingly it is plain that the two goats signify the
    one Christ, and that the same suffered in the flesh, and, in that he is God, remained raised
    above sufferings. Nor yet let anyone, imitating the madness of the heathen, imagine that the
    dismissed goat was set apart and dismissed to the wilderness for some demon; for this is a
    departure from the laws of Moses, inasmuch as he said, "Hear, Israel. The Lord thy God is one
    Lord", and again, "Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve, and to him
    shalt thou draw near, and in his name shalt thou swear", and, "Thou shalt not go after other
     gods"<note type="footnote" n="560">Deut. vi, 4, 13, 14.</note>; and again in another place,
    "And ye shall not make mention of the name of other gods, and it shall not be heard from your
    mouth"; and again, "Thou shalt not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their
    deeds, but shalt utterly overturn them and destroy their pillars, and shalt serve the Lord <pb
     n="208"/> thy God only"<note type="footnote" n="561" resp="#ebrooks">Ex. xxiii, 13, 24,
     25.</note>. How then should he in the same mind break in pieces and overturn their pillars (and
    he did not allow the name of other gods to be mentioned at all beside the one Lord God), and on
    the other hand separate the goat to another beside him as to some evil fiend, and propitiate
    this fiend in this way? But it is plain that the two goats were offered in order to honour one
    God only, and completed the symbolic allegory which we have already mentioned, and two lots were
    cast, and one was slaughtered to the Lord, and the other was dismissed after the manner of the
    separation of the lots, and therefore he was called 'the dismissible'. If he had said, "One goat
    to the Lord, and one goat to the dismissible", perhaps their charge would have derived some
    plausibility from the divine Scripture, because it said, "One lot to the Lord, and one to the
    dismissible"; for it is plain that the one was separated for the purpose of slaughter, and the
    other was dismissed to the Lord, not to another different from him; for this is what the divine
    Scripture said, "And he shall set' the living one before the Lord, in order to dismiss him in
     dismissal"<note type="footnote" n="562" resp="#ebrooks">Lev. xvi, 10. I do not follow the
     argument in this passage.</note>. But some of the learned Hebrews, that is rather those who are
    earlier than those who are of the Hebrews, said <pb n="209"/> "One lot to the Lord, and one lot
    to him that was dismissed"<note type="footnote" n="563" resp="#ebrooks"> I do not know the
     source of this quotation.</note>, in order that in all points and that even from the very
    imagination of the heathen, or, to speak fittingly, from their lack of instruction, it might be
    seen that their charge against the holy laws of Moses is without plausibility. For those who
    after the Christian religion were lifted up in philosophy, and endeavoured to adorn
    demon-worship in a reverend fashion<note type="footnote" n="564" resp="#ebrooks">Julian
     (?).</note>, as they themselves say on behalf of others, say of their god who is called
    'mblkhywn, "We should not sacrifice to the gods, but by purity of mind propitiate and honour
     them"<note type="footnote" n="563" resp="#ebrooks">I do not know the source of this
     quotation.</note>: but men who were fettered in the same chain as they said that men should
    sedulously offer sacrifices to the evil spirits who delight in blood, not that they may help,
    but that they may not injure<note type="footnote" n="565" resp="#ebrooks">Porphyry, De Abstin.,
     ii, 37 ff.; De sacrificiis et diis atque daemonibus, ap. Iamblichum, ed. Ficinus (1577), p.
     317. </note>. If then Moses separated and dismissed one of the goats to a demon, according to
    the madness of those men he ought to have ordered this goat to be slaughtered to the demon, and
    he who is pleased by blood ought to have rejoiced in his blood. But now the exact contrary is
    the case: the one who was set apart to God Most High was slaughtered, while the other, the
    dismissible, or, as they wish to say. the one who was separated to an evil <pb n="210"/> demon,
    was dismissed into the wilderness without blood and without sacrifice. By all these arguments
    the ingenious madness of the heathen has been refuted, who wished to stain the divine Scripture
    with the blame of their cults of many demons, men who did not shrink from calling the usual
    sacrifices to their idols 'dismissible', in order to substantiate their error by a plausible
    identity of name. These things we have stated shortly in the desire to show how Jesus became sin
    for us, that we might in him become the righteousness of God. He endured a death that was for
    our sake, he who for the sins of us all became one that is subject, he who knows not sin, for
    according to the prophet's saying, "He came to death for the sins of my people, and for our sake
    he suffered pain, and was smitten, and he endured sickness for our iniquity"<note
     type="footnote" n="566" resp="#ebrooks">Is. LIII, 5 (loose quotation).</note>. So also Paul
    wrote to the Hebrews and said, "Christ was offered once, that he might bear the sins of many" ,
    and he says that 'by his sacrifice he hath been revealed once for all at the last for the doing
    away of sin', and 'he offered one eternal offering for our sins'<note type="footnote" n="567"
     resp="#ebrooks">Heb. ix, 26, 28; x, 12. </note>: and Peter the eminent among the apostles said,
    "The same carried up our sins in his body on to the cross, that we, being freed from sins, might
    live in righteousness"<note type="footnote" n="568" resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. ii, 24.</note>.</p>
   <p>And again the sixth question, as to how we say that the same suffered in <pb n="211"/> the
    flesh, and in his Godhead remained without suffering, and, while we do not make him alien to
    suffering, we keep him without suffering. The defence. Now we will give a sufficient answer to
    that question also, how we say that the same suffered in the flesh, and did not suffer in the
    Godhead, and, while we do not make him alien to suffering, we keep him without suffering. On the
    same subject we will lay before you an example which has come to us from our fathers. The force
    of examples is in truth small, and far removed from the truth; nevertheless, if only in some
    thin and shadowy phantasies<note type="footnote" n="569" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φαντασίας</foreign>.</note>, it offers to the understanding a beginning of conceptions. As,
    when iron or another similar substance<note type="footnote" n="570" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note> is abundantly warmed by fire, and is heated by flame, we
    know that, while the iron does not pass out of its own nature, the iron which has passed into a
    complete flame, and has been made to hiss and to glow by it, it appears to be all fire, and,
    while it is in this state, blows are applied to it, it being smitten by a hammer or by means of
    other kinds of strokes, but the iron is exposed to the blows themselves, being expanded and
    narrowed at the same time, while the nature of the fire is in no way injured by the smiter, so
    must we also understand the mystery <pb n="212"/> concerning Christ also, even although all the
    power of speech shrinks, from the glory of the fact. He was hypostatically united to a body with
    a rational and intelligent soul, but he permitted it to suffer naturally from the blows of
    pains, I mean on the cross, when he might have deadened these also as God, but he was not
    desirous of this, for it was not for himself, but for our race, that he was purchasing the
    successes of victory. Therefore he permitted his body to suffer, while even he himself also was
    not alien from suffering, for he was united to a suffering body, and, as it is his body, so also
    it is called his suffering; nevertheless as God he remained without suffering, for God is not
    touched by suffering. He is said also to have tasted death for us, in that his soul was
    separated from his body; not that his soul was cut away from his Godhead, or his body left
    without Godhead; but he showed that he was in both without separation, for neither was his soul
    left in Sheol, nor did his flesh see corruption<note type="footnote" n="571" resp="#ebrooks">Ps.
     xv, 10.</note>, according to the saying of the Psalmist. For he was not separated from his body
    that was buried, and therefore he annihilated corruption; for, if it had been separated from him
    who is life and incorruption, perhaps it would have been constantly <pb n="213"/> attacked by
    corruption also. For he went down into Sheol with his soul also, the whole of him being in it,
    and the whole of him in his body without separation, as one that is incorporeal and is able to
    fill everything as one that is infinite. It was necessary for him to give light even to the
    lower regions also, and to have mercy on the souls there imprisoned, and, according to the
    saying of the prophet, "to say to those that are in bonds, 'Come forth', and to those also that
    are in darkness, 'Be revealed'"<note type="footnote" n="572" resp="#ebrooks"> Is., XLIX,
     9.</note>. This he accomplished in action. The gates of Sheol which saw him trembled, and he
    broke the bars of iron and gates of bronze<note type="footnote" n="573" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. cvi,
     16.</note>, and opened Paradise which was shut, and "many bodies of just men among those who
    had fallen asleep came out of their graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city,
    and appeared to many"<note type="footnote" n="574" resp="#ebrooks"> Matth., xxvii, 53.</note>.
    Very properly the evangelist added, 'after his resurrection'; for it was necessary that he who
    is life in his nature should himself first begin the resurrection, and that the very one who was
    able to dissolve the power of death should himself tread the way for the rest who came after
    him. He did not deal arbitrarily with the devil, the same who led the first man astray, when he
    was defeated as by God, but, as one who is just and 'taketh the wise in their craftiness'<note
     type="footnote" n="575" resp="#ebrooks">Job, v, 13.</note>, he brought the <pb n="214"/> crafty
    one into subjection by means of his devices. He who led Adam astray and said to him, "You will
    be a god, if you transgress the law", fell by the device of craft. He fought with the second
    Adam who is Christ, and found him to be God and man at the same time; and he won a just victory
    over him; and henceforth we confidently sing songs of praise for his victory over death and say,
    "Where is thy victory, death? and where is thy sting, Sheol?" For Paul says that 'the sting of
    death is sin'<note type="footnote" n="576" resp="#ebrooks">I Cor. xv, 55, 56.</note>.</p>
   <p>Next the seventh question, why the law was given to the fathers that they should circumcise
    their foreskin. The defence.</p>
   <p>Now we pass on to discuss the subject of circumcision. This<note type="footnote" n="577"
     resp="#ebrooks">This passage to 'kin' (p. 215,1.1) is published in Greek in Cramer, Cat. in
     Act. Apost., p. 108.</note> is what you ask, "Why was the law given to the fathers that they
    should circumcise their foreskin?" Some have simply and easily handed down a reason like this.
    They say, "Because Abraham migrated from the land of the Chaldees, and the Chaldees were
    permitted (and the same was the case too with the Medes and Persians also) according to the
    custom of their fathers to have intercourse with their mothers and sisters, for this reason
    therefore he circumcised his foreskin, that he might shun kindred flesh, <pb n="215"/> and
    renounce marriage with those of his kin, and on this account God gave the law to the sons of
    Israel through Moses and said, 'A man shall not go in to any that is related to him in the flesh
    to uncover his shame'<note type="footnote" n="578" resp="#ebrooks">Lev. XVIII, 6. What follows
     to 'ever' (1. 6) is in Cramer, l. c., headed <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετ᾽
     ὀλίγα</foreign>.</note>". And others say that the reason why Abraham was commanded to
    circumcise his progeny also besides was that it might be plain that Christ should come of them
    in the flesh who is God over all for ever and ever. But, if you please, we will pass from these
    reasons; for it is known that the Egyptians also as well and other nations circumcise their
    foreskin, even although they imitated the Hebrews; and we state that which is true and befits
    God the lawgiver, and that is very sublime and to which testimony is borne by the Scriptures,
    that circumcision promises renunciation of fleshly birth, and acquisition of the adoption of the
    Spirit, by which we are called sons of God; for it is written, "Thus saith the Lord, 'Israel is
    my son, my firstborn'"<note type="footnote" n="579" resp="#ebrooks">Ex. iv, 22.</note>. After
    the fall from Paradise and the' destruction of immortality, Adam knew Eve, and she conceived and
    bare; and this unstable intercourse, intercourse befitting beasts, was given for the propagation
    of our race, it being a kind of healing of the sickness, that the race of men might <pb n="216"
    /> not be cut off through death. The woman was not at first given to Adam for the sake of the
    procreation of children, but that she might be a helper to him; for the Lord God said, "It is
    not good for Adam to be alone; let us make him a helper like to him"<note type="footnote"
     n="580" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. II, 18.</note>. He did not say from the beginning that he would
    make her be fruitful and multiply, in order that by means of fertility the race might go on to
    multiplication; for God might have done this even without the intercourse of marriage, and have
    made our race increase and multiply like the myriads of angels, as the Lord himself actually
    said in a place in the gospel, "In the resurrection there is no marriage, nor yet are they
    joined in marriage, but they will be as the angels in heaven"<note type="footnote" n="581"
     resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxii, 30.</note>. If anyone says, "What is the help that the woman was
    to give the man?", we easily say: In the worship in Paradise and in the keeping of the law; as
    Solomon also said of a similar woman, "Who can find a manly woman?"<note type="footnote" n="582"
     resp="#ebrooks">Pr., xxix, 28.</note>, and again another wise man says, "A manly woman
    gladdeneth her husband", and, "A good woman is a good portion<note type="footnote" n="583"
     resp="#ebrooks">Sir., xxvi, 2, 3.</note>": and for this reason they also received the law in
    common, that through union and conjunction of breath<note type="footnote" n="584">This probably
     represents some Greek compound (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁμοπνοία</foreign>?).</note> they might
    be cautious, and not liable to be overcome by the <pb n="217"/> deceit of the serpent; for he
    said to them, "Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ye shall not eat of it; but in the day
    in which ye shall eat of it ye shall die"<note type="footnote" n="585">Gen. ii, 17.</note>. For,
    as long as they kept the law, and rejoiced with one another without passion, and did not
    perceive one another's nakedness, and also did not think of their union in marriage, they
    enjoyed the blessed life in Paradise itself. But, when the woman gave up the duty of help, and
    like a weak person out of simplicity accepted the deceitful counsel of the serpent, then she
    herself also became an evil counsellor to the man, and immediately they were alien to God, and
    also to the life in Paradise, and by means of death were condemned; and Adam knew his wife, and
    she becomes a helper to him in the second line, through the procreation of children<note
     type="footnote" n="586" resp="#ebrooks">Cf. ep. 63.</note>. And at first she was given him as a
    helper in the worship in Paradise; for such is God's care for us that, even when we change, he
    continues to help us: for he made man his own master, and to honour that which is good; and,
    having foreseen that he would change, he provided a helper for him beforehand. Therefore also
    Adam by the grace of God, as soon as the woman was created, foretold that a man should 'leave
    his father and his <pb n="218"/> mother, and cleave to his wife, and they two should be one
     flesh'<note type="footnote" n="587" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. ii,24.</note>. This bodily birth
    circumcision renounces, which was given after the fall from the life in Paradise in the
    character of a remedy, and causes us to approach to the impassibility which existed during the
    residence in Paradise; by which we are named sons of God, inasmuch as it slays our members upon
    the earth, and puts off from us the old man. The truth itself, of which circumcision is a type,
    testifies to us; for Paul wrote to the Colossians and said that circumcision in Christ is
    baptism, whereby we put away from us our old man, and the mortality wherein we died after our
    fall from Paradise, and we also cut away the bodily desire as it were a kind of foreskin, and
    bury it in the waters which slay sin, and in the same way we are buried with Christ, and rise as
    new men and born afresh, and hasten to the new and; passionless life; for this is what Paul
    wrote: "In whom ye were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, by stripping off
    the body of your flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, and were buried with him in baptism, and
    rose in him through faith in the operation of God who raised him from the place of the dead; and
    you also, who had died in your sins and in the foreskin of your flesh, he quickened <pb n="219"
    /> with him, and he forgave you all your sins"<note type="footnote" n="588" resp="#ebrooks">Col.
     ii, 11-13.</note>. You see that circumcision is the destruction of the foreskin, and contains a
    renunciation of fleshly birth and of the body's pleasure in mortality; for it confesses the
    passionless and new-fashioned life, as the actual truth of baptism showed, of which circumcision
    is a type, which in a shadow cuts away the foreskin of the flesh, while baptism cuts away the
    foreskin of the soul, and, so to speak, destroys its excessive wickedness. Such was the legal
    ceremony, and the covenant with Abraham, and of<note type="footnote" n="589" resp="#ebrooks">Sic
     Syr.</note> his descendants, which by the ancients was carried out in a bodily and sensual
    fashion, but signified beforehand the allegorical conceptions, which the spiritual and
    suprasensual ceremony in Christ revealed and brought to pass, for through baptism we are
    circumcised with a suprasensual circumcision, and receive in our mind the privilege of being no
    longer sons of the flesh, for we are named sons of God. Hear what John the thunder and trumpet
    of the divine words says, "For those who received him he gave them power to become sons of God,
    those who believed on his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of
     God"<note type="footnote" n="590" resp="#ebrooks">John i, 12, 13.</note>. Joshua<note
     type="footnote" n="591" resp="#ebrooks">Syr. 'Jesus'.</note> also the son of Nun, who typified
    Jesus who is God and our Saviour, shows this clearly, that circumcision is the baptism which is
     <pb n="220"/> perfected in Christ, and was given to the sons of Israel as to a kind of sons
    without passibility; but, because they had lived forty years in the wilderness, it happened that
    the sons who were begotten by them remained uncircumcised, though it was possible for them to
    circumcise. But this did not happen by chance, but because God was directing this matter in
    order to reveal the future mystery; and neither did Moses circumcise them, the exact observer of
    the fathers' customs, who ordered that anyone who collected sticks on the sabbath-day should
     die<note type="footnote" n="592" resp="#ebrooks">Num. xv, 32-35.</note>, who knew all things
    beforehand, and among them the threat pronounced by God who said, "Whoever is not circumcised in
    the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall perish from among its people,
    because it hath set at naught my covenant"<note type="footnote" n="593" resp="#ebrooks">Gen.
     xvii, 14.</note>; nor yet did Joshua<note type="footnote" n="594" resp="#ebrooks">Syr. '
     Jesus'.</note> again, who succeeded to the government after Moses, circumcise them before they
    crossed Jordan; but, after they had crossed Jordan, then he took knives of rock and cut away
    their foreskins from them. And this is plain, that he who has crossed Jordan and by the laver is
    admitted to regeneration is circumcised with a rock-knife, which is Christ: for "the <pb n="221"
    /> Word of God is living, and effectual and sharp beyond a two-edged knife"<note type="footnote"
     n="595" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. iv, 12.</note>; and according to Paul's saying Christ also is a
     rock<note type="footnote" n="596" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. x, 4.</note>. Let no one hold the
    unreasonable supposition that they had no iron-knives in the wilderness; for they were armed,
    and slew those who opposed them. Mark again the same type in other mysteries also; for the
    blessed Paul said, "Those who were baptized in Christ were baptized in his death"<note
     type="footnote" n="597" resp="#ebrooks">Rom. vi, 3.</note>, and. Joshua<note type="footnote"
     n="598" resp="#ebrooks">Syr. 'Jesus'.</note> the son of Nun presents the same figure, for he
    provided that the knives with which he circumcised the sons of Israel should be buried with him,
    that thereby he might show that those who are baptized in the name of Jesus the true God with
    the baptism that is completed in his death are by it circumcised. And, when we examine the sense
    of Scripture, we find an unlimited abundance of thoughts, and a primary union and agreement of
    the types with the truth, and praise the one God, the giver of the two covenants<note
     type="footnote" n="599" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαθήκας</foreign>.</note>.
    And, as to the manner again in which we on being admitted to the divine laver and regeneration
    and putting off from us our old man are both invited by Christ to the mystic table and eat the
    angelic heavenly bread, Joshua the son of Nun himself again showed us this mystery. For, <pb
     n="222"/> after they had crossed the Jordan and been circumcised with knives of rock, then for
    the first time those who were circumcised ate of the wheat of the land of promise, and
    celebrated the Passover, not with the old leaven, but with the pure true leavens: and, as, when
    Jesus Christ ate the legal Passover with his disciples, and thereby fulfilled the law, and took
    the bread of thanksgiving in the midst, and blessed<note type="footnote" n="600" resp="#ebrooks"
     > (G (2) L) 'blessed in the midst the eucharistia and'.</note> the cup, and put an end to the
    legal Passover, the new<note type="footnote" n="601" resp="#ebrooks">A.v, (G (1))
     'spiritual'.</note> suprasensual sacrifice received a beginning and entrance, so also, when
     Joshua<note type="footnote" n="602" resp="#ebrooks">Syr. 'Jesus'.</note> the son of Nun as in a
    kind of prefigurement and type kneaded<note type="footnote" n="603" resp="#ebrooks">A. v. (G
     (1)) ins. 'and made'.</note> unleavened loaves out of new wheat and kept the Passover, the old
    eating of manna ceased, and on that same day came to an end. Thus in every single point the type
    set forth the truth, It is proper also for us to hear the actual words of divine Scripture: <pb
     n="223"/> "And the sons of Israel celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day from the
    evening, to the west of Jericho, beyond Jordan in the plain. And they ate of the produce of the
    land, and the next day they ate of the unleavened loaves of the Passover. And that same day the
    manna was taken away, after they had eaten of the wheat and the fruits of the land, and the sons
    of Israel had no longer manna"<note type="footnote" n="604" resp="#ebrooks">Josh. v,
     10-12.</note>. The fact again that he who was bom was circumcised on the eighth day shows
    clearly that that circumcision is a type of the life of impassibility in which we truly live,
    not the life that is spent by those who are bom to destruction; "for in the resurrection there
    is no marriage, nor yet persons given in marriage, but they are as the angels in heaven"<note
     type="footnote" n="605" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxii, 30. </note>: for the eighth day itself is
    the beginning also on which our Lord rose, when he became firstfruits for our resurrection. He
    who is circumcised on the eighth day, which is the beginning of the future world<note
     type="footnote" n="606" resp="#ebrooks">Cf. ep. 79, 80.</note>, is raised above this world, for
    the rest of which the seventh day was appointed, the end of which brings us to that day which is
    the beginning and the eighth, on which is the impassible life, and he does not know the words,
    "Be fruitful and multiply"<note type="footnote" n="607" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. i, 28.</note>.
    These, we think, are the <pb n="224"/> things which through circumcision were given to the sons
    of Israel. But you perhaps, conversant as you are in divine things, can think of something else
    that is greater and more sublime.</p>
   <p>And next the eighth question, how we ought to understand the saying of our Saviour in the
    gospel, "Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him"<note
     type="footnote" n="608" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. v, 25.</note>. The defence.</p>
   <p>It agrees with the order of your questions that we should also shortly refer to your other
    question about the words spoken by our Saviour in the gospel by way of persuasion and advice,
    "Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest thine adversary
    deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into
    prison, and thou shalt not come out thence till thou pay the last mite"<note type="footnote"
     n="609">Ibid., 25, 26.</note>. This commandment is almost the same which says, "He that will
    sue thee and take away thy tunic, let him have thy coat also"<note type="footnote" n="610"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ibid., 40.</note>. However this needs a great effort in order that we may
    restrain and cut away the corruptions of sin. For what he said is like this. "If you are
    standing in the <pb n="225"/> court that is trying the case itself, and are prosecuting before
    the judge, and are altogether wrapt up in the court, rouse yourself on the way, and change from
    enmity towards your adversary to agreement, considering the uncertainty of the issue, lest you
    have to submit to an adverse verdict, and the adversary on the contrary part deliver you to the
    judge as one that is guilty, and you fall some time under sentence, and the judge deliver you to
    the officer, and so you be chastised until you pay the last mite" (it is the custom to term the
    bronze coin that is the smallest a mite). Luke also clearly confirms this sense, and for perfect
    understanding it seems to me sufficient to cite his actual words: "But why dost thou not of
    thyself judge righteously? But, when thou art going with thine adversary on the way to the
    judge, make it thy business to be quit of him, lest he deliver thee to the judge, and the judge
    deliver thee to the exactor, and the exactor cast thee into prison. And verily, verily I say
    unto thee that thou shalt not come out thence till thou pay the last mite"<note type="footnote"

    has a suit with you about your tunic and with great power overcome the rapacity of him who is
    contending with you is an act of sublime and exalted wisdom. Think only of getting rid of the
    running to, the judge <pb n="226"/> and duly preventing it during the time that is pressing upon
    you, when<note type="footnote" n="612" resp="#ebrooks">We rather require 'before'. There is
     probably some error in this sentence.</note> you are not master of yourself, either to ruin
    your enemy or to reconcile him; and this needs the labour and toil of philosophy. For he
    commands us not only not to become adversaries, but to agree with our adversaries, and by
    watchfulness to keep guard over and restrain wrath, and quickly assuage the fire of enmity, and
    reconcile our present enemies by agreement. This is the simple conclusion of this in the form of
    exposition; for some have taken this saying in a higher sense. They say that a man's adversary
    is the reminder that comes from his conscience, and our Lord says this: "When you sin or wish to
     sin<note type="footnote" n="613" resp="#ebrooks"> (G) 'your neighbour offends against
     you'.</note>, agree with your adversary"; that is, accept the admonition that comes from your
    conscience, when it reminds you and blames you, if you have sinned or wished to sin; and, if you
    neglect the reminder from your conscience, and do not obey nor restrain yourself<note
     type="footnote" n="614" resp="#ebrooks">3: (V) 'be admonished'.</note>, you do not agree <pb
     n="227"/> with your adversary, but rather use force against your adversary. So also is it
    written in the prophet Hosea: "Ephraim used force against his adversary and forgot judgment,
    because he began to go after vanity"<note type="footnote" n="615" resp="#ebrooks">Hos. v,
     11.</note>. So also Paul wrote to the Romans and said: "Our conscience beareth witness, or
    maketh defence, on the day on which God shall judge the secrets of men"<note type="footnote"
     n="616" resp="#ebrooks">Rom. ii, 15, 16.</note>. The words, 'as long as thou art in the way
    with him', have this meanmg, 'as far as this world extends', and the way is trodden by all men:
    and this is what he said: "While you are walking in this world as on a way, <note
     type="footnote" n="617" resp="#ebrooks"> (G) om.</note> accept the reminder that comes from
    your conscience and do not refuse it. If you refuse it and pass out of this world without having
     agreed<note type="footnote" n="617" resp="#ebrooks">In another version (G) om.</note>, the
    conscience will take the place of an adversary and accuse you before the judge and place you
    under his sentence, and the judge will deliver you to the torture<note type="footnote" n="618"
     resp="#ebrooks"> (G) 'you will be delivered to unending judgments'.</note>; <pb n="228"/> and
    these things would not have befallen you if you had made union with your adversary in this way
    of the world, when admonition was offered to you, and you did not accept this in agreement. This
    John the Evangelist also wrote in an epistle and said: "If our conscience condemneth us not, we
    have confidence towards God"<note type="footnote" n="619" resp="#ebrooks">1 John iii,
    21.</note>.</p>
   <p>And next the ninth question, as to how we ought to understand the words used by Paul in the
    first epistle to the Corinthians, "Every sin that a man may sin is outside his body; but he who
    committeth fornication sinneth against his body"<note type="footnote" n="620" resp="#ebrooks"> 1
     Cor. vi, 18.</note>. The defence.</p>
   <p>Since you wished to have that other saying of the wise Paul also explained to you which is
    made in the first epistle to the Corinthians, "Every sin that a man may sin is outside his body,
    for he who committeth fornication sinneth against his own body", examine the explanatory and
    easy exposition of our holy fathers, who take this as a decree. Some say that Paul's <pb n="229"
    /> intention was this, to show the offence of fornication to be something greater than all other
    sins, and therefore he frightens those that are weak in order that they may rise to reformation,
    and by way of deterrent says that fornication is a sin of the body, and as if the other sins are
    outside the body, and, though a murderer defiles his hand with blood, and sins against his own
    body, and a slanderer immerses his tongue in calumny as in blood, yet he who commits
    fornication, he says, dips his whole body in the mire of sin, and lets it down as into a pot
    that is fall of putrid matter; therefore too he who commits fornication also, in that he thinks
    that the whole of him has been defiled and polluted, runs to the laver in order to wash off the
    stain itself of the pollution, which a slanderer or a robber or a thief never does, for they do
    not think that their body is polluted and defiled by the sin: for Paul, wishing to show that the
    offence of fornication is higher than the other sins, used this expression and said, "The other
    sins are outside the body; for he who commits fornication sins against his body". But certain
    others say that this is the meaning of the saying that he who commits fornication sins against
    his own body, that is, that he offends against the structure of the body, and, so to speak,
    against the very formation of man, <pb n="230"/> and the very mystery of the beginning of birth
    (for it is indeed an ineffable and all-glorious mystery and is known to God alone, how from the
    emission of a small seed this great and rational animal, that is to say man, takes a beginning);
    and this, they say, is the meaning of the words 'sins against his body': "and abstain, I pray
    you, so to speak, from doing despite to the formation of nature, from which your body too also
    sprang, by unlawful intercourse; for you forget that you are acting madly against yourself, for
    this act is in truth one of madness and drunkenness".</p>
   <p>This is what these say. But others say better, as I also judge their interpretation to be the
    highest, that is the nearest to the apostle's meaning. Paul desired, so to speak, to show that
    the sin of fornication is beyond forgiveness; and above this he says, "Know ye not that your
    bodies are members of Christ?", and he turns reprovingly and says, "Shall I <note
     type="footnote" n="621" resp="#ebrooks"> (G) 'Wilt thou'.</note> then take a member of Christ
    and make it a member of a harlot<note type="footnote" n="622" resp="#ebrooks"> (V) 'fornication.
     Far be it'. </note>?"<note type="footnote" n="623" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. vi, 15.</note>: and
    by this he <pb n="231"/> showed that he who commits fornication offends against the members of
    Christ; and so he goes on to say, "Every sin that a man may sin is outside the hody, but he who
    commits fornication sins against his own body". A slanderer or a thief or a robber or a covetous
    man sins against a man by slandering him or by stealing his property or by desiring his goods;
    but he who commits fornication sins against his own body, that is against a member of Christ.
    Every sin distresses God, and men are reckoned to have sinned against him. These however are
    human sins, and have been committed as it were against men. But blasphemy or idolatry, and
    contempt and neglect of the sacred service, and things like these, are, we say, acts of impiety
    against God, and they are believed, so to speak, to be without <pb n="232"/> forgiveness, as
    also Eli the priest and old in days who was negligent concerning his sons, who were evil men as
    it is written and unlawfully offended against the divine service; for<note type="footnote"
     n="624" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr.</note> he testified to them and said, "If a man sin against a
    man, they shall pray to the Lord for him: but, if he sin against the Lord, to whom shall they
    pray for him?"<note type="footnote" n="625" resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam. ii, 25.</note> So therefore
    Paul also wishes to make it appear that the sin of fornication is committed against Christ
    himself: and just as, if a man take a harlot and bring her into the holy temple of the Saviour
    of all, and there commit fornication, he will not merely be called to account for fornication,
    but also judged for impiety as having polluted the illustrious and holy place, so also he who
    commits fornication before believing: in Christ and writing him as his leader commits
    fornication <pb n="233"/> only; but, when he has through adoption been inserted in Christ's
    body, he is not only charged on account of fornication, but is also accused of impiety, as doing
    despite to the members of Christ<note type="footnote" n="626"> (V) 'taking a member of Christ
     and making it a member of fornication'. </note>. Therefore it is with this meaning that Paul
    says, "He who commits fornication sins against his own body". Immediately without any
    intervening words he went on to say, "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Spirit
    that is in you, which ye have from God? And ye are not your own, for ye were bought with a
    price. Praise God therefore in your body"<note type="footnote" n="627" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor.
     vi, 19,20.</note>. Accordingly it is plain that through the adoption of the Spirit, which is
    the Spirit of Christ, we both become a temple of God, and, as it is said, "Christ dwelleth in
    our hearts"<note type="footnote" n="628" resp="#ebrooks">Eph.iii, 17.</note>; and let no one say
    that he who slanders and he who robs pollutes the one the tongue, the other the hand only; for
    the pollution is not the same, nor are the stain and the mire the same; and, even if we allow it
    to be the same, yet the pollution does not affect the whole body equally, nor is the whole
    temple of God so to speak defiled. For he who commits fornication with a woman who commits
    fornication intertwines his whole body. <pb n="234"/> This objection the blessed Paul demolished
    beforehand by having recourse to the divine Scriptures and saying, "They two shall be one
     flesh"<note type="footnote" n="629" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. vi. 16.</note>. That the sin and
    pollution of the other sins and those of fornication are not the same, but that the sin that
    arises from fornication is far removed from these, because it renders the man who commits
    fornication with his body, or with the temple of God, suddenly void of divine grace, this is
    clearly signified by the story of Samson. He even before his conception received a commandment
    by the voice of an angel, his mother being barren and his father Manoah<note type="footnote"
     n="630" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr.</note>; and, when he had been conceived and grown up, his
    affairs were determined according to the commandment of the angel who appeared; for he said,
    "Thou shall observe and not drink either wine or strong drink, and thou shalt not eat aught that
    is defiled; for lo! thou shalt conceive and shalt bear a son, and iron shall not go up upon his
    head, because the boy is a Nazirite unto God from thy womb"<note type="footnote" n="631">Jud.
     xiii, 4, 5.</note>. And he grew up and became very great, and he was blessed by the Lord, and
    the Spirit of God was upon the boy, through whom he wrought marvellous and glorious deeds. But,
     <pb n="235"/> when he began to transgress the law of the Lord, the other sins were worthy of
    forgiveness, and the grace of the Spirit did not yet depart from him; but the sin of fornication
    rendered him bereft of the grace of the Spirit. First he transgressed against the law which
    commands the sons of Israel that it is not right to take in marriage women alien to their
    tribes, who<note type="footnote" n="632" resp="#ebrooks">Some words have perhaps fallen out. The
     pronoun in masc.</note> were the peoples round them whose land they inherited. For Samson said,
    "I have seen a beautiful woman in Timnath, of the daughters of the Philistines: now, take her
    for me to wife". And his father said to him, "Is there not a woman in the house of thy brethren
    of thy people to take, that thou goest to the uncircumcised Philistines to take thee a
     wife?"<note type="footnote" n="633" resp="#ebrooks">Jud. xiv, 2, 3.</note>: however, they did
    not persuade him, but on the contrary even went with him to make the unlawful betrothal. And God
    suffered this wickedness to be carried out, in order that he might requite the Philistines, even
    against the wish of the sons of Israel; for Samson's going down became an occasion for their
    destruction. But, as they were going along and were bent on making the betrothal, he turned a
    little out of the way, and he came upon a lion and killed him as a man might kill a little kid.
    And the divine Scripture states that the Spirit of the Lord worked mightily upon him', or
    according to the text <pb n="236"/> contained in other manuscripts, 'the Spirit of the Lord
    prospered his way'<note type="footnote" n="634" resp="#ebrooks">Jud. xiv, 6.</note>; and, though
    he opposed himself to God's laws, the grace of the Holy Spirit did not abandon him. However it
    was not fornication on which they were bent, but marriage. And again at the wedding-feast he
    composed a certain question, or rather<note type="footnote" n="635" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> a riddle, and asked it of those Philistines, fixing
    gifts for them and promising them so many garments and articles of clothing, if they told him
    the solution of that riddle; but, if they failed to find the origin of it and did not tell it,
    on the other hand he appointed a similar present for them to give. So much for what he did: but
    they could not find the interpretation of the question; but they persuade the woman who had been
    united to him to get the answer to the riddle from him by a trick, and make this known to them,
    as was in fact done. And thereupon those garments had to be exacted from him; for the holy
    Scripture said, "The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; and he went down to Ascalon, and
    there killed thirty men; and he took their spoils, and gave their garments to those who
    interpreted the riddle to him"<note type="footnote" n="636" resp="#ebrooks">Jud. XIV,
    19.</note>. Now mark here again also how it said that the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
    him, because he killed men alien to his race in fight, since God, as we have said, permitted
    this <pb n="237"/> same thing, that these men should perish, as men who had oppressed Israel:
    and at every great and wonderful and glorious deed that he did Scripture stated and said that
    the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him<note type="footnote" n="637" resp="#ebrooks">Jud.
     xv,14.</note>. And, after he had gone down to Gaza as is written<note type="footnote" n="638"
     resp="#ebrooks">Id., xvi, 1.</note>, and had there seen a harlot and gone in to her, he shone
    with the same brilliant deeds and was resplendent with the same good successes, and with great
    power advanced to such acts, God instigating him to these. Nevertheless after the fornication on
    the occasion of the successes gained by him the divine Scripture no longer stated that the
    spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; for the sin of fornication which is committed against
    the body, that is which is a sin against God, is of such a kind as to drive away the Holy
    Spirit. Wherefore also the wise Paul too says, "He who commits fornication sins against his own
    body", not as if the other sins were not objects of condemnation, for all of them contain a
    falling from the kingdom, but for the reason that was stated he was desirous to show that
    fornication is evil, and he wished to eradicate the passion itself from every man, as from some
    root; because the <pb n="238"/> Corinthians sinned wickedly in this respect; for he said, "Such
    fornication is reported among you, and fornication of such a kind that is not even named among
    the peoples, that a man should have his father's wife"<note type="footnote" n="639"
     resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. v, 1.</note>. He began with an accusation of this kind, founded upon the
    particular unlawful intercourse, and he went on to use the spiritual knife against all
    fornication; and he raised a charge of this kind to a height. Look at the strict mercifulness of
    God, as in the history of Samson. As soon as he had committed fornication, the grace of the
    sanctifying power of the Spirit departed from him, but it was nevertheless poured out upon him
    in the power and operation of the successes obtained by him, giving an opportunity for
    repentance by means of which every sin is overthrown and cast out, unless we throw ourselves
    into the pit of despair<note type="footnote" n="640" resp="#ebrooks">A Greek extract <foreign

   <p> For not only the manifestations of wrath that arise from wars, but also the chastisements of
    many kinds which are brought to pass from heaven for our correction it is the habit of Scripture
    to call evils. For the prophet <pb n="239"/> Amos said, "Is there evil in a city which the Lord
    hath not done?" And, explaining what an evil of this kind is, which is brought to pass by God in
    order to benefit, he said as his mouthpiece: " 'I smote you with heat and with jaundice, ye

   <p> First he says, "I am he who formed light", and then he added, "and made darkness;"<note
     type="footnote" n="643" resp="#ebrooks">Is. XLV, 7.</note> meaning this; that, because he
    formed light, he himself <pb n="240"/> made darkness. If light had not existed first, darkness
    would not have been brought into being, from the shield of the heavenly body. When light was
    formed, and heaven was stretched like a roof over the earth, the space between became of
     necessity<note type="footnote" n="644" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >ἀνάγκη</foreign>.</note> not light, and so darkness was accidentally brought into being, not
    having existed before; and for this reason the maker of all had need to say, in order to
    illuminate the darkness that was in the world, "Let there be light"<note type="footnote" n="645"
     >Gen. I, 3.</note>. All darkness is brought about by reason of shadowing bodies; because, if
    bodies did not exist in the way of the light, darkness would not result. The words are moreover
    spoken in order to do away with the falsely-named gods, and that we may know that he is the
    Creator of night and of day, and not, as the deceivers say, that the Creator of light is one and
    the creator of darkness again another. </p>
   <p>But the phrase "maketh peace and createth evil" makes its interpretation clear from the very
    understanding of the composition of the words: for he meant, 'Let everyone know that I am he who
    makes peace and creates evil'. What evil? That which stands in active opposition to peace, that
    is wars, and devastations of cities, which are justly brought upon us on account of our sins:
    just as, when the sons of Israel sat in peace <pb n="241"/> and plenty, and afterwards left the

   <p> For, after the fishermen had proclaimed the gospel and caught all the world, the word of
    truth took teachers of the church from profane wisdom, and seized them like vessels of

     meaning of <foreign xml:lang="syr">ܚܣܝܢܐ</foreign>, which is perh. corrupt. </note>, and,
    having given them to taste of the bowl of true wisdom, and satisfied them with the
    unintoxicating drinks of the Holy Spirit, it sent them out like fishermen and they caught those
    who were puffed up with the wisdom of the rulers of this world on all mountains, that is by
    means of the very thoughts of false <pb n="242"/> knowledge which are supposed to be high and
    elevated. This was proclaimed beforehand by Jeremiah the prophet when he said thus: "'Lo! I send
    out the many fishermen', saith the Lord, 'and they shall catch them; and after these things I
    will send out the many hunters, and they shall catch them on all mountains, and on all high
     places'"<note type="footnote" n="648" resp="#ebrooks">Jer. xvi, 16. </note>; though indeed,
    when a goodly spoil has been caught by the doctrines of divine wisdom, they reveal and expose
    their own defeat by means of another prophecy, crying to God their Saviour, "Behold us. We will
    be bondmen to thee, because tho.u art the Lord our God, and truly the high places and the power
    of the mountains were reduced to falsehood"<note type="footnote" n="649">Id., in, 22,

    shall consequently understand that the gates of bronze which are shattered and the bars<note

    iron that are broken<note type="footnote" n="651" resp="#ebrooks">Is. XLV, 2. </note> are the
    snares of argument and the precise questions stated in words from which there is no escape,
    which have many windings; questions which the truth has refuted and dissolved, being, stronger
    than everything, which heaven also blesses, as Ezra said<note type="footnote" n="652">1 (3)
     Esdr., iv, 35, 36.</note>; questions which Jeremiah calls 'holes of the rocks', on account of
    the secrecy and obscurity and the <pb n="243"/> ambushes hard to see which the same objections
    contain; for "they shall catch them", he says, "on all mountains, and on all high places and
    from the holes of the rocks". For the low mountains may be understood in another way also as
    those who are proud and arrogant in character, but are taught the gospel and made lowly, and are
    changed so that they cast themselves on their faces on the earth and converted to a humble
    demeanour by hearing the Teacher say, "Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
    shall find rest for your souls"<note type="footnote" n="653" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xi,
     29.</note>, and thereby another prophecy of Isaiah also is fulfilled in addition which says,
    "All mountains and all high places shall be brought low, and the crooked places shall be made
    straight, and those that have rough paths smooth, and all flesh shall see God's salvation"<note
     type="footnote" n="654" resp="#ebrooks">Is. XL, 4, 5.</note>. But, if we call the change of the

    I open to thee, that thou mayst know that I am the Lord thy God, who called thy name, the God of

   <p> While walking in the way of righteousness (I mean that of asceticism), and the monastic life,
    you meditate on the sublime thoughts of the God-inspired Scriptures, and gather benefit from
    them, and shun lack of knowledge and the poverty arising therefrom as something alien to the
    commandments of religion, and for this disposition therefore you are an object of praise. For
    the book of Proverbs also somewhere said, "The lips of the <pb n="246"/> righteous know high
    things, but fools die in scarcity". For this reason it has decreed for you a blessing from
    above, and a life that is without sorrow and blessed: for it adds, 'The blessing of the Lord
    upon the head of the righteous, this maketh rich, and sorrow in heart shall not be added unto
     it"<note type="footnote" n="665" resp="#ebrooks">Pr., x, 21, 22.</note>. It is therefore known
    beforehand that to me too you bring freedom from sorrow through your God-loving questions,
    inasmuch as you cause me to enjoy the pleasure of spiritual thoughts. Accordingly I will readily
    try to give an elucidation of the rest<note type="footnote" n="666" resp="#ebrooks">See p. 274,
     n. 2.</note> of your questions also. You are pleased to ask me what our Lord Jesus Christ
    wishes to make known to us by that parable which Luke the Evangelist recorded as follows: "Who
    among you shall have a friend, and he shall go unto him at midnight and say to him, 'My friend,
    lend me three loaves, for a friend hath come to me from a journey, and I have not wherewith to
    set before him', and he from within shall answer and say, 'Trouble me not. Lo! the door is shut,
    and my children with myself are in bed. I cannot rise and give to thee'? I say unto you that, if
    he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, because of his importunity he will
    rise and give him as much as he needeth". For<note type="footnote" n="667" resp="#ebrooks"> This

    of this parable from outside is foolish and senseless, <pb n="247"/> since our Saviour himself
    plainly added by his own words and declared that he brought this forward to convince us that we
    ought to pray and make requests without ceasing and at all times, readily<note type="footnote"

     type="footnote" n="670" resp="#ebrooks">Luke XI, 5-10.</note>. In what precedes he delivered to
    the disciples the form of that divine prayer which begins, "Our Father which art in heaven"<note
     type="footnote" n="671" resp="#ebrooks"> Ibid., 2.</note>; and so he added to it the parable
    given above, so that on all sides the object'is clear. But, since you have thought to yourself
    that there is some spiritual, sublime, lofty allegory<note type="footnote" n="672"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign>.</note> contained in the words of the parable, and ask what
    those three loaves are, we ourselves also find it quite impossible not to be uplifted with your
    instruction-loving and inquiring mind, and to state the partial result which we have reached;
    for assuredly we must not force the parables into an allegory<note type="footnote" n="673"

    Father and in the Son and the Holy Spirit; to which it is reasonable to suppose that our Lord,

    said, he ' wisheth all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth'<note
     type="footnote" n="675" resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim., ii, 4. What follows is in the Gr. put into

    taken no account of the faith, and at last towards the end of life come to a perception of their
    sins, and rush to the faith, the merciful one says this: "Even men of this kind, who come and
    knock at my door at an untimely hour of night, I will hear, not for the sake of justice, but
    because of their importunity<note type="footnote" n="676" resp="#ebrooks">Gr. ins. <foreign

    will hand to them the loaves of faith, which is the confession of the Holy Trinity". The friend
    therefore, the master of the house, is the God and Saviour Jesus<note type="footnote" n="677"
     resp="#ebrooks">Gr. ins. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ Χριστός</foreign>.</note>, who loves every
    man, even those who have not yet believed on him, and thirsts for their salvation. But he who
    asks for the three loaves in the middle of the night is he who comes to the faith late. But the
    friend who came from a journey and was received by him we should afterwards rightly understand
    as the angel or angels who come at the end of life to take us and <pb n="249"/> conduct us on
    the last journey; for they themselves also love us, and make our salvation a subject of
    rejoicing, according to the testimony of our Lord which says, "Joy ariseth before the angels of
    God over a sinner who repenteth"<note type="footnote" n="678" resp="#ebrooks">Luke xv,
     10.</note>. But the children who are resting in the bed are those who have been brought up as
    children, and have believed the gospel with a simple heart, and have been judged worthy to rest
    with our Lord. For the lying on the bed also is a sign of rest, as our Lord himself again says
    in the Gospel of Matthew: "Many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall recline
    with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven"<note type="footnote" n="679"

    have interpreted, because concerning this matter nothing is plainly stated by the God-inspired
    Scripture. But, since our Saviour's purpose requires that he should unite and comprise in the
    saying all the blood of righteous men that was unjustly shed, from Abel down to the day on which
    he himself said these things to the Jews, and lay the responsibility for this upon them and upon
    their ancestors, it<note type="footnote" n="682" resp="#ebrooks">This passage to 'them' (p. 252,

    that is born of her, the great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, like some King and chief and Lord
    over their people, and did not remove the holy Virgin herself after the incomprehensible
    conception by the Holy Spirit from the virgins' place in the temple, between the temple and the
    altar, as one that was married, but knew her to be still a virgin, and allowed her to stand in
    the same<note type="footnote" n="686" resp="#ebrooks">A. v, (AG) ins. 'time and'; Gr. om.
    </note> accustomed place as usual. For this reason (they say) those who heard of it fell into a
    rage and took weapons in their hands against him, fearing the king who was expected from his <pb
     n="252"/> prophecy, who was to exercise sway over them and lay the yoke of bondage upon them.
    And these things Gregory the wise in divine things, the brother of Basil the great, and bishop
    of Nyssa, in the sermon on the Nativity of our Saviour, states thus: "But, if we are not
    straying a long way from the subject, it would perhaps not be inopportune to adduce Zacharias
    also who was slain between the temple and the altar to testify to the undefiled mother. This
    Zacharias was a priest, but not a priest only, but possessing also the gift of prophecy, and the
    power of prophecy is proclaimed in the book of the gospel as inevitable<note type="footnote"
     n="687" resp="#ebrooks"> (E) 'unblamed'; Greg. (ed.) <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἀνάγραπτος</foreign>;(l. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκαῖος</foreign>? Luke, i, 67?).</note>,
    in that the divine grace makes a way for men beforehand, that they may not think the birth from
    a virgin incredible, and, training the assent of those who did not believe beforehand by small
    miracles, a child <pb n="253"/> is born to her that is barren and past age<note type="footnote"
     n="688" resp="#ebrooks">The grammar is confused in both versions and in the text of Greg.

     type="footnote" n="689" resp="#ebrooks">Greg. <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τὴν
      παρθενίαν</foreign>.</note>. For, as Elizabeth does not become a mother by the power of
    nature, inasmuch as she had grown old in the world<note type="footnote" n="690" resp="#ebrooks">
     (A) 'her life had grown old'. </note> without bearing, but the boy's birth is referred to the
    divine will, so also the incredibility of the virgin birth-throes obtains belief by reference to
    the deity. Since therefore the son born of the barren woman, who at the voice of her that had
    conceived the Lord, before he came forth to the light, leaped in his mother's womb, preceded the
    son born of the virgin, immediately on the forerunner of the Word coming forth to birth, then
    the silence of Zacharias is dissolved, by the prophetic indwelling, and all things that
    Zacharias utters were a prophecy of the future. This man therefore who was being led by the
    spirit of prophecy to the knowledge of hidden <pb n="254"/> things, having understood the
    mystery of virginity in the undefiled birth, did not exclude the unmarried mother in the temple
    from the place which according to the law was assigned to the virgins, teaching the Jews that
    the Maker of the things that are and Ring of all creation has human nature under his rule with
    all things, and by his own will leads it to that which pleases him, and is not himself
    controlled by this nature, so that it is in his power to make a new form of birth which will not
    cause her who has become a mother to cease from being a virgin. Therefore he did not exclude her
    in the temple from the ranks of the virgins; and this place was a space between the temple and
    the altar. Since therefore they heard that the King of creation was coming forth<note
     type="footnote" n="691" resp="#ebrooks">Greg. <foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >προελθεῖν</foreign>.</note> by dispensation to human birth, in fear of being under a king's
    rule they slew the man who testified these things <pb n="255"/> concerning the birth,
     sacrificing<note type="footnote" n="692" resp="#ebrooks">Greg, (ed.) ἱ<foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ερουργήσαντα</foreign> (l. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱερουργήσαντες</foreign>).</note> the
    priest at the very altar"<note type="footnote" n="693" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XLVI,
    1136.</note>. But of the Zacharias who was one of the twelve prophets we cannot reasonably
    understand the passage quoted, since it is not related that he was killed, but he departed from
    life by the ordinary end of human life. Wherefore also in the times of the pious king Theodosius
    the grandson of the elder Theodosius his holy body was found by revelation in the territory of
    Eleutheropolis, when it had not been in the least corrupted but was found as if it had been
    buried yesterday, at a place at which an oratory is now to be seen, and a temple which was
    consecrated to God in his name; and it is known and honoured by all who pass by that way. This
    is related by a certain Sozomen who wrote ecclesiastical histories<note type="footnote" n="694"
     resp="#ebrooks">ix, 17.</note>. Some have supposed that in the above-quoted passage our Saviour
    referred to Zacharias the son of Jehoiada who was put to death by Joash, king of the Jews. But
    this explanation is futile, and is refuted by the facts themselves. For it is not the case that
    the foul murder of prophets and priests, the murder which it is the intention of the <pb n="256"
    /> evangelic saying of our Saviour to set forth, was perpetrated down to his time and then
    ended: for after Joash other kings of the Jews also reigned who turned aside to idolatry, and,
    as is natural, were ill-disposed towards those who pleased God; among whom Manasseh is said to
    have put Isaiah the great among prophets to death with a saw. But besides these things we should
    know this also, that the man who was put do death by Joash was called Azarias and not Zacharias,
    though in certain copies some men have changed the name, and by a slight change have written
    'Azarias' as 'Zacharias'<note type="footnote" n="695" resp="#ebrooks">2 Chron. xxiv, 20.</note>.
    Accordingly for all these reasons it seems to be a just conclusion that we must consequently
    understand our Saviour's saying of the father of John the Baptist, as the holy Gregory said.</p>
   <p>Of the passage written by the wise Paul in the first epistle to the Corinthians, "He that
    speaketh with tongues edifieth himself, but he that prophesieth edifieth the church<note
     type="footnote" n="696" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xiv, 4.</note>", this is the elucidation. In the
    times in which the apostles were "propagating the saving preaching of the gospel in the <pb
     n="257"/> world, many of those who believed worked signs and prodigies, in order to bring
    unbelievers to accept the truth. For it is for this cause that miracles are numerous among
    unbelievers, and not among those who have already believed, according to the saying of the same
     Paul<note type="footnote" n="697" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xiv, 22.</note>. For this very same
    reason the gifts of the Spirit were given with greater liberality, and more openly, to these who
    were being brought to the faith. And those who were baptized often spoke with tongues
    immediately, and some were thought worthy to receive prophetic inspiration, while certain others
    even enjoyed the possession of both, as is written in the book of the Acts about some men who
    were baptized by Paul at Ephesus, as follows: "But, when they had heard it, <pb n="258"/> they
    were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And, when Paul had laid his hand upon them, the
    Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied"<note type="footnote"
     n="698" resp="#ebrooks">Acts XIX, 5, 6.</note>. This grace therefore flourished among the
    Corinthians also at that time, and some used to speak with tongues, while others were thought
    worthy to prophesy. And the form of prophecy was such that it was made known not only by
    foretelling the future but also by the commingling of words of instruction which corrected
    morals, as the God-clad doctors such as Athanasius the great and Basil, and such as Gregory and
    John, and all who were like these, gained renown at one time and another in the churches. Since
    therefore certain men at Corinth were puffed up and thought much of themselves because they
    spoke with <pb n="259"/> tongues, while others prophesied and taught things useful and
    beneficial, Paul, wishing to bring down their high looks, says this: "He who speaks with the
    tongues of the nations edifies himself, that is, establishes his own reputation, and is admired
    only, but does not benefit the soul of the hearers by reforming morals: but he who prophesies
    and weaves a web of moral teaching, and reproves secret things of the heart, and purifies the
    souls of the hearers from shameful passions, edifies the church, and acquires the gift of
    prophesy or of teaching for others rather<note type="footnote" n="699" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">μᾶλλον</foreign>.</note> than for himself".</p>
   <p>The meaning of Job's saying, "May the blessing of him that hath perished come upon me"<note
     type="footnote" n="700" resp="#ebrooks">Job, xxix, 13.</note> is plain to those who read with
    intelligence and not carelessly from the fact that it follows the words which precede, and from
     <pb n="260"/> the words which next follow. This is what he says: "Often have I seen a man
    suffering extreme tortures, and just on the point of perishing, as perhaps when enemies were
    upon him, or violent men, and have rescued him from distress<note type="footnote" n="701"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνάγκη</foreign>.</note> and saved him; and such a one
    has blessed me, because against all hope he had been delivered from the destruction that was
    impending over him<note type="footnote" n="702" resp="#ebrooks"> (E) 'hope had been found for
     him who was without hope, and through the same he had been saved'.</note>. May that blessing
    therefore come upon me, and may God bring it to effect"<note type="footnote" n="703"
     resp="#ebrooks">H ins. 'And this applies also to those who are sent and go down into the
     world'.</note>. That this is so the words which follow will prove as I said before. What in
    fact does he say? "For I delivered the poor from the hand of the powerful, and I helped the
    orphan who had no helper. May the blessing of him that hath perished come upon me; and the mouth
     <pb n="261"/> of the widow hath blessed me"<note type="footnote" n="704" resp="#ebrooks">Job,
     xxix, 12, 13.</note>. But one may also understand this in a higher sense as a parable. For our
    Lord also says in the gospels about those who mortify their soul to the world, and give up their
    body to the arena<note type="footnote" n="705" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >στάδιον</foreign>.</note> of martyrdom, or to labours of asceticism, and are thereby thought
    to be destroying and slaying their soul, because they are deprived of worldly pleasure: "He that
    destroyeth his soul for my sake shall find it"<note type="footnote" n="706" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Matth. x, 39; Luke, ix, 34.</note>. The prayer and blessing therefore of a man who has thus
    perished according to our Saviour's saying and finds his soul is a great thing: and any
    right-minded man will pray that this may come upon him, and will wisely say the words, "May the
    blessing of him that hath perished come upon me".</p>
   <p>As to what is written at the end of the book of Job, that he took an Arabian<note
     type="footnote" n="707" resp="#ebrooks"> (AH) '.'Arbakitha'; so below.</note> wife, it is
    unnecessary for us to inquire much who this is, <pb n="262"/> whether this is another wife by
    whom he had other children after the calamity, or the former one, who under the magnitude of the
    afflictions that came upon him gave way and stumbled, and advised him to utter some blasphemous
    speech and depart from his pains. However it is reasonable for us to understand that the wife by
    whom the children after the calamity were born was some other one different from her. For it is
    as if adding something new that the writer uses the words: "Having taken an Arabian wife he
    begets a son"<note type="footnote" n="708" resp="#ebrooks">Job, XLII, 17c.</note>. For it would
    have been far from just that she should share in the good things, who shrank in the time of the
    struggle, and tried to bring the combatant<note type="footnote" n="709"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἀθλητής</foreign>.</note> down from the highest summit of endurance. <pb n="263"/>
   </p>
   <p>The words that were written by the writer in the book, and these also about Job, of whom it is
    written that he also 'shall again rise with those whom the Lord raiseth'<note type="footnote"
     n="710">Job, XLII, 17a.</note>, we must suppose to have been composed with this meaning. In
    consequence of so great a trial he had in a sense gone down to Sheol and final destruction, so
    that even his name should thenceforth be extinguished, as he himself said when he was being
    tormented by the pains <note type="footnote" n="711" resp="#ebrooks">Id., xix, 14.</note>, and
    suddenly he arose as from the dead, and put off the unsightliness of the sores, and he was
    comely in body, as in the bloom of youth, and everything ended for him in a change to the best
    fortune. Therefore, lest any think that the prize of virtue ends with these things, and lest we
    who read imagine that we shall receive the rewards for the labours <pb n="264"/> of virtue in
    this world, for this reason the writer recorded the words that are written, "He shall again rise
    with those whom the Lord raiseth"; that is, lest any think that his rewards are completed and
    ended with present things: for these were given as an earnest for the things that are future and
    are expected by us all. For he shall rise with those whom the Lord raiseth, viz. those who have
    conducted themselves after the same pattern, of whom Paul also in writing to the Hebrews says
    that all those who have borne testimony through faith 'did not receive the promises, God having
    provided some better thing for us, that they might not be made perfect without us'<note
     type="footnote" n="712" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. XI, 39, 40.</note>. By the words which he used
    (and it is written, "He shall <pb n="265"/> again rise with those whom the Lord raiseth") the
    writer is thought to be explaining this also, that he endured such pains, not because he looked
    to the things that were given him in this.world, but to the hope of the great and wonderful
    resurrection, concerning which also he said, "I will endure for thee until I shall again
     be"<note type="footnote" n="713" resp="#ebrooks">Job, XIV, 14.</note>; and again, "For I know
    that he ever floweth who shall release me upon the earth. He shall raise my skin which endureth
    these things"<note type="footnote" n="714" resp="#ebrooks">Id., XIX, 25, 26.</note>. The words
    which are before us for the purpose of interpretation were used by the author with reference to
    the general resurrection which is expected by everyone (and the words are "He shall again rise
    with those whom the Lord raiseth"), and not, as your religiousness has supposed, to that by
    which some of the saints rose, <pb n="266"/> when our Lord took the saving Cross upon him for
    our sakes, and the Good Shepherd laid down his soul for the sheep. For this the holy<note
     type="footnote" n="715" resp="#ebrooks"> (A) 'Theologian'.</note> Matthew the Evangelist
    recorded in these words: "But Jesus, when he had cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost. And
    lo! the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom, and the earth quaked,
    and the rocks were rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who slept
    arose, and came out from the graves, and after his resurrection went into the holy city, and
    appeared to many"<note type="footnote" n="716" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxvii, 50-53.</note>.
    Since then the Evangelist stated indefinitely that many bodies of the saints who had fallen
    asleep rose, it is unnecessary for us to inquire who these were, and if Job was among them. For
    the reason why he said 'many', and not 'all the bodies of the saints' is because the
    resurrection which is expected by everyone is not that one, <pb n="267"/> but the one at the
    second coming of our Saviour Christ. For then, I mean at the time of the revered Gross, it was
    only in order to demonstrate the power of our same Saviour, who in that the soul separated from
    the body went down to Sheol, that certain men rose by a divine manifestation, showing that in
    the places beneath the earth there was perception of the God-befitting illumination. And these
    were prophets and some of those who lived after the same manner as they, who were well-known
    from the Holy Scriptures among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. This is stated also by the God-clad
    Ignatius, who adorned the throne of the Antiochenes, immediately after the apostolic
     administration<note type="footnote" n="717" resp="#ebrooks"> (A) 'coming'.</note>, and the
    first see of the chief of the apostles Peter, and was perfected with a crown of martyrdom. In
    writing-to those at <pb n="268"/> Magnesia he wrote as follows about our Saviour Christ: "How
    shall we be able to live without him? whom the prophets also, being his disciples in the spirit,
    expected as a teacher; and for this reason he whom they rightly awaited when he came raised them
    from the dead"<note type="footnote" n="718" resp="#ebrooks">Ad Magn., 9.</note>. But that we
    should think that those who rose then, at the time of the saving Cross, remained to this day the
    words of the gospel do not permit; for they cry plainly, "They went into the holy city and
    appeared to many". The word 'appeared' plainly denotes a temporary appearance, for the purpose
    of confirming, as we<note type="footnote" n="719"> (E)'they'.</note> said, the power of our
    Saviour, who broke the gates of bronze, and the bars of iron<note type="footnote" n="720"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ps. cvi, 16.</note> from which there is no escape, of the places <pb n="269"/>
    beneath the earth. After therefore those who rose had shown themselves at that time, they again
    laid their bodies aside and departed to their places, awaiting the general resurrection which is
    expected by everyone. That this is so, the holy John bishop of Constantinople also testifies in
    the fourteenth note of the second part of the commentary on the first epistle to the
    Corinthians, where he wrote thus: "But if any be in doubt why, when speaking about the
    resurrection, he did not here introduce the bodies which rose in our Lord's time, we will say
    this, that this is not speaking about the resurrection. For to show that those who rose die
    again was alien to the purpose of one who is showing that death is finally destroyed. For it is
    for this reason also that he said that it is the last thing to be destroyed, in order that you
    may no longer fear that it will rise. For, when evil is <pb n="270"/> done away, much more shall
    death be annihilated"<note type="footnote" n="721" resp="#ebrooks">In Ep. I ad Cor. Hom. XXXIX,
     30 (ed. Field).</note>. And in the fifteenth note which follows, when speaking about saving
    baptism, and explaining why a man who is about to be baptized, when he repeats<note
     type="footnote" n="722" resp="#ebrooks"> (E) 'learns'.</note> the baptismal confession, is
    baptized into the remission of sins and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal life, he says
    this: "For, since sin brought in death, the root being dried up, we must no longer dispute in
    any way about the: destruction of the fruit. Therefore after first saying 'the remission of
    sin', he then confesses<note type="footnote" n="723" resp="#ebrooks">Jo. Chrys. <foreign

    also the resurrection of the dead, being led from this to that also. And afterwards, since the
    name 'resurrection' does not suffice to set forth everything (for many after they had risen

   <p>We have now discharged, as you see, all the God-loving debt of your, esteemed questions,
    according to our feebleness, and according to the small measure of knowledge which has come to
    us; and we pray that there may fall to you the glorious part of Mary, who never tired of bending
    her instruction-loving ear to the saving teaching of Jesus, and upon whom that testimony was
    given which said, "For Mary hath chosen for herself the good part, which shall not be taken from
     her"<note type="footnote" n="726" resp="#ebrooks">Luke x, 42.</note>. But, whereas in the
    previous letter to us you stated how your religious brother Innocent and the sisters stand in
    the faith, and after writing this about them, as if you had done something contrary to the
    profession of philosophy, you then added that you take no "thought for them, know clearly that
    it is not a thing unworthy of your perfection that as regards the faith and in fitting spiritual
    matters you should take thought for those who are related to you, and perform all that is in
    your power, and give assistance with counsels and <pb n="272"/> prayers. For in these things our
    duty consists; and to this also the apostolic saying extends, "If any man taketh no thought for
    his own and especially those of the house, he denieth the faith, and is worse than an
     unbeliever"<note type="footnote" n="727" resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim. v, 8.</note>. And that we
    should take thought for their worldly opulence, or for anything else that is pleasant, is the
    part of those who are not philosophers. This distinction therefore I too made, and asked the
    love of God that is in you to write to me about them; and you have done well in telling
    everything both wisely and in accordance with truth; and it is proper that the distinction in
    this point also should not escape you. Upon another matter you have asked me questions of this
     kind.<note type="footnote" n="1" resp="#ebrooks"> </note> have heard that Isaiah<note

    and has trampled upon everything like a hog, with foul, disorderly, uncanonical feet; and that,

    and dissolved during the three days' burial, and certain similar blasphemies which are not
    plausible, which wound the ears, and disturb the souls, of those who listen without
    intelligence: and it <pb n="273"/> is therefore in my mind to send a man there carrying all that
    has been written by me, in order to establish the truth. If then you also have heard of any
    similar report that has been whispered there, since some persons have perhaps written and told
    you, tell me. The statement on which you have dilated in the letter, as to how you have loved
    and still love my humility with peculiar warmth, I read with great pleasure, and I rejoiced with
    spiritual joy on learning the fervour of the love that is in you, the God-befitting and pure
    love, wherewith rational souls are smitten towards one another, even among those with whom you
    associate in the blood of Christ. But I believe of you that, even if you write at very great
    length in every letter, you will not be able to express even a small portion of the love and
    confidence that you have towards me, who am unworthy and fall far short of this. But I pray that
    for this perfect love you may receive rewards both in this world, and in the future and endless
    life.</p>

   <p> But the words used in the 126th<note type="footnote" n="733" resp="#ebrooks">Ms.
     '120th'.</note> Psalm, which is the 8th of the Songs of Ascents, "As arrows in the hand of a
    mighty man, so are the sons of the shaken", should receive this interpretation. But the words
    contained in this statement apply also in a higher sense to each man's soul which by means of
    deeds of repentance is built up and renovated to form a holy temple of God. Those who returned
    from Babylon to this tangible and visible Jerusalem became sons of the shaken; who after
    captivity came to repentance, and by means of many trials were driven this way and that and
    shaken, and produced fruits of repentance, and thereby merited the return. But those who build
    up their own soul are in another sense sons of the shaken. <pb n="275"/> Divine Scripture calls
    the holy prophets and apostles, and all who conducted themselves like these, 'the shaken',
    because they shook out of their own soul like ashes all earthliness, whether thought or action,
    and all the likeness of the creature of dust and of the old man, and introduced into and
    impressed upon themselves instead of these the likeness of the heavenly one<note type="footnote"
     n="734" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xv, 47-49.</note> by means of a new life, as through the mouth
    of Isaiah our Lord is introduced saying to Jerusalem, and raising her obediently (?) from
    earthly deeds, "Shake the dust from thee and rise"<note type="footnote" n="735">Is. LII,
     2.</note>. And a garment that is shaken is not eaten by moth, and remains whole and uneaten. So
    therefore also those who by means of earnestness that is not eaten by evil things have been
    preserved for the adoption are understood to be and are called shaken. And again. Those who like
    smooth rocks that cannot be broken receive without changing the waves of this world and the
    assault of trials will therefore be understood and that very rightly to be shaken : and the sons
    of those who are shaken are the teachers of the church, who are held like arrows in the hand of
    a mighty man. For God the Lord of hosts is able to shoot those who through the same men learn
    religion, and to send into their <pb n="276"/> hearts the arrow of wisdom, the arrow of
    righteousness, the arrow of love in him, which comprises all the virtues; and through the same
    men also he shoots those too who oppose the word of truth, sending shafts of reproofs to effect
    a saving restoration if they will. To these sons of the shaken therefore, who are as arrows in
    the hand of a mighty man, he next gives a blessing, and says, "Blessed is the man who shall fill
    his desire from them"<note type="footnote" n="736" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. cxxvi, 5.</note>, for a
    blessing is given to the teacher who fills his desire by means of such arrows. But what else is
    the teacher's desire except the things that are for the profit of the souls of those that are
    saved? And this therefore should be understood not of a teacher only, but also of every
    Christian who lives virtuously, and through his own manner of life shoots everyone else as with
    arrows, and draws them to his own pattern. For those who so teach, or live, 'shall not be
    ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate'<note type="footnote" n="737"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ibid.</note>; and the gate is the exit from this world. For, even when they
    depart from the world, and take the last journey, and are about to go to the actual presence of
    their God himself, the demons the enemies of man's life are no longer able to encounter them;
    because, when they take <pb n="277"/> the last departure, those holy ones are not silent, but
    speak with the high voice of deeds, and in company with the rulers, I mean with the good and
    angelic hosts, who come to receive them, sing songs of victory and thanksgiving, according to
    what is said in the 67th Psalm, "Rulers went in front following singers, in the midst of damsels
    beating tambourines"<note type="footnote" n="738" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. LXVII, 26.</note>. And he
    applies the expression 'damsels beating tambourines' to the souls which show youthful prowess
    over evil passions, and like tambourines have deadened the bodies and fleshly desires.</p>

   <p> As to the words therefore which the Evangelist Matthew wrote that our Lord and God and
    Saviour Jesus Christ used: "Pray that your flight be not in the winter nor on the sabbath"<note
     type="footnote" n="739" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. XXIV, 20.</note>, know that they have a double
    meaning, and as a historical fact this has already happened to the Jews at the time <pb n="278"
    /> of the captivity at the hands of the Romans<note type="footnote" n="740" resp="#ebrooks">In
     another version (EK) om.</note>, but in a higher sense it is expected to take place at the end
    of the whole world. In fact after the outrage on the cross the judgment of God-slayers was
    exacted from them when the Romans took arms against them, and encamped over all Judaea and over
    the country round for whole years, and during the winter-seasons the evil consequences of war
    prevailed, and these especially in the winter when the fighting-men were idle; and not so only,
    but on the sabbath also they were slaughtered, because on account of the cessation of the
    sabbath they could not take arms in their hands and exact vengeance from those who were fighting
    with them. And this is often recorded by those who described the calamities of those men, that,
    by reason of the distress of the calamities which came upon them, they disregarded even the
    cessation of the sabbath, and took arms against their adversaries: nevertheless even so they
    fell with a complete and lamentable fall, and endured utter ruin. But, when our Saviour's words
    in respect of this prophecy are raised in meaning so as to refer to the time of the end and of
    Antichrist, it induces believers <pb n="279"/> always to persevere in works of virtue, and
    strive not to be caught by the winter or by the sabbath, at the time of the end, or the
    departure of every soul and its separation from the body, the winter signifying absence of
    fruit, and the sabbath cessation from virtue: for we know that the winter is unproductive as
    regards the production of fruit, and that the sabbath signifies cessation. For the winter, in
    which there is much rain and falls of snow, and gathering of clouds and a murky atmosphere<note
     type="footnote" n="741" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>, and
    scarceness of pure air<note type="footnote" n="741" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>, may denote confusion. The intention of the saying therefore is that
    our souls should be active and fruitful, and free from confusion as regards readiness and
    preparation for acts of religion, as in the words sung by David the prophet, "I was made ready
    and was not confounded"<note type="footnote" n="742" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. CXVIII, 60.</note>. In
    the same way should also be interpreted the saying, "Woe to them that are with child and to them
    that suckle in those days"<note type="footnote" n="743" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. XXIV, 19.</note>.
    For this also occurred as a historical fact throughout Judaea, when the hand of the Romans
    fought with them, so that the women who were with child and those who were <pb n="280"/>
    suckling were pitifully slain with their children themselves, either while they were yet in the
    womb or while they were being nourished at the breast. And in a higher sense on the last day the
    souls are to be reckoned as objects of pity which received in the mind the practice of virtue
    and bear it as in a womb, and began to hold the seed of the word of religion, which was with
    difficulty conceived in them, which bring forth to the light and as it were give birth, but
    produce the thing itself in very imperfect form, like women who are unable to give perfect
    nourishment to their babies. For those who cultivate virtue must according to the parable that
    is in the gospel bear the full measure so as to rise to the number of 100, or produce fruit of
    the measure of 60, or at least of 30; for what is less than this should like an
    incompletely-formed and unnourished babe be reckoned as nothing.</p>
   <p>But the saying "Where the corpse is, there will the eagles be gathered together"<note
     type="footnote" n="744" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxiv, 28.</note> is spoken as a kind of simile
    and proverb and illustration. As, when a dead body is found lying anywhere, both eagles and
    other birds of <pb n="281"/> prey come from different quarters from very lofty heights, suddenly
    and unexpectedly, in order to be fed, 'in the same way' (he says) 'shall be also the coming of
    the Son of man' <note type="footnote" n="745" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxiv, 27.</note>, for, when
    he shall again appear upon the earth, at the glorious second coming to judge the world, and
    shall appear with armed ranks of angels, all the saints also, rising 'suddenly and in the
    twinkling of an eye at the last trump'<note type="footnote" n="746" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xv,
     52.</note>, as the apostle said, shall suddenly all appear like some swift eagles of rapid
    motion. And very rightly were they compared to eagles, because they had high and heavenly
    thoughts, and lived in a manner worthy of the kingdom of heaven. But some have tried to
    interpret this saying in the following way, and have said that at the Lord's second coming all
    those who have lived a righteous life, and were like high and heavenly eagles in their mind,
    shall receive Paradise, and shall be gathered in the same place where Adam's fall<note
     type="footnote" n="747" resp="#ebrooks">Sc. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πτῶμα</foreign>, the word
     which is used for 'corpse'.</note> was, and the disobedience through which he fell into sin. Of
    the words, "Two men shall be at that time m the field, one is taken away and one left, two women
    shall be grinding <pb n="282"/> in the mill, one is taken away and one left"<note
     type="footnote" n="748" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxiv, 40, 41.</note> this is the explanation.
    The field is the world, according to what was said by our Saviour, "He that soweth the good seed
    is the Son of man; but the field is the world"<note type="footnote" n="749" resp="#ebrooks">Id.,
     xiii, 37, 38.</note>. Those therefore who have received the seed of the gospel, and the word of
    religion, while they are in the field and at work, either are taken into the kingdom because
    they are working and acting strenuously, or are left and remain as men who are indolent and
    slothful and lax. And the mill after the same model is this world, in which we pass our<note
     type="footnote" n="750" resp="#ebrooks">In another version (V) 'men pass their'.</note> time as
    at a mill, eating bread by labour and toil; and some strenuously undergo hardship and exertion
    in works of righteousness, while others spend their time in vain acts which pass away like a
    shadow. And on account of those things<note type="footnote" n="751" resp="#ebrooks"> (V) 'of
     these also'.</note> therefore it is <pb n="283"/> manifest that some are taken and others left.
    But the very wise Luke the Evangelist wrote this passage in the following form: "In this night
    there shall be two in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other left. There shall be two
    women grinding together; the one shall be taken away but the other left"<note type="footnote"
     n="752" resp="#ebrooks">Luke xvii, 34, 35.</note>. And these things are brought about
    beforehand by each act, of the rich that is and of the poor, some of whom because they have done
    deeds worthy of the kingdom of heaven shall be taken, while others who have been negligent shall
    be left. For indeed even those who are in bed, those that is to say who enjoy ease in this
    world, and are in the portion of the rich, who<note type="footnote" n="753" resp="#ebrooks">Sic
     Syr.</note>, if they administer the riches well, shall earn the privilege <pb n="284"/> of the
    kingdom of God, but those who spend this on vanities will justly be despised and put to
    contempt. But by the work of the mill those again are denoted who live in poverty and contempt,
    according to what is said in Exodus, "And all the firstborn shall die in the land of Egypt, from
    the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth on his throne down to the firstborn of the bondwoman who is
    in the mill-house"<note type="footnote" n="754">Ex. xi, 5.</note>; so that from this it is
    manifest that the name of [mill-house or<note type="footnote" n="755" resp="#ebrooks">These
     words must have been inserted by the translator in ref. to Pesh. <foreign xml:lang="syr"
       ><foreign xml:lang="syr">ܒܝܬ ܪܚܝܐ</foreign></foreign>. LXX <foreign xml:lang="grc">παρὰ τὸν
      μὐλον</foreign>.</note>] mill signifies the utter contempt and poverty of those who continue
    in such service for the sake of daily sustenance. Accordingly our Lord's saying in the gospel
    signifies that both from among the rich who enjoy ease upon beds, and from among the utterly
    poor who are occupied in contemptible employments on the last day some shall be found, of whom
     <pb n="285"/> some will be saved, while others will perish, and neither poverty nor riches
     are<note type="footnote" n="756" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr.</note> impediments to him who seeks
    to live in the fear of God, in order to earn the kingdom of heaven. But some have said that the
    words "Two women shall be grinding in the mill, one is taken and one is left" were meant by our
    Saviour to refer to those who teach in the church. For those men grind the word of teaching as
    in a mill for those who learn, and lay rational bread before them, suprasensually feeding the
    souls. Wherefore also they say that what is written in Deuteronomy, "Thou shalt hot take a
    millstone nor an upper millstone in pledge, because this man taketh a soul in pledge"<note
     type="footnote" n="757" resp="#ebrooks">Deut. xxiv, 6.</note>, was meant to refer to teaching,
    that a teacher must not lay them under any debt and bond of debt, since the souls of those who
    are <pb n="286"/> taught are taken in pledge, and made void<note type="footnote" n="758"
     resp="#ebrooks">In another version (E) 'and pass away from the teaching which takes the
      souls<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">......</supplied></damage>taught in pledge, and fails'. </note> in respect of the
    principles of religion and the hope that arises thence. And this holy Scripture signifies in
    Koheleth also, saying of the time of the end, "And the grinding-women ceased because they had
    became few"<note type="footnote" n="759" resp="#ebrooks">Eccl., xi, 3.</note>. Then accordingly
    all teaching shall be silent, and labour and toil, when those who have previously performed
    shall receive rewards: for neither is it time then for them to teach or perform. Therefore Paul
    in writing to the Galatians said: "Therefore then while we have time let us work that which is
     good"<note type="footnote" n="760">Gal. vi, 10.</note>. This then is what our Saviour said:
    "Then shall there be two women grinding" (and that means souls occupied in teaching), "one is
    taken and one is left": and he who has taught the things that belong to religion, and has set
    the sound word without detraction and accurately before the rational sheep is taken <pb n="287"
    /> into the kingdom, but he who has detracted from<note type="footnote" n="761" resp="#ebrooks">
     (V) ' debased'.</note> the teaching by heretical doctrines and deceived many, who by his own
    deceit has injured some, shall be left and sent outside the kingdom, having extreme judgments
    exacted from him on account of the wrong that he has done. Those again upon the roof they
    interpreted as those who have stood at the height of eminence.</p>

   <p> Your modesty's highness asked me some time ago why towards the end of the proverbs of Solomon
    we find this heading placed among them, as it were between two lines: "These are the
    indiscriminate admonitions or proverbs of Solomon, which the friends of Hezekiah king of Judah
    set down or arranged"<note type="footnote" n="775" resp="#ebrooks">Pr., xxv, 1.</note>; and it
    seems to me that the sentence bears some such meaning as this; that the proverbs contained in
    the book down to this heading are those which were discriminately arranged as one may say in one
    corpus and volume, that is which were set down in order and collected, Solomon having so
    arranged them; but many others also which were spoken by him as in short utterances were in a
    scattered way current. And the book of Kingdoms also states this, that Solomon spoke 3000
    proverbs or parables <note type="footnote" n="776" resp="#ebrooks">1 Kings iii, 32.</note>, from
    those therefore that were set down in a scattered way, confusedly <pb n="292"/> and
    indiscriminately, not as in a series and collection, Hezekiah's friends chose these, brought
    them into one order and collection, and added them to the book itself. You certainly do not
    forget that Hezekiah was a lover of God and an observer of the commandments of the law.
    Consequently therefore some learned Hebrews, wise in the divine words, took the trouble to
    dispose these indiscriminate and confused proverbs in some order, put them together as in one
    corpus, and presented them as a rational present to the king.</p>

    therefore during which we men live in this world, like a wheel, turns and revolves round itself
    in the space of seven days, but at the end it gives up the course and this circular movement;
    and thereafter rises a great much-beloved light, that of the last day, with which there is no
    night, but this day is one thing extending without end, and does not pass into another; the day
    on which the Lord the Judge will come, and 'will reward every man according to his works'<note

    well, and are prepared by zealous actions, he will reveal the good things which ' eye hath not

    of heaven itself. This last and renowned day without evening therefore is one reckoned by
    itself: but, if a man reckons it with the seven days of this world, he mentions it in the
    sequence of the eighth<note type="footnote" n="788" resp="#ebrooks">See p. 297.</note>; the day
    for which all who have believed in Christ are made ready by good actions, yearning to be

     'hours'. The double meaning cannot be preserved.</note> not only to those of the days, but also
    to those of the whole year: for the whole course of the year is divided into the spring season,
    the summer season, the autumn season, and the winter season; and the winter was in truth that of
    godlessness, which covered the whole world, in which there was all spiritual barrenness, and

   <p>And, to put it in another way, since 5000 years and more had passed since the world came into

    yet been completed as much as 600 or 700 or 1000 years<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"> Cf.

   <p> We say that according to the letter the law was abolished through Christ, but that in the
    spirit it was much more fully brought to confirmation. But what were the things of the letter?
    Sacrifices, sprinklings, various temporary cleansings repeated at stated times, and other
    similar things, which were different from heathen demon-worship, but prefigured the truth as in
    a shadow, as Paul also says: "For the law contained a shadow of the future good things, not the
    very image of the facts"<note type="footnote" n="810" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. x, 1.</note>. In the
     <pb n="303"/> same way Gregory the Theologian<note type="footnote" n="811" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">θεολόγος</foreign>.</note> also in the homily on the Holy Spirit
    wrote thus: "The first, when it cut away idols conceded sacrifices: the second, when it caused
    sacrifices to pass away, did not forbid circumcision. But afterwards, when they had once
    accepted the suppression, they conceded even what had been conceded, the one sacrifices, the
    other circumcision; and they became instead of Gentiles Jews, and instead of these Christians,
    having by a gradual change of position been brought near to the gospel. Let Paul persuade you of
    this, who from circumcising and being purified was brought to say: 'But as for me, my brethren,
    if I still preach circumcision, why do I continue to be persecuted?' The one is a matter of the
    dispensation, the other of perfection"<note type="footnote" n="812" resp="#ebrooks">Or. Theol.
     v, 25.</note>.</p>
   <p>That God permitted sacrifices in order to lead men to shun idolatry, Moses also testifies,
    since in Leviticus he wrote thus, after he had said that those of Israel were not allowed to
    perform any kind of sacrifice in another place besides the tent of witness: "And they shall no
    longer perform their own sacrifice to the vanities after whom they themselves go a whoring"
     <note type="footnote" n="813" resp="#ebrooks">Lev. XVII, 7.</note>. When therefore we say that

     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόθεσις</foreign>.</note>, test the matter. Various
    animals were formerly sacrificed for sin, and the blood of these was brought into the sanctuary
    by the high-priest, while, their bodies were delivered to be burnt outside the camp. This kind
    of sacrifices therefore symbolized beforehand the great sacrifice which balances the great sin
    of the world, as Paul also says: "For, as for the animals whose blood was brought into the
    sanctuary because of sins by the high-priest, the bodies of these were burnt outside the camp.
    Therefore Jesus also, in order to sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered outside the
     gate"<note type="footnote" n="816" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. xiii, 11, 12.</note>. Since then Christ
    the Saviour of all was sacrificed in the original model on the cross, and is also slaughtered so
    to speak every day on the altar, and is distributed to the believers limb by limb by the hand of
    the priests, who is so mad, and so exceedingly uninstructed in the greatest matters, as to dare

    rites performed at the old Passover, he also caused the hearer to pass from the letter to the

    eats this our Passover in truth to lean upon the staff of faith, using these words: "Stand

    things, writing in one place that he 'annulled the law of commandments in teachings'<note

    that of the same object he should say that it has been annulled and openly confess that it has

    justified in this and asserts that they have fallen from the grace that is in Christ. For it

    the swift foot of the word inasmuch as it has been abolished, rightly treating its bodily

    he had confessed him and said, "Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God", heard the plain
    words, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar Jona, for flesh and blood revealed it not to thee but my
    Father which is in heaven"<note type="footnote" n="846">Matth. xvi, 16, 17. In the Greek the

    'sons of thunder'<note type="footnote" n="847" resp="#ebrooks">Mark iii, 17.</note>. The reason
    for which they merited such an appellation was that he who proclaimed, "In the beginning was the
    Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"<note type="footnote" n="848"
     resp="#ebrooks">John I, 1.</note>, loudly thundered the divine utterance from heaven <pb
     n="312"/> and the gift of the Spirit that in truth came down thence, and stirred the attention
    of all nations by reason of the wonder, and tore up from its roots and as one might say from its

     ἑξῆς</foreign>.</note>. For it is manifest that James also was rich in the same grace as his
    brother, according to the unerring testimony of him who honoured them by one comman appellation.
    But some have said that the reason for which those three were peculiarly honoured beyond the
    rest of the disciples was that they specially loved Jesus, and in the same way he also too loved
    them, because of the virtues that were in them, as the very wise John bishop of Constantinople
    also said in the 56th homily of the Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, where he thus
    interpreted the words concerning them: "Why did he take these? Because these excelled the
    others. And Peter showed the superiority by the fact that he loved him much, and John by the
    fact that he was much loved, and James by the answer which he returned saying, 'We can drink the
    cup', and not by the answer only, but also by other actions, among them the fact that he carried
    out what he said. For he was so troublesome and burdensome to the Jews that Herod <pb n="313"/>
    thought this would be a great present to give to the Jews if he put him to death"<note
     type="footnote" n="850" resp="#ebrooks">In Matth. Hom. LVI, 1 (ed. Par. 2a, VII, 637). </note>.
    The words used by our Lord to his disciples, "Greet no man by the way"<note type="footnote"
     n="851" resp="#ebrooks">Luke x, 5.</note> naturally cause perplexity among those who read the
    divine Scriptures superficially: for greeting more especially becomes ministers of peace and
    teachers of a humble disposition. But it is not possible for us to take the actual injunction as
    bearing this meaning; for our Saviour is thereby shown to contradict himself and to be making
    use of injunctions which do not agree with one another; for Matthew wrote of him that he said to
    his disciples, "And, if ye greet your friends only, what special thing do ye? Do not the
    tax-gatherers also the same?"<note type="footnote" n="852" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. v, 47.</note>.
    How then can he who enjoins us to greet not only those who are friends but also enemies prohibit
    us from greeting those who meet us on the way? Accordingly therefore it is manifest that we must
    direct the purport of the injunction to another meaning. It is the habit of men to visit their
    acquaintances who live at a distance from them, and whom they have not seen for a long time,
    making this the occasion <pb n="314"/> of a journey, the greeting of those persons, as Luke
    wrote of Mary the God-bearer that the reason for which she went to the hill-country was to greet
    Elizabeth, saying thus: "And Mary arose in the same days, and went to the hill-country in haste,
    to a city of Judah, and entered the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elizabeth"<note
     type="footnote" n="853" resp="#ebrooks">Luke I, 39, 40.</note>. Since therefore our Lord and
    God wished his disciples to be unencumbered and self-reliant, and that they should be very
    zealous for the preaching-journey, he prohibited such greeting, when they were setting out on
    the apostolic and divine journey, lest they should give up the zeal for the journey set before
    them and enter upon the journey that is called vain, which leads aside to another path. For he
    wished the divine service of the gospel-message and of the saving preaching to be honoured
    before fitting human affection and the love that creeps upon the earth. And the approved Cyril
    also bishop of Alexandria wrote in agreement with these things in precise words and at length,
    in the 62nd homily of the Commentary on the Gospel of Luke: "Again how could it not be incumbent
    on men who were to enlighten those that were in darkness and to bring <pb n="315"/> them to the
    knowledge of the truth above all others to adopt a gentle demeanour and great affability, and
    not roughly shun intercourse with them, so as to refuse even to greet them? though it indeed
    becomes saints together with other good qualities to have that also of approaching people in a
    proper way and giving greeting. For perhaps it would happen that those who met them were not
    under all circumstances unbelievers, but also some of those who shared their opinions, or of
    those who had been already enlightened, so that for this reason it was necessary to give them a
    message of love, I mean the word ' Hail! '. What therefore? And for this reason Christ does not
    give the injunction in order that they may be misanthropes, nor does he give it in order to show
    honour to<note type="footnote" n="854" resp="#ebrooks">The translator seems to h ave
     misunderstood the Greek. The Syr. version of Cyr. has "What therefore does Christ teach by this
     also? He did not ordain that they should be rude, nor that they should honour".</note> a
    refusal to offer greeting, but rather he teaches them to avoid such refusal. It is not
    unreasonable for us to understand that, when the disciples were going round the cities and
    villages, and propounding the mysteries relating to the divine doctrines to those in every
    place, they did not then wish to do this without distraction, but so to speak at leisure,
    turning out of the way and making use of certain diversions, because someone perhaps wished to
    see a man whom he knew <pb n="316"/> and his friend, and afterwards spend the time proper for
    teaching in gluttony, not in urgent things. Accordingly he says that, showing unencumbered zeal
    for the divine proclamation, they should be sure not to give attention that does not profit to
    friendships (but rather that which pleases God is placed before every thing), and, while
    employing acts of courtesy that cannot be impugned and do not occupy attention, to give close
    attention to the apostolic business"<note type="footnote" n="855" resp="#ebrooks"> Comm. in Luc.

    and this narrative, when transferred to spiritual and suprasensual sublimity, suggests to us
    that before our Saviour's coming there was night in this world, for human affairs were devoid of
    the knowledge of God, being devoted to the service of gods falsely so-called; but, when a kind
    of rising and dawn of light took place, when our Saviour came and rose and shone upon those on
    earth, like a 'Sun of righteousness' (this the divine Scripture says<note type="footnote"
     n="858">Mal. IV. 2.</note>), then the apostolic net was let down, and made a great catch of
    men, and for this reason had the right side allotted to it. For Moses and the prophets, when
    they let down the fishing-net, during the past night, caught the people of Israel only, while
    these often jumped out of the net and served demons, and the present state is understood to be

   <p> But, since your saintliness asked with regard to Enoch and Elijah, of whom one was translated
    that he should not see death, as the apostle said<note type="footnote" n="872" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Heb. XI, 5.</note>, <pb n="321"/> while the other was caught up towards heaven, if they will
    undergo the common death, it is incumbent upon us to state, in proportion to the small capacity
    which we possess, the things that have reached our comprehension from the teaching of the
    fathers. It is believed therefore according to the testimonies of the divine words that Enoch
    was translated, and Elijah was caught up towards heaven, and was carried by the air<note
     type="footnote" n="873" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>, and that
    they are alive, and that they are in such places as God knows, and that he<note type="footnote"
     n="874" resp="#ebrooks">A. v. (M) 'Who'.</note> bestowed upon them such a marvellous
    translation hence, and that they are in a mortal body, having not yet received the blessing of
    immortality. For let us agree with Paul who says generally of all the holy men who pleased God,
    "And all these to whom testimony was borne through faith received not the promises, God having
    foreseen , some better thing for our sakes. that they might not be perfected without us"<note
     type="footnote" n="875" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. XI, 39, 40.</note>. And it is manifest that
    perfection <pb n="322"/> is nothing else except a state of immortality and glory, and
    impassibility, that does not grow old, in the kingdom of heaven. That this is so is confirmed by
    John also the wise in the Spirit, who became bishop of Constantinople, in the 22nd homily of the
    commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, where he gives the following teaching: "But many
    inquire whither Enoch was translated, and why he was translated, and why he did not die, neither
    he nor. Elijah, and, if they are still living, how they are living, and in what form. But it is
    superfluous for us to inquire into these things. For that the one was translated and the other
    was taken up the Scriptures stated; but where they exist or how they exist they did not go on to
    say; for they do not say anything beyond what is necessary"<note type="footnote" n="876"
     resp="#ebrooks">In Ep. ad Heb. Hom, xxii, 8 (ed. Field).</note>. And the same doctor delivered
    an expository discourse in Constantinople in the church of Marth Anastasia<note type="footnote"
     n="877" resp="#ebrooks"> In the Greek title it is called the church of S. Thomas, and the
     biblical citation and the mention of the martyrs are absent.</note> about the saying of the
    apostle who says, "Henceforth, my brethren, be strong in our Lord and in the power of his
     might"<note type="footnote" n="878" resp="#ebrooks">Eph. vi, 10.</note>, and, it being the day
    of the actual commemoration of the martyrs, and the king <pb n="323"/> having come to the
    martyrs' chapel and withdrawn before the sermon, he delivered a discourse after the king's
    departure, of which the beginning is: "Blessed is God for the greatness of the power of the
    martyrs, for yesterday they drew the whole city with the queen, and to-day the king with his
    soldiers, with great reverence". And, when in this discourse he was explaining about death and
    the resurrection, he gave this teaching: "Since therefore the fear had increased and had shaken
    the mind, see how thereafter he introduces also the hope concerning the resurrection, a dark
    hope indeed and not clear, but still he introduces it. For Enoch, who came into being after
    these things, he did not allow to die; and Paul says that 'by faith Enoch was translated that he
    might not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him'. For he translated him
    and did not allow him to die. He did not yet make him immortal, in order that he might not do
    away the fear, but he remains without dying. And he is not immortal; but he gave continuance of
    life in the mortal body, opening up, as I said, obscurely the hope of the resurrection"<note

   <p> You ask therefore what is the meaning of the divine command which is contained in the law
    that was given through Moses and says: "If thou make me an altar of stones, build them not hewn;
    for thou hast laid thy hand-tool upon it, and it is defiled"<note type="footnote" n="886"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ex. xx, 25.</note>. By 'hand-tool' he designates the instrument<note
     type="footnote" n="887" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄργανον</foreign>.</note> of
    iron, the ax or hatchet, that is wielded by the hewers. For he reckons an altar fashioned of
    hewn stones to be abominable and does not <pb n="327"/> accept it as being a defiled thing. But
    the symbol teaches that fruits that spring by nature itself from the earth are more pleasing to
    God, which shall be offered to God upon the altar rather than those that are gained by the
    rapine and violence of war, which are the acquisition of iron.</p>
   <p><supplied reason="ellipsis" resp="#compiler">(<emph rend="ital">And again.</emph>)</supplied> But the symbol
    of the law introduces to us also another thought which is akin to this and edifying. 'The altar
    that was built of chance stones naturally produced by the earth establishes the fact that God is
     pleased<note type="footnote" n="888" resp="#ebrooks">This is appy. the meaning of <foreign
      xml:lang="syr">ܗܢܝ ܠܐܠܗܐ</foreign>, though the construction is unknown to the lexicons.</note>
    by the simple impulses and natural thoughts that are in our soul, not by thoughts that are
    decked out by artificial preparation and manifold devices, and, as if hewn out, mingle with the
    truth and the simplicity arising from this. <supplied reason="ellipsis" resp="#compiler">(<emph
      rend="ital">And again from the same.</emph>)</supplied> For as the holy Cyril interprets in the 9th
    book about worship in spirit, "He names Emmanuel an earth-altar. For 'the Word became flesh'.
    For the nature of flesh is earth and <pb n="328"/> from earth"<note type="footnote" n="889"
     resp="#ebrooks">P. G., LXVIII,592.</note>. "But, if thou make me an altar of stones, build them
    not hewn". He does not allow words offered to God to be cut with iron. For Christ was 'the elect
    stone of the head of the corner and precious',<note type="footnote" n="890" resp="#ebrooks">Is.
     xxxiii, 16; I Pet., ii, 6.</note> incapable of being cut by sin, because he knew not how to be
    injured by the devil's strokes; and he was not divided between God and the world, though he
    became flesh, but he is all holy. Accordingly the altar made of earth, and the stones also that
    are not smitten by iron, signify Christ, as in the illustrations mentioned above. </p>

   <p> But the next point to which I will apply myself is the words found in the Book of Genesis
    that were spoken by God, when he was about to bring <pb n="329"/> the flood in the days of Noah,
    "My spirit shall not dwell among those men forever, because they are flesh; but their days shall
    be 120 years"<note type="footnote" n="891" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. VI, 3.</note>. You ask how it is
    that, when a space of 120 years had been granted, he is seen to have carried out the same threat
    after 100 years, and flooded the whole earth together. For Noah was 500 years old on the day on
    which he granted him the space; and the divine Scripture said, "And the waters of the flood came
    upon the earth in the 600th year of the life of Noah, in the 2nd month on the 27th day of the
     month"<note type="footnote" n="892" resp="#ebrooks">Id., vii.,11.</note>. Upon this, being
    directed to the truth by the divine Scripture itself, we say that the term of 120 years was
    given in mercifulness, in order that those who were living an evil life might change for the
    better in fear of the threat. But they came to the utmost limit of wickedness, and treated the
    divine long-suffering with contempt, and accordingly God brought the punishment immediately; not
    as if he did not know what was to happen, but to show by the long term the abundance of his own
    long-suffering, and to establish also the greatness of those men's wickedness, who so much
    increased their impiety, and went down to the very end and bottom of wickedness, so as to call
    the sentence quickly down upon them. <pb n="330"/> Therefore he further also said to the
    righteous Noah, "The end of all flesh hath come in before me, because the earth hath been filled
    with iniquity by them"<note type="footnote" n="893" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. vi, 13.</note>. For it
    is his custom to change his own sentences in the direction of fury and goodness according to our
    change, either towards wickedness or towards virtue. And this he stated plainly through Jeremiah
    the prophet: "If I speak a determination against a people or against a kingdom to root it out
    and destroy it, and that people turn from their evil deeds, I will repent concerning the evil
    things which I spake to do to them. And, if I speak a determination against a people and against
    a kingdom, that it be built and planted, and they do evil deeds before me, and hearken not to my
    voice, I will repent concerning the good things which I spake to do to them"<note
     type="footnote" n="894" resp="#ebrooks">Jer. xviii, 7-10.</note>. And that these things are so
    is laid down by the very wise John also who became bishop of Constantinople, when he is
    interpreting the 104th Psalm and writing thus, and contending as against the Jews, who adduced
    the promises to their fathers: "But, if the Jew argues against these things, and holds to the
    promise that was made to them, I learn that many such promises were indeed made in the Old
    Testament also. He promised to give the land <pb n="331"/> from the river of Egypt to the
    Euphrates, and did not give it. He promised Adam to lay the fear and dread of him upon the
    animals, and the promise was not brought to completion. He promised that the life of men should
    be 120 years, and he brought the punishment before the term. And in the opposite cases the same
    things are to be seen. He threatened Hezekiah with death, and turned it away. He threatened the
    Ninevites with overthrow, and dispelled the wrath, showing that neither good things nor painful
    things depend on him only, but also on the recipients. For, if he threaten something grievous,
    and those who receive the threat change, they repel the wrath from them. But, if he promise
    something good, and they show themselves to be unworthy, they will be deprived. Therefore he
    says, ' I will speak a determination against a people and against a kingdom, to build and to
    plant', but, 'if he says 'they are seen to be unworthy, I will not bring these things'. Let them
    not therefore bring God's promises before us, but let them show if they were seen to be worthy
    of these. But they cannot show it: therefore they passed to others. For we nowhere find that
    they are able to show that the words 'In thy seed shall all the nations be blessed'<note
     type="footnote" n="895" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. xxii, 18.</note> 'were fulfilled of them"<note
     type="footnote" n="896" resp="#ebrooks">The commentary on Ps. CIV is lost.</note>. It is the
    same difficulty and elucidation <pb n="332"/> to which the words' also relate which the holy
    Cyril wrote in the 12th book of the commentary on the Gospel of John, as follows: "But,
     because<note type="footnote" n="897" resp="#ebrooks"> Cyr. <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ὅτι</foreign>, which the translator has misunderstood. </note>, though he often promised to
    do many things at the fitting time, he nevertheless did them even before the time appointed, for
    the purpose of persuading us, in order that we may truly believe that even under all
    circumstances the things said by him will come to effect, we will show from the following. He
    promised to raise the dead, and to bring back to life those who are laid in the earth and dust.
    For, 'there cometh', he saith, 'an hour, wherein the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of man
    and come forth, they that have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but they that have
    done evil deeds to the resurrection of judgment'. And that he will easily make this good, and
    will hasten to persuade<note type="footnote" n="898" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr. <foreign
      xml:lang="grc">πληροφορεῖν ἐπειγόμενος</foreign>.</note> he taught by saying, ' I am the
    resurrection and the life'. And, because he would not make the greatness of the thing that the
    dead should rise at that time so to speak incredible, for a useful purpose the time of the
    resurrection is hastened<note type="footnote" n="899" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr. <foreign

    Lazarus and the widow's son, and Jairus' daughter. And what else besides these things? He says
    that the resurrection of the <pb n="333"/> saints shall be something exceedingly glorious.
    'Then', he says, 'the righteous shall shine in their Father's kingdom', that he may again be
    believed as one who speaks truly, in that he saw the disciples beforehand and gave the sight of
     this<note type="footnote" n="900" resp="#ebrooks">Cyr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρόωρον τοῖς
      μαθηταῖς κ. τὴν τούτου θέαν ἐχαρίζετο</foreign>.</note>. For 'he took Peter and James and
    John, and went up into a mountain, and was transfigured before them; and his face shone as
    lightning, and his raiment became white as snow'"<note type="footnote" n="901" resp="#ebrooks"
     >In Jo. Ev., ed. Pusey, III, 136.</note>. But in the above-mentioned commentary on the 104th
    Psalm we find the holy John bishop of Constantinople solving the point in Exodus that seemed
    doubtful; and the point that seemed doubtful is, you said, as follows: "How is it that, after
    Moses had turned all the water in Egypt into blood, Scripture said that the magicians were able
    to show the same sign against that? For, since all the water had been changed, how was it
    possible for pure water to be found in which these men were to show the sign?" Some have said
    that it was possible for sea-water to come, since the sea was not at a great distance, in order
    that they might change this by magic skill; while others have said that it is not incredible
    that Moses himself, after the change to blood, turned <pb n="334"/> the water back to its own
    appearance and nature, in order that the magicians might show their own skill on the other side.
    But the wise doctor John, since he understood the divine power as is right and in very
    discerning fashion, said that, as in the case of the darkness the Egyptians had that darkness,
    while the sons of Israel had light, and, as in the matter of the herds, and in the case of the
    yoke-animals when they died, those belonging to the Israelites remained unharmed, and, in the
    case of the plague of hail, where the sons of Israel were in the land of Goshen no hail fell, in
    the same way you should understand as regards all the plagues too, among which that change from
    water to blood was also included, and it must be believed that in the land of Goshen, and where
    the sons of Israel were, the water remained for the sons of Israel in its own nature without
    change, in which it was possible for the magicians to show the performances of their own skill.
    Among the words uttered by the doctor is contained the following passage by way of summary: "'
    He sent darkness and made it dark'<note type="footnote" n="902" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. CIV,
     28.</note>; and it was a very glorious fact that, while the ray shone everywhere, in, Egypt
    darkness appeared; and there not throughout, but only where the Egyptians were. For, lest any
    one should say that what happened was an eclipse<note type="footnote" n="903" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκλειψις</foreign>.</note>, <pb n="335"/> that is a disappearance of
    the moon, nor<note type="footnote" n="904" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr.</note> the course of nature,
    the Hebrews who were living in the same country with them were not affected by this plague, a
    thing which happened in the other plagues". After a similar manner Gregory also bishop of Nyssa,
    who was great in the knowledge of divine things, in the treatise which he composed about virtue
    said these things: he said: "For then all the nature of the waters in Egypt was in accordance
    with Moses' command turned to blood, and the fish were destroyed, because the water was
    converted to fleshlike density; but the Hebrews, when they drew the blood, had water<note
     type="footnote" n="905" resp="#ebrooks">Greg. <foreign xml:lang="grc">τοῖς Ἑβρ. ἀρυομένοις
      μόνοις ὕδωρ τὸ αἷμα ἦν</foreign>.</note>. Therefore there arose an occasion for the display of
    skill, that with the water found among the Hebrews they might in a defective manner contrive to
    produce the appearance of blood"<note type="footnote" n="906" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XLIV,
     308.</note>. The words used in the 1st Book of Kingdoms to Ahimelech the priest by the holy
    David, "Is the journey itself also profane?<note type="footnote" n="907" resp="#ebrooks">The
     ambiguity between affirmative and interrogative (see below) cannot be preserved.</note> because
    it will be hallowed to-day by means of my implements", if it is very carefully and clearly read,
    is seen to be much plainer than the sun, and to be free from all obscurity. David asked for
    bread to eat; and the priest answered and said, "There are no profane loaves under my hands; but
    there are holy <pb n="336"/> loaves. If the slaves have refrained, at least from a woman, they
    shall eat". And David answered and said, "But we have kept away from a woman since yesterday,
    and since the third day. Since I set out on the journey, all the slaves have been pure". And,
    these things having been so stated first, what follows should be read as a question, "Is the
    journey itself also profane?"<note type="footnote" n="908" resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam. xxi, 4,
     5.</note>; and thereupon the addition will give the reason for which the journey is not
    profane; and the addition runs, "Because it will be hallowed to-day by means of my implements",
    that is to say, 'Will anyone call the same journey a profane thing, a journey which has been
    hallowed by means of my implements?', viz 'by means of my armour, and the burden of my
    implements, and by my going to war'. And from this it is manifest that, inasmuch as the slaves
    were accustomed to carry his implements and arms, when he went out to war, they were purified.
    And, that slaves again used to march after generals or commanders, as armour-bearers, this is
    manifest from many instances; for the present from the end of the 1st Book <pb n="337"/> of
    Kingdoms, in which it is stated that Saul said to his weapon-carrier, "Draw thy sword and
    transfix me with it"<note type="footnote" n="909">Reg., xxxi, 4</note>. And towards the end of
    the 2nd book he says, in the numeration and reckoning of the generals or commanders of the
    divine David. "Naharai the Berothite, weapon-carrier of Joab the son of Zeruiah"<note
     type="footnote" n="910" resp="#ebrooks">2 Sam. xxiii, 37.</note>. This then is what David here
    said, "Even the slaves themselves are pure, because they are weaponbearers"; and this now when
    he had fled from Saul, and was not carrying arms. Wherefore also he asked the priest saying,
    "See if there be here under thine hand a spear or a sword, because I did not take my sword and
    my weapons in mine hand, because the king's word was pressing"<note type="footnote" n="911"
     resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam. xxi, 8.</note>. And from what is here stated especially it is manifest
    that those who went out for the purpose of being ranged in order of battle were purified. And
    this is very clearly recognised also from the commandments given in Deuteronomy; for he says:
    "If thou go out against thine enemies, keep thyself from every evil action. And, if there be
    among thee a man who is not pure from his discharge at night, he shall go outside the camp and
    shall not' come into the camp. And it shall be that towards evening he shall bathe his body in
    water, and, <pb n="338"/> when the sun hath set, he shall go into the camp. And thou shalt have
    a place outside the camp, and he shall go out there without. And thou shall have a peg on thy
    loins, and it shalt be that, when thou sittest outside, thou shalt dig with it, and shalt turn
    and hide thy shame with it; because the Lord thy God walketh in thy camp, to rescue thee, and to
    deliver thine enemies into thine hands; and thy camp shall be holy; and the shame of an act
    shall not be seen in thee and shall turn away from thee"<note type="footnote" n="912"

   <p>For you write to the effect that certain men said about the holy John the Evangelist that he
    did not undergo the common end, but still continues even now to exist without death, like Enoch,
    of whom the apostle said that he 'was translated that he might not see death'<note
     type="footnote" n="918" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. XI, 5.</note>, and Elijah of whom it is written
    that he 'was carried up in a whirlwind toward heaven'<note type="footnote" n="919"
     resp="#ebrooks">2 Kings II, 11.</note>. I am astonished at the crassness of the ignorance of
    those who said this and their lack of information. As the evangelist manifestly corrects the
    supposition of many and says, "Jesus did not say to him 'He shall not die', but 'If I will that
    he tarry till I come what is it to thee?"<note type="footnote" n="920" resp="#ebrooks">John XXI,
     23.</note>, where is there room for us to speak in opposition to the divine Scriptures and say
    that he who said these things remained immortal? The disciples above all, they who were the
    preachers of the resurrection, were bound to undergo the common <pb n="341"/> end, in order that
    all who received the preaching of the gospel might learn that all the chances of their
    blessedness rest in the future life, and that we must despise the life here, and willingly
    hasten to death. Such wonderful things were done in the times of the old covenant<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαθήκη</foreign>.</note>, when men
    were not yet in a perfect condition, and were deficient in faith, and were unable to receive the
    teaching of the resurrection, and firmly to believe that, after the separation of soul and body,
    it is possible for those who have once died to come back again to life. As to the fact that John
    the Evangelist underwent the common end, it is not we only who admit this, but men also who are
    highly distinguished among the fathers, and guides to the mysteries<note type="footnote"
     resp="#ebrooks">This phrase represents <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυσταγωγοί</foreign>.</note> and
    doctors of the holy church. And John, who became bishop of Constantinople, in the commentary on
    the Gospel of John, when commenting on the very place from which those who are blind towards
    what is manifest and plain draw the erroneous inference, says thus: "For, because Peter was
    always confident and forward in asking such questions, it was again by way of cutting away his
    impetuosity and teaching him not to make any further inquiry that he said this. Therefore the
    report went out among <pb n="342"/> the brethren that that man should not die. And he did not
    say, 'He shall tarry till I come', but, 'If I will that he tarry'. 'For do not suppose either',
    he says, 'that I manage your affairs in one way only'. But this he did because he wished to
    detach them from excessive love towards one another. For, since they were to receive the charge
    of the world, it was not right for them any longer to be bound up with one another: for, if this
    had been so, this would have been a great loss to the world. Therefore he says thus<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"> The translator therefore read <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >οὕτως</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτῳ</foreign>.</note>: 'You have had a work
    entrusted to you, look to it, and act and fight like a combatant. For what even though I will
    that he tarry here? look you to your own affairs, and concern yourself about them'. But do you
    observe, I pray, even here also the unassuming character of the evangelist. For after mentioning
    the belief of the disciples with regard to this matter he corrects it on the ground that they
    had not noticed what he said. For neither did Jesus say, 'He shall not die', but, 'If will that
    he tarry'<note type="footnote" n="921" resp="#ebrooks">In. Joh. Hom. LXXXVIII, 2 (ed. Par. 2a,

    this saying, writes thus: "When Peter therefore saw this man, he tried to be curious, and begged
    to learn to what and what kind of <pb n="343"/> dangers he also would after these things be
    exposed, or to what the end of his life also would come. But the question was manifestly beyond
    the limits of due reason, and that act was one of inquisitiveness rather; not of useful
    learning, that, having obtained knowledge about himself, he should inquire into the things that
    were coming upon others. For this reason, as I think, the Lord answered and said something,
    though not a direct answer to, the things asked or inquired about, but he turns in a way the
    purpose of the questioner to other things, so that he does not say 'John shall be immortal' but
    'If I will that he be alive till I come, what then is it to you yourself?': 'therefore', that
    is, 'you have heard, O Peter, the things that concern you, and why are you curious about things
    that concern others? and why do you probe into the knowledge of the divine judgments out of
    season? For, if he had actually said that he should never die<note type="footnote" n="922"

    wrote that John the theologian-apostle and evangelist underwent the common end of all men, and
    that he awaits the true and long life that has no ending which is after the resurrection: and in
    the 68th chapter<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >κεφάλαιον</foreign>.</note> of the book which we have mentioned he says; "It is related that
    John, the apostle and evangelist at the same time, was still living in the world, and on account
    of the testimony concerning God the Word<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Eus. <foreign
      xml:lang="grc">τὸν θεῖον Λόγον</foreign>.</note> was condemned to live in the island of
    Patmos"; and again in the 23rd chapter<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαιον</foreign>.</note> he writes thus: "In these times there had been left
    in the world in Asia the actual man whom Jesus loved, John the apostle and evangelist at the
    same time, and he was governing the churches there, having returned from the island in which he
    had been exiled after Domitian's death"; and in the 31st chapter<note type="footnote"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">κεφάλαιον</foreign>.</note> he immediately adds these
    things about him: "But the chronology of John's life we have already mentioned, but the locality
    of his body is shown from the letter of Polycrates (he was bishop of the region<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">χώρα</foreign> (Eus. <foreign
      xml:lang="grc">παροικίας</foreign>).</note> of Ephesus), in writing which to Victor bishop of
    the Romans <pb n="345"/> he mentions him and Philip the apostle at the same time and the
    latter's daughters as follows: 'In Asia also sleep great lights who shall rise at the last day
    of our Lord's coming, in which he comes with glory from heaven and shall search out all the
    saints, Philip who was of the 12 apostles, who also sleeps in Hierapolis, and his two daughters
    who had grown old in virginity; and his other daughter, who lived her life in the Holy Spirit,
    fell asleep in Ephesus. Moreover John also as well who fell upon our Lord's breast, who became a
    priest, having put on the crown, and martyr<note type="footnote" n="925" resp="#ebrooks">Or
     'witness'.</note> and doctor, he sleeps in Ephesus'. So much we have said concerning these
    persons' death"<note type="footnote" n="926">H. E., III, xviii, 1; xxiii, 1; xxxi, 2-4.</note>.
    But that other argument also besides is one of great madness and of uninstructed understanding,
    which confirms the erroneous supposition from the gospel saying which was spoken by our God and
    Saviour Jesus Christ to his disciples in this way: "Verily I say unto you; there are some
    standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom"<note
     type="footnote" n="927" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xvi, 28.</note>. It is time for those who thus
    err to say also of which of the other disciples they suppose that together with John himself
    they did not taste of death, but that they have remained immortal to this day; for the <pb
     n="346"/> saying is expressed in the plural, for Christ did not say 'someone who shall not
    taste death till he see the Son of man coming in his kingdom'. What answer will the men who
    speak all their words without examination give to this? It was not in reference to immortality
    in this world that our Saviour himself spoke these things to his own disciples, but because he
    wished to supply confirmation in the matter of the promise of the future life, and of the glory
    that is in it; for in fact a little before he said, "The Son of man shall come in the glory of
    his Father with his angels, and then shall he reward every man according to his works"<note
     type="footnote" n="928">Matth. xvi, 27.</note>. It was because he wished, as I have said, to
    raise their mind which still saw little and was confined to the lowliness of the dispensation
    and had no God-befitting thoughts to the height of that hope that he immediately added the
    saying, "Verily I say unto you that there are some standing here who shall not taste death till
    they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom", and because he was about to take the three
    disciples, Peter, James, and John, up into the mountain, and to show them a phantasm<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>.</note> and very
    obscure picture of the future kingdom and of his own glory, and as on a stage give to that which
    was immediately <pb n="347"/> duly to appear the future exalted and God-befitting greatness
    which our mind cannot grasp. For after these words in immediate sequence the evangelist added,
    "After six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up into a high
    mountain alone and was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his
    raiment became white like the light"<note type="footnote" n="929" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xvii.
     1, 2.</note>. Let no one again from the statement that the Son of man shall come in his kingdom
    refer the saying to the second coming of our Saviour; for the name 'coming' may be used not only
    to signify a bodily coming, but also for the glory and light of the divine revelation. This is
    shown by the divine saying of our Saviour when he says in the Gospel of John to his disciples,
    "If a man loveth me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come to
    him, and make an abode with him"<note type="footnote" n="930" resp="#ebrooks">John xiv,
     23.</note>. Here the expression 'we will come'manifestly denotes not a bodily coming, but a
    revelation as we have said of God-befitting glory and brightness. </p>

    shall every knee bow of those in heaven and of those on earth, and of those under the earth', he
    does not say this as assigning knees and bones to angels (away with the thought!), but he wishes
    to signify the intense worship through the form that it takes among us. So here also he uses the

   <p> But perhaps someone will say in question, "How are we to understand that the words which God
    spoke were uttered?" (meaning words such as those that were addressed to Adam, "Where art thou,
     Adam?"<note type="footnote" n="934" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. iii, 9.</note>, and those to Moses on
    the mountain at the giving of the law, and on the banks of Jordan, when Christ was baptized with
    the dispensatory baptism which saves us, and again when his appearance was changed on the
    mountain, when Peter and James and John were with him); for lo! we see that they are words of a
    saying that was uttered through the articulation, and it is written that they were heard by
    human ears, and it plainly cried by the Jordan and on the mountain, "This is my beloved Son in
    whom I am well pleased"<note type="footnote" n="935" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. iii, 7; xvii,
     5.</note>. We should therefore know, both in these cases and in all similar ones, that we ought
    not to fall from the supposition that befits God, and say that God emits <pb n="350"/> the sound
    of the composition of words made through the lips and with the tongue, but be assured, and that
    very wisely and confidently, that, by the divine operation and by the power that makes all
    things that exist, the filling word was brought into being. This the holy Cyril teaches and
    confirms in the work which he addressed to Theodosius: "For the Jews said that they knew that
    God spoke with Moses<note type="footnote" n="936" resp="#ebrooks">John ix, 29.</note>. For
    perhaps they did not know by reason of great stupidity that no one has ever heard the nature
    that is above all things speaking in a manner befitting men, but the words that are addressed to
    men are brought into being in a manner which he knows, for it is not possible for us to say. For
    what work will God fail from weakness to perform? For what will he not bring to pass if he
    wishes, and that very easily?"<note type="footnote" n="937" resp="#ebrooks">Not in either of the

     Severus, p. 75.</note>, who are under your authority by right of the metropolitan dignity,
    without a letter, the well-tried Basil arrived, bringing us a letter written by you, and, after
    gladly seeing this, we believed it to be a defence to the same charge, since we perceived that
    by means of it the reason for which the bishops came to the city of Antiochus is made clear. And
    the contents of the letter were concerned with other matters: for among these there was a query
    concerning a certain scriptural problem; and it seemed to me difficult and evidence of great
    ignorance for us to return an answer to the question while I am distressed in my soul on account
    of the division in the faith which has prevailed among you because of our sins. For we remember
    one of those wise in divine <pb n="352"/> things who says, "Instruments of music at a time of
    mourning are a tale out of season"<note type="footnote" n="941" resp="#ebrooks">Sir., xxii,
     6.</note>. However, since by the other letter<note type="footnote" n="942" resp="#ebrooks"> The
     Greek must have meant 'rest of the letter'.</note> we were released so to speak from the
    mourning of sorrow, I considered it right on account of the great honour maintained towards your
    excellence to write a few words in answer to that query, such as have come into my mind, and
    words which are drawn from the Scriptures composed by the Spirit and the fathers who with the
    help of the Spirit expounded these, little as we have understood. Since you have set. down in
    your letter (therein acting rightly) the points raised by every kind of understanding or by
    impulsive eloquence, I have determined not to extend this letter to a great length; for I myself
    also have believed that the enjoyment of the good things that are promised us in the kingdom of
    heaven is not sensual, nor yet does it consist in eating and drinking. Since the man who
    propounds the contrary argument is vehement, and everywhere introduces the restoration to the
    primitive state and the enjoyment in Paradise, I pass over the theory which raises the enjoyment
    and the trees and the ends of the branches to an allegory<note type="footnote" n="943"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign>.</note>, and come to a matter which is
    free from dispute, and simple, and one which draws its defence <pb n="353"/> from the truth
    only. That Christ by means of his Incarnation raised or raises us to these primitive conditions
    is certain. But this must be understood as far as concerns in corruption arid the abolition of
    death, to which the bitter taste enjoyed by disobedience gave birth. That Emmanuel invites us to
    prizes and crowns that surpass the primitive state, making our right actions means of support
    for further assistance, and that he does not raise us to Paradise again, but introduces us in a
    new fashion into the kingdom of heaven, is manifest and is never a matter of doubt, not even to
    those who are very perverse. And, in order that we may not be thought to be rousing the hearer
    to maintain the contrary argument by using our own inventions, we will as a superfluity cite the
    laws of the God-clad guides to the mysteries<note type="footnote" n="944" resp="#ebrooks">This
     phrase represents <foreign xml:lang="grc">μυσταγωγοί</foreign>.</note> of the church, which
    suffice to bring before our eyes the meaning of the divine words. Gregory the Theologian in the
    homily on the divine Epiphany in speaking about the Incarnation wrote thus: "This is more
    godlike than the former. This to those who have intelligence is higher"<note type="footnote"
     n="945" resp="#ebrooks">Or. xxxviii, 13.</note>. But, if there is more likeness to God, and it
    is higher than a new creation, it is manifest that it leads those who are formed anew to a
    higher and more divine <pb n="354"/> condition<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">κατάστασις</foreign>.</note>. And John the holy bishop of Constantinople in the
    homily entitled 'Why that tree was called the tree of good and evil', and 'What is the meaning
    of the words "To-day thou shalt be with me in Paradise"', laying down clear teaching on this
    matter, said these words: "The robber entered Paradise. And what is this? Are these the good
    things which God promises us? Do you not hear Paul saying, 'These good things eye hath not seen,
    and ear hath not heard, and they have not gone up into man's heart'. But Paradise both eye has
    seen, that of Adam, and ear has heard, and man's heart has received, for indeed we have been
    speaking about it for so many days. How then did that robber receive them? For God does not
    promise to bring us into Paradise, but into heaven itself; and he did not proclaim a kingdom of
    Paradise but a kingdom of heaven. For 'he began to proclaim and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom
    of heaven hath drawn near""<note type="footnote" n="946" resp="#ebrooks">In Gen. Hom. vii, 4, 5
     (ed. Par. 2a IV, 788). A similar passage is published in Greek from Sev. with no mention of Jo.
     Chrys. in Mai, Class. Auct., X, 444.</note>. Since these things therefore have been thus stated
    by the holy doctors, it is good to add Paul's words as a head and confirmation to what has been
    stated; for he <pb n="355"/> said, "The kingdom of heaven is not food and drink, but
    righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit"<note type="footnote" n="947"
     resp="#ebrooks">Rom. xiv, 17.</note>. For the saying, "Blessed are the lowly, for they shall
    inherit the earth"<note type="footnote" n="948" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. v, 5.</note>, must on no
    account lead us to the notion that after release from this world and the future life we shall
    enjoy sensual things. For even the holy John also whom I mentioned a short time ago stated how
    Christ, following the custom of the Old Testament<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">διαθήκη</foreign>.</note>, which promises a land of promise flowing with milk
    and honey, himself also similarly promised to the lowly after this model abundance of days in
    this world, and a share in the good things of the earth, writing thus in the commentary on the
    Gospel of Matthew: "For he does not incite from future good things only, but also from present
    ones, and that on account of the more dense among the hearers, who seek these things before
    those that are future"; and a little farther on: "And in another way also, because in the Old
    Testament the prophet says, 'For the lowly shall inherit the earth', he therefore weaves the
    sentence together out of words that had grown up with them, in order that they may not

    may not seem to be at fault, in that heaven was first set before us by God and afterwards a
    promise of earth"<note type="footnote" n="950" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XLIV, 1209.</note>. But,
    if any man, having regard to his belly and occupying himself with foods that please the throat,
    turn against these things also, saying, "Why therefore shall we make use of the earth?", then we
    must say to him; If we look for a new heaven and a new earth according to his promise, as the
    divine Scripture said<note type="footnote" n="951" resp="#ebrooks">Rev. XXI, 1.</note>, how is
    it anything but inconceivable that we should introduce the old custom into the renovation of the
    elements? When the earth is new, the life also as well: will assuredly be new, a life that on
    every point lies outside this one and differs from it; for we may hear the Psalmist saying, ,
    "The voice of praise and salvation is in the tent of the righteous"<note type="footnote" n="952"
     resp="#ebrooks">Ps. cxvii, 15.</note>. And this a man will say is the food of those who are
    about to live the expected life, continual songs of praise and the sublime contemplation<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</foreign>.</note> on which the
    angels also feed, and joy and inexplicable exaltation, in life that does not <pb n="357"/> end.
    For those whose throat gapes for sensual enjoyment, being involved in the same empty-mindedness
    as those men, make use of senseless fatuities and say, "For what purpose then shall we make use
    of teeth, or the other members by which the perception of the things that please is received?"
    To these it is obvious to answer that, since the soul receives the body in perfection at the
    time of the resurrection, those who rise not being devoid of genital members, and this though
    the book of the gospel cries, "In the resurrection they marry not, nor are given in marriage,
    but they are as the angels that are in heaven"<note type="footnote" n="953" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Matth. xxii, 30.</note>, after the same fashion they will have also <pb n="358"/> teeth and
    all the members of the body, that, as they have together with the soul practised habits of
    virtue, they may also partake of the glory; for it is not in order that they may make use of
    these according to the ancient custom. If we crave for and need sensual food in the future
    painless life, it is then time to desire also clothes made of wool, and the other things which
    this life shows to be necessary, in the summer and in the winter which comes round in the
    succession of the other seasons. But it is very certain that the expected life is free from all
    these things, since the seven days' circle which makes up the existing time ceases, and there is
    one day the eighth<note type="footnote" n="954" resp="#ebrooks">See ep. 79, 80.</note>, one
    which has none to succeed it and is without evening. If then there is a new heaven and a new
    earth and a new course of time expressed in one endless day and not divided into days and
    nights, how is it anything but reasonable to expect that the new life which is unknown to us and
    is not <pb n="359"/> even comprehended by the mind is severed from sensual foods, just as the
    life of the angels is far removed in comparison with the present life of men? But I for my part
    say this also, that, since Christ became a beginning for us in all things, it is manifest that
    the conditions of our resurrection also bear a resemblance to the same beginning. If then Christ
    after the Resurrection from the place of the dead is<note type="footnote" n="955"
     resp="#ebrooks">Mss. ins. 'not'.</note> made known in flesh as it is written<note
     type="footnote" n="956" resp="#ebrooks">Luke xxiv, 39.</note>, having, as he had, that body and
    no other, but no longer susceptible of hunger, or of any similar thing, nor yet one sustained by
    foods, it is assuredly necessary that our bodies also should not want anything; for Paul said,
    "As we were clad in the image of the earthy, so shall we also be clad m the image of him that is
    from heaven"<note type="footnote" n="957" resp="#ebrooks">1 Cor. xv, 49.</note>. For the fact
    that he ate and drank with the disciples as it is written<note type="footnote" n="958"
     resp="#ebrooks">Acts x, 41.</note> and received food should be ascribed to dispensation;
    because he did this same thing in order to confirm the nature of the body that had risen and
    cast out the supposition of phantasy. But, even though in conflict with the beginning of the
    argument, I say this also, guiding my opinions by the labour of the God-clad guides to the
     mysteries<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">This phrase represents <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >μυσταγωγοί</foreign>.</note>, <pb n="360"/> that, even if we expect the kingdom of heaven,
    and an end that is greater than the life of Paradise, we are not debarred from expecting a fresh
    return of the primitive state; for Basil the great said in the homily entitled ' God is not the
    cause of evils' that, if Adam had kept the commandment and not transgressed, suprasensual prizes
    and crowns and such as raise to an equality of honour with the angels were prepared for him; for
    he wrote as follows: "It was not fitting that he should have clothes either from nature or from
    craftsmanship, but there were others prepared for the man, if he displayed virtues, clothes such
    as by God's grace glistened and were to flash, shining garments, as those of the angels also
    are, surpassing the varied hues of the flowers, and excelling the light of the stars. For this
    reason therefore the garments were not immediately forthcoming, because they were prizes of
    virtue reserved for the man, to which by Satan's fraud he did not receive permission to
     attain"<note type="footnote" n="959" resp="#ebrooks">P. G., XXXI, 349.</note>. For us to adduce
    the food of the angels who were <pb n="361"/> entertained by Abraham is very much beside the
    point; for how can those who appeared as in a vision and a symbol be patterns for the things
    that are expected by us in reality? Shall we say that these three, who appeared to the,
    patriarch in the likeness of men, and signified the Holy Trinity (for the sacred Scripture said
    that God himself was manifested to Abraham<note type="footnote" n="960" resp="#ebrooks">Gen.
     xviii, 1.</note>), ate of that unleavened bread and partook of that calf in such a way that
    these things actually passed into the digestion and the material exits, and not rather that they
    were invisibly consumed in a manner which God understands, who brought about these things? But
    how is it anything but foolish and an act of great madness for us here to think of the
     phantasy<note type="footnote" n="961" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φαντασία</foreign>.</note> of Eutyches? Eutyches by comparing our Saviour's dispensation in
    the flesh, by means of which the word of God shared our nature, to earlier utterances and
    revelations of <pb n="362"/> God both to prophets and to patriarchs, which were described in
    symbols and adumbrations as being of God, missed the right principle. But we, who follow the
    apostolic teachings, who know that a vision shown in a symbol is one thing, and the truth of the
    fact another, pronounce that the coming of the Word in the flesh is quite distinct from the
    earlier manifestations which were made as in a dream and an adumbration. For we also hear of
    revelations coming from God which say to Aaron and Miriam, "If there shall be among you a
    prophet to the Lord, I will be made known to him in a vision and will speak to him in a
     dream"<note type="footnote" n="962" resp="#ebrooks">Num. XII, 6.</note>, and cry in Hosea the
    prophet, "I for my part multiplied visions, and by means of prophets was I likened"<note
     type="footnote" n="963" resp="#ebrooks">Hos. XII, 10.</note>. But he who multiplied visions and
    was variously likened by means of prophets became man for our sake truly and without variation,
    and in a new way. As therefore the shadowy and primitive symbols in no way impair by comparison
    the fact that our Lord and God Jesus Christ became in truth man invariably, so we do not on
    account of his true Incarnation refuse to hold the earlier symbols and obscure revelations given
    as in a dream and visions to be <pb n="363"/> adumbrations, since the Holy Scriptures cry this
    out with loud voice. Since then these things are so, we must shun the false opinion of those who
    think that the enjoyment promised in the kingdom of heaven consists in some sensual foods, an
    opinion into which Irenaeus bishop of Lyons in Gaul fell, who through the books of Papias
    departed from the truth, as Eusebius, who composed the Ecclesiastical<note type="footnote"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησιαστική</foreign>.</note> Histories for us,
     wrote<note type="footnote" n="964" resp="#ebrooks">H.E., III, XXXIX, 12, 13.</note>. Those who
    so hold, and expect a kind of recurrence of a cycle, are of a folly which even madmen do not
    possess; into which the witless Apollinaris also fell. This is as much as we are able to write
    on the present question, according to our small capacity. But it is the duty of your saintliness
    after the reading of these things to acquaint us by letter what was the frame of mind of those
    who disputed about this; for we shall think this a reward for our labours, to know clearly if
    after what has been written the supporters of the contrary opinion were helped. The other thing
    also do not forget, that, if after reading these things they retain any contrary opinion in
    their mind, we shall perhaps not be wanting in the needed medicines for this also. </p>

   <p> And the other thing also which you ask is a question of the Phantasiasts<note type="footnote"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασιασταί</foreign></note> who hold the opinions of
    the Manichees, since they think that they are propounding and saying something against which it
    is impossible to argue: "If our Lord underwent the circumcision required by the law, 'when', as
    the gospel says, 'eight days were accomplished for circumcising him, and his name was called
     Jesus'<note type="footnote" n="965" resp="#ebrooks">Luke II, 21.</note>, what happened to his
    foreskin?"; for those wretched men think that they are driving us into a corner, and do not
    understand that it would be an act of their own godless lack of intelligence <pb n="365"/> for
    us to refuse to acknowledge things that are written on account of things that are not written.
    It is not the gospel only which testifies through these words which have been cited that Christ
    was circumcised according to the law, but Paul also, who in writing to the Romans says, "For I
    say that Christ became a minister of circumcision on behalf of the truth of God, that he might
    confirm the promises made to the fathers"<note type="footnote" n="966" resp="#ebrooks">Rom. xv,
     8.</note>. For to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob our fathers both the covenant<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαθήκη</foreign>.</note> of
    circumcision was given, and the promise was made, "In thy seed shall all the families of the
    nations be blessed"<note type="footnote" n="967">Gen. xxii, 18; xxvi, 4; xxviii, 14.</note>; for
    Christ was their seed. Therefore also in writing the epistle to the Galatians he says, "But to
    Abraham were the promises made and to his seed; for he saith not 'and to seeds' as to many, but,
    as to one, 'and to thy seed', which is Christ"<note type="footnote" n="968">Gal. iii,
    16.</note>. In order to carry out the accomplishment of those promises therefore Christ came,
    and truly to endure <pb n="366"/> circumcision in the flesh, and to carry out the dispensation
    that consists in this; for the whole principle of the dispensation is dispensation and service;
    and so he caught all the nations by faith in him and made them Abraham's sons. Since therefore
    the God-inspired Scripture says that he was circumcised in reality, who is he who presumes to
    say that he did not undergo circumcision? a thing which those who teach the phantasy<note
     type="footnote" n="969" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">φαντασία</foreign>.</note> seek
    to deny along with the other things. Because nothing is written about the portion of himself
    that was cut off (I refer to the foreskin), we will not therefore refrain from confessing that
    he was circumcised in reality, he who said, "For so it becometh us to fulfil all justice"<note
     type="footnote" n="970" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. iii, 15.</note>, and was in everything made like
    unto us except sin<note type="footnote" n="971" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. ii, 17; IV, 15.</note>.
    Perhaps indeed some God-befitting miracle was performed with regard to the portion that was cut
    off, which Scripture left unknown to us; and for us to guess about unknown matters is a thing of
    great danger<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >κίνδυνος</foreign></note>. But what <pb n="367"/> is assuredly already known is this, that,
    when he rose from the dead, he took that also, inasmuch as it is a portion of the whole body,
    and he preserved it with this without corruption according to ineffable methods which he
    understands. For we also shall receive our own body complete at the resurrection, not carrying
    the diminution caused by sores or other injuries, but whole and perfect. It is a good thing to
    ask the impious men, who think that by such questions they frighten those who believe rightly,
    so as to reduce us not to acknowledge<note type="footnote" n="972" resp="#ebrooks">A.v. (K) 'and
     they will be caught not acknowledging'.</note> that our Lord suffered real sufferings in the
    body, what they themselves say about the blood which came out from the pure rib mixed with
    water. Did it reach the earth? For this also is <pb n="368"/> not declared by the holy Scripture
    of the gospel. But let them themselves be frightened by the fear of loss; and it is consistent
    for them to say that the blood was poured, out in semblance only, and did not flow in reality.
    But John, who became bishop of Constantinople and was a preacher of the true dispensation with
     boldness<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >παρρησία</foreign>.</note>, in the homily entitled 'Concerning the cross and concerning the
    robber, and concerning the fact that we should frequently pray for enemies' was not frightened
    by the fear of these impious men, but said that the blood dropped upon the earth and purified
    the whole of it, inasmuch as he wrote thus: "But why is he slaughtered at the height of the
    tree, and not under a roof? In order to purify the nature of the air, therefore it is done high
    up, without a roof above him, but heaven. For <pb n="369"/> the air was purified by the sheep
    being sacrificed high up. But the earth also was purified; for the blood dropped from the rib
    upon it"<note type="footnote" n="973" resp="#ebrooks">Ed. Par. 2a, II. 477.</note>. Accordingly
    therefore, if on this analogy the foreskin that was cut off touched the earth, it assuredly also
    sanctified it, and by methods which he himself understands who was voluntarily circumcised, he
    assuredly, as I said before, preserved it; and at the time of the Resurrection he rose with the
    whole body complete and without corruption, having this portion also undiminished, although he
    showed the scars of the nails and the lance; with which he will also appear to those who pierced
    him, according to the unerring words of the God-inspired Scripture<note type="footnote" n="974"

    shows this clearly in the teaching composed by him in the form of question and answer addressed
    to the brethren of the convents; and it is the 219th question, which is expressed as follows:

    says.</p>
   <p>Points which are matters of dispute and seen to be obscurely expressed m various places of the

    another dismisses some to 'the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels', and at

    also. When Gideon was ordered to attack a city by night, I mean the camp of the Midianites, the

    time of the Passion and of the voluntary saving Cross sought to clothe our Lord and God Jesus
    Christ, and indeed did actually clothe him, for the purpose of mockery contains no discrepancy,
    because Matthew related as follows: "And, when they had stripped him, they put on him a cloak of
     scarlet"<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. XXVII, 28.</note>, and Mark, "And they
    clothe him in purple robes"<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Mark XV, 17.</note>, and John,
    "And they covered him with a purple garment"<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">John XIX,
     2.</note>. You should understand that the rascally company of soldiers<note type="footnote"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατιῶται</foreign>.</note>, by way of prolonging the
    mockery and ridicule and derision for him, first clothed him with the cloak<note type="footnote"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">χλαμύς</foreign>.</note> of scarlet, that is red, and
    after this with the purple one, <pb n="386"/> thinking by the change of attire<note
     type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">σχῆμα</foreign>.</note> to increase the
    mockery. That they did this for the sake of mockery is plainly signified by the story told by
    Luke also, for he said that, when Pilate learned that Jesus was from Galilee, he sent him to
    Herod, on the ground that the supremacy and authority was by right his, and he was glad to see
    him; and when he did not hear any word from him, or see any sign done by him, but found him
    silent, 'having set him at naught' (he says) 'with his soldiers and made fun of him, having clad
    him in splendid robes, sent him to Pilate'<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Luke XXIII.
     11.</note>. But, if one considers the matter carefully and minutely, one may say that there is
    one cloak<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">χλαμύς</foreign>.</note>,
    of purple, but of purple which contains some inferior dark tincture, so that it disavows the
    true purple, and changes its appearance to one that is redder, and appears to hold a position
    approximating to both colours, and to be each of them, and in strictness is neither of them.'
    Accordingly the evangelists looked one at the one colour and the other at the other, so as to
    mention each of them both with the same meaning and in different terms. Since it was the purpose
    of those blasphemers against God to pile up the whole mass <pb n="387"/> of insult and increase
    the mockery, for this reason they found even the very dress which, as they thought, would excite
    much mockery; but the mystery contained in it which was hidden was shown by each of the colours,
    in order that the purple colour might show the King of kings and Lord and God, who was of his
    own will coming to the Passion, while the scarlet and red showed the fact that he himself took
    the whole of our sin, so that he was clad in the crimson cloak of blood, and nailed this to the
    saving Gross. For he suffered who knows not sin, not on his own behalf (may we never say this!),
    but rather on behalf of our sins. This therefore John also the ambassador said: "Behold! the
    Lamb of God who beareth the sin of the world"<note type="footnote" n="1044" resp="#ebrooks"
     >1044. 1. John, i, 29.</note>. And Peter the chief of the apostles wrote in his epistle: "He
    took up our own sins in his body on to the tree, in order that being separated from the sins we
    may live in righteousness"<note type="footnote" n="1045" resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. ii, 24.</note>.
    And the wise Paul wrote to the Corinthians about God and the Father, who wishes with him that he
    should suffer for for the sake of the salvation of the race of all men: "Him who knew not sin he
    made sin for our sake, that we in him may become righteousness unto God"<note type="footnote"
     n="1046" resp="#ebrooks">2 Cor. V, 21.</note>. </p>
   <pb n="388"/>
   <p>For there is also another further question which you ask, as to how we should understand the
    statement made by Gregory the Theologian in the 2nd peace-making homily about the Holy Trinity
    in the following words: "A perfect Trinity of three perfect ones, Unity having been moved on
    account of wealthiness, while duality was passed over on account of the material and the form of
    which bodies consist, and a Trinity was fixed on account of perfection, for it first passes the
    composition of a duality, in order that the Godhead may not remain narrow, nor be diffused into
    infinitude; for the one is mean, and the other disorderly, and the one is utterly Jewish, and
    the other heathen and polytheistic"<note type="footnote" n="1047" resp="#ebrooks">Or. xxiii,
     8.</note>. This abominable notion must therefore first be removed from our mind, that we should
     not<note type="footnote" n="1048">Sic all versions.</note> think that the Father first existed
    in his own sole hypostasis, and was moved as if by some <pb n="389"/> afterthought to put forth
    another hypostasis, that of the Son, and similarly further conceived the thought of putting
    forth a third hypostasis also from himself, that of the Spirit, in order that he might exist in
    a Trinity. On this theory it will result that the Son and the Holy Spirit are not ever-existing
    but were afterwards added to the Father, and we shall give occasion for the blasphemy of Arius
    who says, "There was once when the Son and the Holy Spirit were not". But this is abominable;
    for one who was acquired later and came into being afterwards is not God; for the Holy Trinity
    is of equal everlastingness, and it is therefore understood and acknowledged to be one God truly
    in three hypostases. The words used by the doctor we should therefore understand in the same way
    as that which is stated in Wisdom, "From the greatness and beauty of created things the causer
    of their birth <pb n="390"/> is inferentially seen"<note type="footnote" n="1049"
     resp="#ebrooks">Sap., XIII, 5.</note>; and from formed creation and this visible world we may
    conceive not only of the wisdom and power of him who created them, but also of the very
    peerlessless of his Godhead in regard of creation, and its distance in all points and lack of
    similarity. We see that all the bodies which make up the world are composed of material<note
     type="footnote" n="1050" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note> and
    form, and arise from a duality; but what material<note type="footnote" n="1050" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note> and form are we will state in the form of an
    example. For instance the potter's material<note type="footnote" n="1050" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note> for the craft is the clay, but he adds the form
    to the material<note type="footnote" n="1050" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >ὕλη</foreign>.</note>, that is to say, that which belongs to the fashioning of the vessel
    that is being manufactured, a jar or a pot or anything of the kind. But in this case the potter
    is the maker of the form only, and he borrows the material<note type="footnote" n="1050"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note>. But God, the Maker of all and
    perfect in craftsmanship, both brought the material<note type="footnote" n="1050"
     resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note> of every body from that which did
    not exist and added the form; and, if you speak of fire or of earth, or <pb n="391"/> of
     air<note type="footnote" n="1051" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀήρ</foreign>.</note>
    or of water, or of the sky and the sun and the moon and the other stars, he both formed the
     material<note type="footnote" n="1052"><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</foreign>.</note> of all of
    them out of non-existent things, and the form was devised for them in different ways at the
    moment that they came into being, and he is both the Maker and the adorner of the shapeless
     material<note type="footnote" n="1052" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >ὕλη</foreign>.</note> of the bodies, in that he differentiated it into the various forms of
    the bodies. And this Wisdom also states, when it declares concerning Pharaoh and the Egyptians,
    who were vexed by the serpent and the vile reptile: "For neither was thine almighty hand, which
    created the world out of shapeless material, at a loss to send against them either a multitude
    of wolves or fierce lions"<note type="footnote" n="1053" resp="#ebrooks">Sap., XI, 17.</note>.
    Therefore our mind, seeing that the bodies in this tangible world consist as we have said of
     material<note type="footnote" n="1052" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >ὕλη</foreign>.</note> and form, <pb n="392"/> and that they arise from a duality, and being
    instructed by the sacred Scriptures that there is one Godhead in a Trinity, wonders and is
    amazed at the profoundness of the theology<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">θεολογία</foreign>.</note>, since it sees a corresponding fact in creation, and
    is as it were initiated into a mystery and learns from creation the inaccessibility of the
    Trinity and its lack of likeness to and community with creation, and reflects in itself and
    says: The reason then<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >ἄρα</foreign>.</note> why the Godhead does not exist in one hypostasis is that it may not be
    inferior to the bodies, falling short in the restriction of number. And it does not again exist
    in a duality, because it shuns similarity to the bodies, which arise from a duality, but it only
    appears in a Trinity and as plural, which is admirable; for in the Trinity is completed the
    unique number which follows two. Therefore also, when Moses said to him, "Show me thyself, let
    me see thee plainly", he refused this, saying, "Thou wilt not be able to see my face, for a man
    shall not see my face and live"; but he added, "Thou shalt see my back parts, <pb n="393"/> but
    my face shall not be seen by thee"<note type="footnote" n="1054" resp="#ebrooks">Ex. XXXIII,
     18-23.</note>; signifying that by the very essence<note type="footnote" n="1055"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and by the sight, as one may say, of the face no man
    can comprehend God, but from his back parts a man shall know the things that pertain to him. out
    his back parts are created things which came into being afterwards, through which he is
    inferentially seen as the causer of their birth, as our father the Theologian himself also said
    in the 2nd theological homily: "These are God's back parts, all things which, being after him,
    make him known, like the shadows and reflexions of the. sun upon waters, which show the sun to
    weak eyes, because they cannot look at it, since by the purity of the light <pb n="394"/> it
    overcomes the perception"<note type="footnote" n="1056" resp="#ebrooks">Or. Theol. ii,
    3.</note>. And therefore in the passage now before us for interpretation he applied the
    expression 'movement of the Unity towards a duality' to the everlasting birth of the Son from
    the Father, and 'passing over of the duality' to the procession of the Holy Spirit which is
    timeless and thereby without beginning, and by means of the words used as we have said he gave a
     philosophical<note type="footnote" n="1057" resp="#ebrooks">The word <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >φιλοσοφῆσαι</foreign> is here included.</note> explanation in mysterious and divine fashion
    of the lack of community in the Trinity towards bodies which exist in a duality. The passage
    contained in the homily entitled 'of Lights' which says, "But where there is purification there
    is shining, and shining is the completion of love, to those who desire things that are great, or
    that which <pb n="395"/> is great, or beyond what is great"<note type="footnote" n="1058"
     resp="#ebrooks">Or. xxxix, 8.</note>, is plain and contains nothing difficult of comprehension.
    What he said is, "Where there is purification of the soul by means of virtues, there is the
    shining of knowledge, which raises and uplifts to the satisfaction of divine love". But the
    satisfaction of love is the end of things delightful and pleasing, which is God, who exists and
    is made known in things that are great, and in that which is. great, and beyond that which is
    great; in things that are great in the three hypostases which are equal in power and of which
    none is in anything inferior to the others in power and in equality in all things, except that
    they are distinct in the matter of non-generation and generation and procession, in the
    unconfused individualities which stamp each of the hypostases; in that which is great, <pb
     n="396"/> because he is one and the same and because of the Unity of the Godhead; and beyond
    that which is great, because he is not limited by size and quantity. For, in. that we employ the
    poverty of names that exists among us, we name God great, when he is more than great. Therefore
    also the Psalmist said: "Great is the Lord and very admirable; and there is no end to his
     greatness"<note type="footnote" n="1059" resp="#ebrooks">Ps. CXLIV, 3.</note>. For all
    greatness is limited, but the Godhead cannot be limited, and is not limited by any boundary.</p>

   <p> You say therefore that it has been discovered by certain persons concerning Balaam the
    soothsayer and seer and propitiator of falsely-named gods that it is testified by the divine
    words that he had such power in his mouth <pb n="400"/> that those whom he blessed were
    bles'sed, and those on the contrary whom he cursed were cursed. For this reason therefore the
    man who bore such a character was then lifted up to bless Israel also the holy people, the
    people which was named God's people; for you say that the same men who discovered this plainly
    produce these words. And at this I am not surprised; for it is the peculiarity of those who
    repeat the contents of divine Scripture cursorily and as it were from hearing, and not from
    learning and accurate knowledge, to arrive at false and erring notions. Where did the divine
    Scripture testify of the reprobate Balaam, as they said, that he had such a power? Moses who
    wrote these things, being inspired<note type="footnote" n="1060" resp="#ebrooks">Ms. om.</note>
    by the very excellent Spirit and being a minister of the truth, neither gave this testimony as
    in his own person, nor said of God that he gave any such testimony concerning Balaam, but
    recorded that Balak, King of the Moabites, being a demon-worshipper and a slave of foul fiends,
    thought of Balaam the soothsayer that he could curse and bless authoritatively and not in a
    worthless manner. And it is a simple thing to listen to the divine Scriptures manifestly
    proclaiming this: "And Balak son of Zippor, King of Moab, was at that time, and he sent <pb
     n="401"/> ambassadors to Balaam son of Beor the interpreter of dreams, who was on the
    river-land of the sons of his people, to call him. saying. 'Lo! a people hath come out of Egypt,
    and lo! they have covered the face of the land, and this people hath encamped round me. And now
    come, curse me this people, because this people is stronger than we, in case we may be able to
    overthrow some of them, and cast them out of the land; because I know that they whom thou
    blessest are blessed, and they whom thcu cursest are cursed'"<note type="footnote" n="1061"
     resp="#ebrooks">Num. xxii, 4-6.</note>. Since therefore Balak and the Moabites who were under
    subjection to him, and the Midianites their neighbours, who were barbarians, held this belief,
    God 'who wisheth that all men should live and come to the knowledge of the truth'<note
     type="footnote" n="1062" resp="#ebrooks">1 Tim. ii, 4. </note> according to the apostle's
    saying, instructing our race, hard as it is to turn, by many various methods, first showed his
    power with which none can contend, and displayed the kings round about them, Sihon, King of the
    Amorites, and Og, King of Bashan, who were giants, and trusted to their strength, and were eager
    to engage in battle, and met Israel in warlike guise, slain with the sword and dead together
    with their followers; and <pb n="402"/> afterwards, when the same Balak, prince, of the
    Moabites, as we have said, perceived the feebleness of his own power, and feared lest he also
    should become the prey of the Israelite sword, and had recourse to the power of the
    falsely-named gods, and thought that by means of the soothsayer's curse he was escaping from his
    troubles, the wisdom that is higher than all understanding instructed the barbarian by the
    instrumentality of the very soothsayer himself in whom he trusted that there is no other god
    beside him, and that by the very demons and the very soothsayers who serve them witness is borne
    that he alone is true God. For it is his habit to convert those who are in error to the truth by
    the very paths of the error. And this we do not say out of our imagination, but because we learn
    it from Scripture itself. It is recorded in the first book of Kingdoms that the Philistines who
    dwelt in Ascalon and Gaza and the neighbouring cities took arms against Israel and won a great
    victory over them in combat, insomuch that together with the rest of the spoil they took the ark
    of God also and placed it in the sanctuaries and shrines of the idols, and every city to which
    they carried it was smitten with the disease of emerods for which there was no cure, and the
    land produced a multitude of mice, and they [deliberated]<note type="footnote" n="1063"
     resp="#ebrooks">This is the sense required.</note> and took counsel <pb n="403"/> what they
    could do to escape from such distresses, and, having called upon the soothsayers, who were
    accustomed to instigate their actions by making use of the deceit of demons, they begged them to
    find a means of release from these calamities, and those men proposed to them the following
    plan; to bring cows that were first-born<note type="footnote" n="1064" resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam.
     VI, 7. <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρωτοτοκούσας</foreign>.</note> and were unaccustomed to the
    yoke, and to yoke these to a new cart bearing the ark and golden figures of the emerods and of
    the mice, equal in number to the cities that had been smitten with a plague of this kind, and
    upon this to shut up the calves that had been born in one house, that, if their mothers went on
    drawing the cart to the land of Judah, where the ark was previously placed, they might know that
    the God of Israel had laid the plagues upon them as a punishment, but, if hey turned towards the
    cry of the calves and were affected in accordance with their own natural instincts, they might
    learn that it was not on account of Israel that the punishment came upon them, but they happened
    as men to suffer these things. And, when these things had been thus stated, those cows as if
    very forcibly driven by the command of God, went of their own <pb n="404"/> accord to the land
    of Judah and brought the ark with the propitiatory offerings, though it was not those words of
    the soothsayers that were able to do these things, but God himself acted according to their
    words, and by means of the soothsaying to which they were accustomed and which they loved led
    the Philistines who were in error to the knowledge of the truth. So too Nebuchadnezzar also had
    future things revealed to him beforehand by an ordinary vision seen in dreams, in order that by
    Daniel's wise interpretation concerning the things seen in the dream the Babylonians might know
    what the God of the Hebrews was; and Nebuchadnezzar must not on this account be placed among
    religious men, as neither must the soothsayers who advised the Philistines to adopt the
    above-mentioned plan; for even they themselves also could if they wished on the strength of such
    signs have recognised God and not remained in error. For neither did God bring such things about
    for any other purpose, condescending as he did at times to men who were not in the perfect
    state, except that every man might be saved, because he is indeed the Creator of all. The
    prophesyings and workings of miracles are not under all circumstances performed by men who are
    worthy, but perhaps by men who are unworthy also for their own profit, because they are <pb
     n="405"/> barbarians, and cannot be brought to religion by teaching or by any other similar
    method. This same thing our Lord and God Jesus Christ also said in the gospel: "Many shall say
    in that day, 'Our Lord,] our Lord, did we not in [thy] name prophesy, and in [thy] name cast out
    demons, and in thy name do many mighty works?' and then will I profess unto them, ' I never knew
    you, depart ye from me, workers of iniquity'"<note type="footnote" n="1065" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Matth. vii, 22, 23.</note>. And Caiphas, being president and ruler of the assembly of the Jews
    that contended with God, those who crucified our Lord, said prophetically that he should be
    crucified for the people; and this John the Evangelist who was indeed the Theologian described
    as follows: "But one of them, Caiaphas, who was the high-priest of that year, said to them, 'Ye
    know nothing, and do not consider that it is expedient for us that one man die for the people,
    and the whole people perish not'. But this he said not of himself, but, because he was the
    high-priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the people, and not for the
    people only, but also that he might gather into one the sons of God who were scattered"<note
     type="footnote" n="1066" resp="#ebrooks">John XI, 49-52.</note>. Accordingly therefore neither

    The citations which we have made from the testimonies of the divine Scriptures are in themselves
    sufficient; but I will show by means of a few instances that the genuine doctors of the church
    also have taught us to think and say these things. The very wise John who became bishop of
    Constantinople in the 6th homily of the commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, when he was
    speaking about the Magi who by seeing the star were led to know our Lord and God Jesus, who was
    in swaddling-clothes and was being nurtured on milk from his mother's breast in the flesh,
    teaches as follows: "And wherefore did he attract them by such a sight? But how should he have
    done so? Should he have sent prophets? but the Magi would not have submitted to the prophets.
    But should he have emitted a voice from on high? but they would not have regarded this. But
    should he have sent an angel? but him also they would accordingly have <pb n="407"/> neglected.
    But on this account God, having set all these methods aside, calls them by means of things to
    which they are accustomed, condescending greatly, and showing them a great and peculiar star, in
    order by means of the size and the beauty of the appearance to make them astonished, and by the
    method of movement. Imitating these things, Paul spoke to the heathen from the starting-point of
    an altar, and cites testimonies from the poets, and he spoke with the Jews from the
    starting-point of circumcision, and with those who lived according to the law he took the
    beginning of teaching from sacrifices. For, since each man loves that to which he is accustomed,
    both God and also the men who were sent by him for the salvation of the world used facts in this
    way. Do not therefore think it an unworthy thing that he called them by means of a star; since,
    if it is so, you will find fault with all the practices of the Jews also, their sacrifices and
    their cleansings, and the beginnings of the months and the ark and the temple itself. For these
    things also received their origin from heathen denseness. But nevertheless God for the sake of
    the salvation of those who had gone astray consented to be worshipped by means of the very
    things by which the demons outside were worshipped, changing them himself a little, in order
    [that] he might <pb n="408"/> remove them gradually from the custom [and] bring them to the high
    philosophy; a thing which he also does to the Magi, in that he consented to call them by means
    of the appearance of the star, in order to make them thereafter higher. Since therefore he
    brought and led them, and set them by the manger, he did not again thereafter speak with them
    through a star, but through an angel, and so they gradually became better. The same thing he did
    also to the men of Ascalon and Gaza. For these five cities also, since after the coming of the
    ark they had been smitten with a regular plague, and found no escape from the plagues laid upon
    them, having called the soothsayers and held an assembly, wished to find a release from the
    plague which came from God. But the soothsayers said that they should yoke unbroken and
     firstborn<note type="footnote" n="1068" resp="#ebrooks">Jo. Chrys. <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >πρωτοτοκούσας</foreign>. </note> cows to the ark and let them go, no man leading them; 'for
    so it will be plain whether the plague is from God, or from some chance or disease. For, if'
    (they say) 'they either from inexperience break the yoke, or return to the calves when they low,
    it is a chance or an accident that has happened. But, if they walk straight, and are in no way
    affected by the lowing of their young, or by the ignorance of their error<note type="footnote"
     n="1069" resp="#ebrooks">The translator seems to have read <foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >πλάνης</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">πλανηθῶσι</foreign>.</note>
    <pb n="409"/> in the way, it is very plain that it is God's hand that has touched these cities'.
    Since therefore, after the soothsayers had said these things, those who dwelt in these cities
    obeyed, and did as they commanded, God also followed the counsel of the soothsayers, again
    condescending, and it did not seem to him to be a thing unworthy of him to carry into effect the
    thing stated beforehand by the soothsayers, and make them appear to be truthful men in what they
    spoke at that time. For indeed the success obtained was a great thing, that the adversaries
    themselves should bear witness to the power of God, and their own teachers themselves should
    pronounce a decision concerning him. And many other such things one may see that God performs by
     dispensation"<note type="footnote" n="1070" resp="#ebrooks">In Matth. Hom. vi, 3 (ed. Par. 2a,
     VII, 105).</note>. And in the 24th homily of the same work, where he is expounding the passage
    which we ourselves mentioned above, which says, "Many shall say to me on that day, 'Our Lord,
    our Lord, did we not in thy name prophesy, and in thy name cast out demons, and in thy name do
    many mighty works?' And then he will profess unto them, 'I never knew you. Depart ye from me, ye
    who work iniquity'", he gave the same teaching in the following form: "Who therefore are these?"
    (he says). <pb n="410"/> "Many of those who believed received gifts, as was<note type="footnote"
     n="1071" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr. and Jo. Chrys.</note> the man who was casting out demons and
    was not with him; as was<note type="footnote" n="1071" resp="#ebrooks"> Sic Syr. and Jo.
     Chrys.</note> Judas, for even he also, being an evil man, had gifts. And in the Old Testament
    one will accordingly find that the grace often worked in men who were unworthy, in order to
    benefit others. For, since all had not readiness for all things, but some were pure in life, but
    had not an equal amount of faith, while others were in the converse position, he both entices
    the former by means of the latter in order that they may show great faith, and calls the latter
    by means of this incomprehensible grace to become virtuous. Wherefore also he used to gave the
    grace with great abundance, for '"We did many mighty works". But then will I profess unto them
    "I know you not". For now they think they are my friends, but then they will know that I did not
    give as to friends'. And why are you surprised if he gave his graces to men who had believed in
    him but had not a life consonant to the faith, when he is in fact found to work even in men who
    have fallen from both? For Balaam was an alien both to faith and to life; but nevertheless the
    grace was effected in him for <pb n="411"/> the sake of influencing others. And Pharaoh
    likewise; but nevertheless to him also as well he showed the future. And Nebuchadnezzar was a
    great transgressor of the law; and to him again he revealed things that should happen later
    after many generations. And to his son again who surpassed his father in transgression of the
    law he showed the future, in that he brought wonderful and great things to pass. Since therefore
    at that time also the proclamation was at its beginning, and it very was desirable that a
    display of its power should be made, many even among the unworthy also received gifts. But
    nevertheless those men gained nothing from these signs, but are even judged all the more.
    Wherefore also he said to them those terrible words, 'I never knew you'. For many he already
    hates even here, and before the judgment turns away from them"<note type="footnote" n="1072"
     resp="#ebrooks">Op. Cit., xxxv, l, 2 (ed. Par. 2a, VII, 340).</note>. By means of all these
    things therefore he clearly establishes the fact that Balaam also and Nebuchadnezzar, and
    Belteshazzar the latter's son, and all such men, did not profit by the grace of God, in that
    they remained in the snares of demon-worship, but even endure the decrees of the sentences of
    tortures all the more.<pb n="412"/><supplied reason="ellipsis" resp="#compiler">(<emph rend="ital">And
      after other things.</emph>)</supplied> But, as to the tunic of God our Saviour Jesus, on which those
    who performed the crucifixion cast lots, your mightiness' love of God should know that we should
    understand the statement exactly according to the letter. In Palestine it is the custom for men
    to make such tunics as are divided in the middle and not woven together throughout, but contain
    the sections of the texture separately; so that even now we may see many such tunics, made of
    wool and linen, in the city of Gaza; since afterwards, when it is about to be put on, and is
    skilfully and becomingly folded, that division is concealed by the tailors. But some<note
     type="footnote" n="1073" resp="#ebrooks"> (V) 'all'.</note> of those who are of low station
    have it all woven together from beginning to end, and these they <pb n="413"/> describe
    according to custom as being woven from the top to the bottom, since there is no division in
    them. But this indicates also a mystery which shows<note type="footnote" n="1074"
     resp="#ebrooks">A.v. (E) 'is further also shown by the mystery which appears in it'.</note>
    that the Only Word who was born below in flesh is above from God and the Father. Since every
    human soul has a body like some garment which springs up with it, as is said by Job the man of
    mighty endurance to God: "With skin and flesh hast thou clothed me, and with bones and sinews
    hast thou strengthened me"<note type="footnote" n="1075" resp="#ebrooks">Job, x, 11.</note>, so
    also our Saviour's body, if one conceives of it as a kind of tunic that sprang up at the same
    time, because it was united to the Word invariably by a natural union, was woven from the top,
    that is by the coming of the Holy Spirit, and not by human seed. That these things are so the
    genuine doctors of the holy church also show; for it is good that <pb n="414"/> we confirm every
    statement and opinion by the expressions used by these. John who became bishop of Constantinople
    in the 85th homily of the commentary on the Gospel of John wrote as follows: "But do you, I
    pray, observe the prophet's accuracy; for the prophet did not say only that they divided, but
    also that they did not divide. Some things they divided, but the tunic they did not divide, but
    also committed the matter to lot. But the expression 'woven from the top' is not added casually;
    but some say that by means of this expression one thing is indicated in place of another,
    because he who was crucified was not mere man, but had also the Godhead from above; while others
    say that the evangelist is depicting the actual pattern of the tunic, for, since in Palestine
    they join two pieces of material together and so weave garments, John signifies that the tunic
    was not<note type="footnote" n="1076" resp="#ebrooks">The negative, required by the sense, is
     not in the Greek.</note> of this kind, in that he says that it was woven from the top. And this
    it seems to me that he says by way of signifying the meanness of the garments, and, as in all
    other things, so also in raiment he followed a simple form"<note type="footnote" n="1077"
     resp="#ebrooks">In Jo. Hom. LXXXV, 1, 2 (ed. Par. 2a VIII, 576).</note>. And Athanasius the
    great in the homily on the Cross says these things: "Together with these things <pb n="415"/> he
    put on also an unsewn tunic that was woven from the top throughout, that from this also the Jews
    might be able to believe who and whence he is who put on these things; that the Word is not from
    the earth, but that he came from above, and he is not one divided, but is without division from
    the Father; because, when he became man, he had not a body that was sewn together from a man and
    a woman, but one that was woven from a virgin alone by the Spirit's workmanship"<note

    But, as to the passage about the sweat and the drops of blood, know that in the divine and
    evangelical Scriptures that are at Alexandria it is not written. Wherefore also the holy Cyril
    in the 12th of the books written by him on behalf of the religion of the Christians against the
    impious demon-worshipper Julian plainly stated as follows: "But, since he said that the divine
    Luke inserted among his own words the statement that an angel stood and strengthened Jesus, and
    his sweat dripped like blood-drops or blood, let him learn from us that we have found nothing of
    this kind inserted in Luke's work, unless perhaps<note type="footnote" n="1079" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἂρα</foreign>.</note> an interpolation has been made <pb n="416"/>
    from outside which is not genuine. The books therefore that are among us contain nothing
    whatever of this kind; and I therefore think it madness for us to say anything to him about
    these things; and it is a superfluous thing to oppose him on things that are not stated at all,

   <p> But the Lord, when after the Resurrection he breathed upon the disciples <pb n="417"/> and
    said, "Receive the Holy Spirit"<note type="footnote" n="1085" resp="#ebrooks">John xx.
     22.</note>, (since you ask this question also besides), gave them a beginning only of the gifts
    of the Spirit, and, as one may say, one kind among the many gifts of the Spirit which Paul
    enumerated in writing to the Corinthians<note type="footnote" n="1086" resp="#ebrooks">I Cor.
     xii, 7-10.</note>, I mean that of binding and loosing men's sins. This was signified by the
    addition, in that that Giver of the gifts of the Spirit said, "If ye forgive any men's sins they
    shall be forgiven to-them; and if ye bind any men's sins they shall be bound"<note
     type="footnote" n="1087" resp="#ebrooks">John xx, 23.</note>. And by means of the breathing he
    taught them in very mysterious fashion that he is himself the Creator of Adam, whom he formed
    out of earth and into whose face he breathed the Spirit of life, and that he made man 'a living
    soul' as it is written<note type="footnote" n="1088" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. ii, 7.</note>, shining
    in the spiritual image and the beauty that flashes from it, and sharing in the divine likeness.
    And by breathing into the disciples he majestically shows that the Holy Spirit himself is of his
     essence<note type="footnote" n="1089" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >οὐσία</foreign>.</note> and not alien.</p>
   <p>And in addition to that you ask this other question, how then we are able to explain how it is
    that our Lord Christ does not speak falsely who says, "As Jonah was three days and three nights
    in the fish's belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
     <pb n="418"/> earth<note type="footnote" n="1090" resp="#ebrooks">Ms. om.</note>"<note
     type="footnote" n="1091" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. XII, 40.</note>. Some say that we are to reckon
    the time from the very evening of the 5th day of the week when our Saviour supped with the
    disciples, and instituted the new Passover, causing the old to cease, since it was from that
    time that our Lord was virtually sacrificed of his own accord on our behalf, and went down into
    the lower parts of the earth, and they say that the one night and the six hours of the
    preparation should be reckoned as one day and night, and the darkness from the 6th hour to the
    9th and the light from the 9th hour till sunset as the 2nd day and night, so that
    consequentially the following night and the sabbath-day make up the whole of the 3rd day and
    night, and in this way it is to be believed that our Lord rose after three days and nights. But
     others<note type="footnote" n="1092" resp="#ebrooks">Dionysius of Alexandria; see Conybeare in
     Journ. Theol. Stud., XV, 440.</note> have appeared to give another elucidation upon the
     question<note type="footnote" n="1093" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >θεωρία</foreign>.</note> before us, which is subtle and very accurate. They said that
    according to the custom and tradition contained in Scripture every day with the night preceding
    it are<note type="footnote" n="1094" resp="#ebrooks">Sic Syr.</note> combined into one entity.
    Thus in Exodus, when Moses was giving orders about the Passover and about the feast of
    unleavened bread, he said, "When the 14th day of the 1st month beginneth, ye <pb n="419"/> shall
    eat unleavened bread from the evening"<note type="footnote" n="1095" resp="#ebrooks">Ex. XII,
     18.</note>, and he counted the beginning of the following day from the preceding evening: and
    the cessation of the sabbath he instituted the same way, so that they were to cease from work on
    the preceding night and the following day; and the Jews are known to observe this down to this
    day, and to honour not the night after the sabbath but the night before the sabbath by cessation
    and- abstention from work; and we ourselves on the Ist day of the week honour the preceding
    night as united with the honoured day, and not the night following. Accordingly therefore they
    say that every night-and-day is as one may say one entity, and, what therefore anyone does
    during one of these 24 hours, that act is said to have been performed on the whole of that day.
    As for instance, when a man is sent on a long journey and returns to his own country or city
    either on the 2nd or on the 3rd day of the week, this man entered the city during one hour or a
    small portion of an hour, but everyone says, "So-and-so arrived on the 2nd day of the week" or
    "on the 3rd", and they reckon the whole day which is one with the preceding night to his
    arrival. <pb n="420"/> And therefore, they say, we should on this principle regard the period of
    the three days' burial, and the descent of our God and Saviour who became incarnate into Sheol,
    as beginning from the time when he truly entered the heart of the earth; and that he did after
    he gave up his spirit, saying, "My Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit"<note
     type="footnote" n="1096" resp="#ebrooks">Luke xxiii, 46.</note>, and then his spirit departed,
    and thus, though he was united in a perfect union, the soul and the body were separated from one
    another, and through the burial of the body he does away corruption in graves, and through the
    soul he is seen in the lower parts' of the earth, and he released those who were bound in
    graves. Then it was therefore that he entered the heart of the earth, when 'he went down', as
    Paul says, 'to the lower parts of the earth'<note type="footnote" n="1097" resp="#ebrooks">Eph.
     iv, 9.</note>, that is to the lowest limits and to the gloomy crowns (?)<note type="footnote"
     n="1098" resp="#ebrooks">This word is probably corrupt.</note> in the earth; From the departure
    of the spirit therefore the three day-and-nights are to be counted; and the departure took place
    at the 9th hour of the preparation, when three hours of the day remained. Since therefore the
    preparation is according to the custom handed down in Scripture united with the preceding night,
    we reckon that our Lord spent the whole of the day and the night of the preparation in the heart
    of the earth, and then after sunset the sabbath begins and its <pb n="421"/> night, the day
    which the Jews honour by a cessation; and the whole of this together with the following day
    which is joined to it our Lord spent in the lower parts of the earth. But, when the sabbath had
    gone by, and had been completed by the, setting of the sun, then began the night of the 1st day
    of the week; and the night again and the day following it are to be reckoned in order according
    to that same custom of Scripture, and our Lord will be found to have risen from the place of the
    dead on the 3rd day-and-night, that of the 1st day of the week; for in fact one who passed the
    beginning of a day-and-night in the heart of the earth is to be reckoned as having spent the
    whole of that day-and-night there. For this reason they say that Christ spent the preparation in
    the lower parts of the earth as regards the last portion of the day-and-night, and the 1st day
    of the week as regards the first portion, and the sabbath entirely through all the #twenty-four#
    hours, keeping the day of the Jews' feast in mourning, that thereby also he might fulfil the
    prophecy spoken through the prophet Amos, which threatens the Jews and says, "I will turn your
    feasts into mourning, and all your songs into wailing"<note type="footnote" n="1099"
     resp="#ebrooks">Amos, viii, 10.</note>. But those men say also that the three hours' darkness
    which took place is reckoned to be a night, and this is forced; for this darkness is not a
    night, <pb n="422"/> but an affliction of day; and they say that they are prevented from holding
    anything of the kind by the prophecy of Zechariah also, who prophesies about that day as
    follows: "On that day there shall be no light, and cold and frost shall be one day, and that day
    shall be known to the Lord, neither day nor night, and towards evening there shall be
     light"<note type="footnote" n="1100" resp="#ebrooks">Zech. xiv, 6, 7.</note>. See! the prophet
    plainly says, "On that day there shall be no light", and, having first plainly named the
    darkness, he prevented such an affliction and the light which rose afterwards from being
    reckoned a night and a day by saying "neither day nor night"; and this he says plainly, in order
    that no one may reckon this a day and a night. As to the statement, "Cold and frost shall be one
    day", it is not unreasonable for us to understand it to mean that there was actually sensible
    cold and frost on that day; and supra-sensually that, because at a certain time fiery fervour
    had grown cold among the Jews, the grace of the Holy Spirit ceased to work among them<note
     type="footnote" n="1101" resp="#ebrooks">Ms. om.</note>. This also besides we should know, that
    our Lord in the gospels sometimes said that he was destined to rise on the 3rd day, and
    sometimes that he would rise after three days, the expression signifying that even the beginning
    of the 3rd day is reckoned a whole day. <pb n="423"/>

   <p> You should know that the priest who offers represents the great God and our Saviour Jesus
    Christ; for he in fact celebrates the memory of the sacrifice which he himself instituted, and
    of that which he himself began in the mysterious supper.</p>
   <p>The veil therefore which before the priest approaches hides what is set forth and is removed
    after his entry manifestly cries by the mouth of the facts themselves that the mystery, which
    was previously concealed by means of the sacrifices of the law and the shadowy service, and was
    obscurely made known as it were by an indication only, by means of this spiritual and rational
    priestly ministration reveals Christ who is God to those who have believed on him. <pb n="427"/>
   </p>
   <p>To this refer also the words which Paul uses in the epistle to the Corinthians, "The veil
    remaineth upon the readers of the Old Testament, and it is not revealed because<note

    indeed done away or has removed the veil by means of the service and ministration in the Spirit,
    as is further stated by Paul himself, "We all with open face see the glory of the Lord as in a
     mirror"<note type="footnote" n="1114" resp="#ebrooks">Ibid., 19.</note>. For what is done with
    the veil shows according to a simple explanation that things that are hidden from and not [seen]
    by those who initiate, these are manifest and visible to those who believe and are initiated.
    [In] Palestine and in Jerusalem, while the priest makes the said<note type="footnote" n="1115"

    frequently and ceaselessly lift [the cover]<note type="footnote" n="1116">This is the sense
     required.</note> up and let it down again, until the end of the prayer, and so after that the
    priest begins the petition over the offering of the sacrifice. Further what is done in this
    fashion reminds us of that veil or linen sheet which came down from heaven upon Peter, which
    contained all the quadrupeds and reptiles, and birds clean and unclean, and signified to him
    that <pb n="428"/> the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out not only on the people of Israel
    which was clean, because it received God's law, but upon all the nations which were without the
    law and unclean.</p>
   <p>For this reason therefore the cloth that is laid upon what is set forth on the altar shows by
    being lifted and lowered the abundant and perfect gift of the divine Spirit, which was shown to
    Peter by the vision to have included all the nations, which descends from heaven upon [all] that
    is set forth, and consecrates and hallows it<damage><supplied resp="#ebrooks">.....</supplied></damage><note type="footnote"

    sound words of the teaching. For a mind that is so disposed God reckons in place of a sacrifice,
    and above every gift and fruit-offering of the foolish, who know not how to do good, nor yet
    will learn from those who know. Therefore he who said, "Keep thy foot when thou goest into a

    did not dare to bring a railing accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke thee"<note
     type="footnote" n="1124" resp="#ebrooks">Jude 9, 13, 16.</note>, which seems to me to convey
    the following meaning. The law which was given through Moses showed all the things that relate
    to the cleansing of the soul and its justification <pb n="431"/> by means of bodily types and
    indications. Such is the fact that it passes judgment upon the body of a leper as unclean, and
    similarly also upon a man with an issue; for God does not exact punishment for involuntary
    afflictions, but by means of these things annuls the stain of sin which is diverse and hard to
    wash away, by which the soul is in divers manners stained. After this pattern therefore he
    judges it pollution that the man should be dissipated on pleasures who begets fruits for the
    benefit of the rational and intelligent soul<note type="footnote" n="1125" resp="#ebrooks">The
     following to 'day' (p. 433, 1. 2) is published in Greek in Cramer, Cat. in Epp. Cath., p.

    happens to the soul. Since, when the soul is separated from the body after the release from this
    world, the angelic and good hosts and a company of evil demons meet it, in order that, according
    to the quality of the deeds which it has performed bad or good, either the one or the other may
    convey it to the proper regions to be kept till the last day, on which, we shall all rise,
    either to judgment<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks">Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶς κρίσιν
      πάντες παραστησόμεθα. κ</foreign>.</note> or to eternal life, or shall be brought to the
    unending flame of the fire, therefore, because God wished <pb n="432"/> to show this to the sons
    of Israel by some bodily type, he caused the burial of Moses to appear before their eyes at the
    time of the swathing<note type="footnote" n="1126" resp="#ebrooks">Mss. 'hiding.'; Gr.

    authoritatively rebuke him, but yielded the judgment against that demon to the Lord of all, and
    said, "The Lord rebuke thee", that by means of these things those who are being instructed may
    learn that that the soul has a contest after the release from this world, and that we must by
    means of good deeds pre'pare ourselves in order that angelic help may come to us when the demons
    gnash their teeth enviously and bitterly at us. And, when this sight had appeared before the
    eyes, then there fell in that place a ray of light of a cloud<note type="footnote"

    </note> that darkened and obstructed the sight of those who were standing on this side and that,
    that no man might know his grave. Therefore the Holy Scripture says in Deuteronomy also: "Moses
    the Lord's bondman ended his life there, in the land of Moab, by the word of the Lord; and they
    buried him there in <pb n="433"/> the land of Moab beside the house of Peor, and no man hath
    known the end or his grave to this day"<note type="footnote" n="1127">Deut. xxxiv, 5, 6.</note>;
    which is also confirmed by that which the evangelist wrote<note type="footnote" n="1128"
     resp="#ebrooks">This is the best emendation of a corrupt passage that I can make, but I do not

    to be the interpretation of what he propounded, so that I thus understand it. But some have said
    that Jude calls the law itself the body of Moses; and, when he came down to show this to the
    sons of Israel, the devil opposed, and he worked in opposition retarding the gift of the law,
    and contending and saying, "The people does not deserve this to be done for them"; and therefore
    Michael went before him and drove away him who opposed, uttering the rebuke, "The Lord rebuke

    Certain men with experience of war say that generals<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"
      ><foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</foreign>.</note> of <pb n="435"/> armies have a custom of
    bringing besides the armed forces physicians also, and, after the hosts engage with one another
    and the battle is joined, and the opposite side is defeated, they send the physicians to search
    among the fallen, and examine carefully lest there be found a man among them who is warm and has
    breath in him, and may by medical skill recover from the deadly wounds that are upon him.
    Therefore also the purport of this figurative prophecy which we have cited is that, when Israel
    was reckoned with the dead, he restored him to life; but some have not discovered the meaning
    contained in this figure, or the explanation of the words, 'I found a hot one in the
    wilderness', but have given a foolish interpretation. They changed the reading 'hot', and
    instead of saying 'hot' said 'solitary', and supposed from this that there is some herb which
    grows of itself in the wilderness, and signifies the solitariness of Israel. For it is not so.
    The words of the following context refute and truly banish their supposition; and the words of
    Scripture are as follows: "I found a hot one in the wilderness with the slain of the sword". So
    therefore I also am in this manner lifted up, and am constrained to take courage and speak a few
    words about the communications that have been addressed to me by your eloquent wisdom.</p>

    it in a miraculous manner, the divine John the Evangelist recorded, and no one else wrote about
    this. But certain persons have clearly falsified the Gospel of Matthew and inserted this same
    passage, when the contrary is the fact, in order to show that it was while he was alive that the
     soldier<note type="footnote" resp="#compiler"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >στρατιώτης</foreign>.</note> pierced his side with the spear, and afterwards he gave up the
     ghost<note type="footnote" n="1132" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. xxvii, 49. See Tischendorf ad loc.,
     where this passage of Sev. is cited from Assemani, Bibl. Or., II, 81.</note>. This question was
    examined with great carefulness when my meanness was in the royal city, at the time when the
    affair of Macedonius was being examined, who became archbishop of that city, and there was
    produced the Gospel of Matthew, which was written in large letters, and was preserved with great
    honour in the royal palace, which was said to have been found in the days of Zeno of honourable
    memory in a city of the island of Cyprus buried with the holy Barnabas, who went about with Paul
    and spread the divine preaching; and, when the Gospel of Matthew was opened, it was found to be
    free from the falsification contained in this addition, <pb n="437"/> of the story of the
     soldier<note type="footnote" resp="#compiler"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
     >στρατιώτης</foreign>.</note> and the spear. I do not know how and for what reason the holy
    John who became bishop of the same royal city, and the admirable Cyril, bishop of Alexandria,
    did not test this question, and allowed the two passages to stand, in the two evangelists,
    neglecting the evidence to the contrary;<note type="footnote" n="1133" resp="#ebrooks">The
     passage is not in the extant fragments of Cyril's commentary on Matth. For Jo. Chrys. see
     below.</note> but perhaps in order that this also might be known, that, while they speak and
    write everything under the operation of the Holy Spirit, and while these men are higher than we
    (for we are men who creep along the earth), as the heaven is higher than the earth<note
     type="footnote" n="1134" resp="#ebrooks">The sentence is not completed.</note>, and that they
    themselves also might be known to be men, and to leave omniscience to God only, and that there
    is something in affairs which cannot be expressed, the complete revelation of which is not made
    known. Thus Samuel also, who as one may say saw with the eye of prophecy everything that was
    about to happen, did not know Saul when he was present and standing among all Israel, Because
    God by means of these things was instructing his bondmen, and teaching them to pay regard to
    humility. Wherefore also the divine Scripture is written thus: "And Samuel asked in the Lord and
    said, 'Cometh that man hither?' And the Lord said, ' Lo! he is hidden among the vessels'. And
     <pb n="438"/> he ran and took him thence"<note type="footnote" n="1135" resp="#ebrooks">1 Sam.
     x, 22, 23.</note>. And at the time when the Shilumite woman's son died, and she had come to
    Elisha in great distress, as a mother who had been deprived of her beloved son, and, when she
    had just fallen at the feet of the prophet of God, and Gehazi tried to prevent her, the bondman
    of God, being moved by love and sorrow, said to Gehazi, "Let her alone, because her soul is
    bitter in her, and the Lord hid it from me and showed it not to me"<note type="footnote"
     n="1136" resp="#ebrooks">2 Kings iv, 27.</note>. Accordingly you should know that Eusebius of
    Caesarea also who is called 'Pamphili', who wrote the canons of the gospel, and imitated those
    who wrote on this subject before him, and had more complete knowledge of this question than the
    others, in the 10th canon, in which he recorded the places peculiar to one of the evangelists,
    inserted this passage also about the soldier<note type="footnote" resp="#compiler"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">στρατιώτης</foreign>.</note> and the lance, saying that John alone recorded
     it<note type="footnote" n="1137" resp="#ebrooks">Novum Testamentam, ed. Lloyd and Sanday, p.
     xx; P. G,, XXII, 1292.</note>. And we also agree with this careful accuracy, not that we
    contend against our fathers (far be it!), but that we place the evangelists at a greater height
    than them, and assign to the evangelists only the intention which properly belongs to them, in
    order that in everything Jesus, who is God, who spoke in the <pb n="439"/> evangelists, may be
    glorified, 'in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden'<note type="footnote"
     n="1138" resp="#ebrooks">Col. ii, 3.</note>, according to the saying of Paul. But for the rest
    we find that the holy John himself also, the bishop of Constantinople, in the commentary on the
    same Matthew the Evangelist with regard to this same addition which we are now discussing,
    himself also said things that fit the truth; for he expressed himself thus: "'But another came
    up and perforated his side with a lance'. And what could be more wicked than these men? And who
    could be lawless like them? And who could be more savage than these same men, who showed their
    madness to such an extent, that they attacked a dead body. But do you mark how their madness was
    brought about for our salvation. For after the wound the fountain of life welled forth for
     us"<note type="footnote" n="1139" resp="#ebrooks">In Matth. Hom. LXXXVIII, 1 (ed. Par. 2a, VII,
     932).</note>. But these are the words of a man who follows the footsteps of the narrative of
    John the Evangelist and nothing else; for he called the body 'dead'; because it was after he
    gave up the ghost that the soldier<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >στρατιώτης</foreign>.</note> pierced him, and gave occasion for the fountain of our salvation
    to well forth thence, as the doctor John the bishop said. But this addition to the narrative of
    Matthew the Evangelist has never been inserted by any of the earlier <pb n="440"/> commentators
    who wrote, not by Origen, who examined such questions minutely, though he sinned<note

    little above, when writing to a man called Marinus about questions concerning the passions of
    our Saviour and about his Resurrection, showed us nothing whatever about the said addition, as
    being unknown and having no place in the books of the gospel. But in the same letters to
    Marinus, who had asked him for an interpretation on the subject of our Saviour's passions and
    his Resurrection, he inserted the following exposition also in his letters, that the divine Mark
    the Evangelist said that it was the 3rd hour at the time when Christ who is God and our Saviour
    was crucified, but the divine John (he said) wrote that it was at the 6th hour that Pilate sat
    upon his judgment-seat at the place called 'the pavement', and judged Christ. And therefore
    Eusebius said that this is an error of a scribe, who was inattentive when writing <pb n="441"/>
    the Gospel<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγοραθὲν</foreign>
     (conj. Cr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">παραγραφθὲν</foreign>, P. G., <foreign xml:lang="grc"

      Εὐαγγέλια</foreign>.</note>. For it is the letter gamal that denotes 3 hours, while the letter
    which is called in Greek episemon denotes the number of 6 hours, and these letters are like one
    another in Greek, and, the scribe wishing to write '3' quickly, and having turned the letter a
    little backwards, it was thereby found to be '6', because, since the letter had been turned
    backwards, it was supposed to be the letter that denotes '6'. Since therefore the three other
    evangelists Matthew, Mark, and Luke stated alike as with one mouth that from the 6th hour to the
    9th there was darkness over all the land, it is plain that our Lord and God Jesus Christ was
    crucified before the 6th hour, at which the darkness took place, that is from the 3rd hour,
     as<note type="footnote" n="1142" resp="#ebrooks">Some words have perh. fallen out; Gr. <foreign

    the 3rd hour, because those who wrote before, as we have said, changed the letter. We must
    insert also in this our letter upon this matter a part of what Eusebius himself stated at
    length; and his words are as follows: "We agree not with any chance man, but with the evangelist
    who gave this testimony, <pb n="442"/> Mark. For it happened that there was an error on the part
    of the scribe so that he changed the letter by adding length to it, and it was thought that the
    letter which represents '3' was '6', on account of the likeness of the two letters [of that
    which denotes '3' and that which denotes '6'. If the refore it is stated by John that it was the
    preparation of the day of unlevened bread, and it was about the 6th hour, and Pilate said to the
    Jews "Behold! your king"<note type="footnote" n="1143" resp="#ebrooks">John xix, 14.</note>, and
    so on, let there be read instead of '6th' '3rd', since the beginning of his trial took place at
    that time, and in the middle of the hour or after it had been completed they crucified him, so
    that the result is that they judged and crucified him at the same hour"<note type="footnote"

    addressed to Marinus about the interpretation of these things, you will find the accuracy of the

    things and occupied with these things in priestly fashion, and rousing up the gloom of our

   <p> For against that contention we must vigorously make answer, that in <pb n="445"/> the
    composition or fashioning of man the rational soul of man is not created before the body, nor is
    the body formed before the soul. Why do you drag the teaching of the holy fathers which says
    that the divine inspiration is the Holy Spirit, an active and operative force, and is the power
    which makes the soul of man, to an abominable objection by saying this, that they who say this
    absolutely and by all means clearly hold that the body is created first, and after the formation
    is complete receives a soul, in that the Holy Scripture says, "And God created man dust from the
    earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life"<note type="footnote" n="1151"
     resp="#ebrooks">Gen. II, 7.</note>, as if the formation comes first, and the animation follows
    afterwards, in the second place, according to the narrative of Scripture? But we shall not
    arrive at this cold supposition, if we receive in our mind that God creates, not like some
    feeble man. <supplied reason="ellipsis" resp="#compiler">(<emph rend="ital">A little farther
     on.</emph>)</supplied> It would perhaps be possible for us to adduce other testimonies also that the
    human soul was created by divine inflation; but indeed this stands clear, that the holy Cyril
    taught all of them in his writings, showing that the soul of man came into being by divine
    inflation, and again that we are to <pb n="446"/> understand that, man having been created and
    possessing a soul, the inflation inserted only spiritual gifts and patterns of divine
    association.</p>
   <p>And the holy Basil in what he wrote about the Holy Spirit taught as follows: "For, when Adam
    had lost the grace derived from the divine inflation, Christ gave it back again, when he
    breathed into the face of his disciples and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'"<note

    breathed in intellect, he is not another diifering from him who breathed at the beginning, but
    the same through whom he gave the inflation, then giving it with the soul, but now giving the
    soul". So much we have written as an abundant elucidation of the words, "Let us make man in our

    that is manifest to make known something that is not manifest, whom Christ's descent into Sheol
    benefited, viz. the saints who had already purified their soul. For, when he went thither, he
    made proclamation to the spirits in prison also who had aforetime been disobedient according to
    the statement of the apostle Peter<note type="footnote" n="1168" resp="#ebrooks">1 Pet. iii, 19,

    his Son"; and a little further on: "How shall we able to live without him? whom the prophets

    rightly awaited, when he came, raised them from the place of the dead"<note type="footnote"
     n="1175">Ad Magn., viii, ix.</note>. You see that those who like the prophets lived in Jesus
    Christ, that is in justice and saintly deeds, benefited by our Saviour's descent into Sheol;
    many of whose bodies arose, and appeared for the confirmation only of the power of him who went
    down into the lower parts of the earth as I said, not to give the recompense of the resurrection

   <p> But they are conscious of services and prayers, and especially those that are made over the
    bloodless sacrifice on behalf of their life; and assuredly <pb n="455"/> some consolation
    results to them in proportion to the measure of each man's character. And they are conscious too
    of alms given to the poor on their behalf; for they also are a rational sacrifice as Paul
    teaches this and says, "To give alms and to impart forget not; for such sacrifices please
     God"<note type="footnote" n="1179" resp="#ebrooks">Heb. xiii, 16.</note>. For that those who
    have fallen asleep in Christ are conscious of these things the ritual also which was handed down
    to the churches from of old by the apostles and from the beginning to the present day clearly
    witnesses; for the deacon makes proclamation to those who are standing while the bloodless
    sacrifice is being offered that they are to make supplication on behalf of those who have fallen
    asleep, and on behalf of those on whose behalf they are making commemorations and alms. But it
    is not lawful for us to say that any of the things enjoined in the holy churches is useless or
    vain.</p>
   <p>Of the same holy Severus, from the same 20th hypomnestikon.</p>
   <p>From the God-inspired Scripture we learn that in the resurrection both the just shall see the
    just and the sinners the sinners; but the just also <pb n="456"/> shall see the sinners who have
    conducted themselves in a manner opposite to their own being sent to the endless torments, and
    the sinners also shall gaze from afar at the righteous who have been injured by them enjoying
    pleasures. And this is a kind of punishment which they will bear in addition to their torments
    in the pains, that of being tormented by remorse, and then they will know from what good things
    they have fallen. These things the Lord taught us in the gospel as in an image and type
    delineated beforehand, by means of the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. Lazarus, having been
    justified by endurance in the distresses of poverty, was known by righteous Abraham, and was
    resting in his bosom; and the rich man also when judgment was being exacted from him for his
    sins, and his mercilessness towards Lazarus, while he was in the flame that is not quenched,
    from afar saw and knew Lazarus. This the Book of Wisdom also shows, in that it clearly depicts
    the wicked as knowing on the day of judgment the just who have been set at naught and evil
    entreated by them; and it speaks thus: "And they shall come to perception of their sins in fear;
    and their iniquity shall stand up against them and reprove them. Then shall the just man stand
    up with great boldness against the face of those who afflicted him and spurned his labour. They
    shall see <pb n="457"/> and be troubled with sore fear, and they shall be amazed at the
    greatness of his salvation. And repenting in their soul they shall say, and in affliction of
    spirit they shall groan and say, 'This was he who was then to us fools for a derision and a
    parable and a reproach. His life we counted folly, and his death contemptible. How is it that he
    hath been counted among the sons of God and his inheritance is with the saints? Did we then err
    from the way of truth, and did the light of justice not shine upon us?'"<note type="footnote"
     n="1180">Sap., iv, 20; v. 6.</note> Lo! therefore they of whom we speak, who were friends to
    one another with the evil friendship that is of perdition, on the last day at the judgment shall
    recognise one another, and the just man, whom in this world they senselessly set at naught and
    derided, they shall see to have been counted among the sons of God and to be receiving
    inheritance with the saints; and so thereafter they shall be separated, the one party to the
    outer darkness as it is written<note type="footnote" n="1181" resp="#ebrooks">Matth. viii, 12;
     xxii, 13; xxv, 30.</note>, or to the fire that is not quenched, or to the gnashing of teeth and
    to the weeping and to the worm that undyingly torments, and to judgments that are sent in such
    forms, and the other to the blessed abodes in the kingdom of heaven. For the words "Let the
    wicked man be taken away that he see not the glory of the Lord"<note type="footnote" n="1182"
     resp="#ebrooks">Is. XXXVI, 10.</note> are spoken with this meaning, that he shall not <pb
     n="458"/> share in the glory of the Lord that is given to his just ones. Though<note
     type="footnote" n="1183">Marg. 'Very apt interpretation'. </note> they shall not come lo
    judgment nor stand before the judgment-seat<note type="footnote" resp="#ebrooks"><foreign
      xml:lang="grc">βῆμα</foreign>.</note> of Christ according to what is stated by the psalmist:
    "Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment"<note type="footnote" n="1184" resp="#ebrooks"
     >Ps. i, 5.</note>, yet still they will be aware what glory the just are enjoying, and of what
    they themselves have been deprived on account of their unbelief, in order that they may be
    tormented by this also. That it is the custom of Scripture to use the expression 'see' in place
    of 'share' or 'have experience' is made known by that which is stated by David also, "May the
    Lord bless thee out of Zion, and mayest thou look upon the good things of Jerusalem"<note
     type="footnote" n="1185" resp="#ebrooks"> Ps. cxxvii, 5.</note>. And Ezekiel the prophet shows
    that the grievous tyrants of the different peoples and the soldiers with them, who did evil with
    one another and armed themselves in sins, shall also be together in the eternal torments; for he
    said, "There is Assyria, and all his concourse"; and again, "There is Elam and all his host";
    and further on, "There were given Moshach and Thubel, and all their host"<note type="footnote"
     n="1186">Ez. xxxii, 22, 24, 26.</note>. But that those who have lived uprightly will know those
    whom they love in the future life Isaiah <pb n="459"/> the prophet clearly cries, in that he
    terms them deer, inasmuch as by means of their struggles against passions they trampled upon
    serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the the adversary (for a deer is a
    serpent-slaying animal); for he said thus: "There the does met one another, and saw one
    another's face. They passed over in number and none of them perished. They sought not one
    another, because the Lord commanded them, and his spirit gathered them"<note type="footnote"
     n="1187" resp="#ebrooks">Is. xxxi, 15, 16.</note>. And kinsmen shall know kinsmen, as the
    sacred Scripture teaches us, saying of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob who died, in one place, "he
    was added to his fathers", in another, "he was added to his kin", and again, "he was added to
    his people"<note type="footnote" n="1188" resp="#ebrooks">Gen. xxv, 8 (the best mss. have
      <foreign xml:lang="grc">λαόν</foreign>); xxxv, 29; XLIX, 33.</note>. And David the wise, who
    as a prophet was initiated in and saw the future hope beforehand, when he had buried his son,
    bathed and anointed himself, and changed his garments, and set out a table, saying, "Wherefore
    do I fast? Shall I be able to bring him back any more? I shall go to him, but he himself will
    not return to me"<note type="footnote" n="1189" resp="#ebrooks">2 Sam. XII, 23.</note>. He would
    not suddenly have been converted from that mournful sorrow to such great cheerfulness unless he
    had been assured that he should see the boy again living in the resurrection. The <pb n="460"/>
    doctors of the church, weaving words of consolation from these and similar thoughts and from
    scriptural indications, persuaded fathers and mothers who were mourning beyond measure that in
    the resurrection they would see and receive their children who had died, and in like manner
    kinsmen and friends.</p>
