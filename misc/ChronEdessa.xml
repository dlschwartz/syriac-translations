        </p>
        <p align="center"> No. 1.----THE CHRONICLE OF EDESSA. </p>
        <p>SOME of the early Christian writers refer in very eulogistic terms to the archives of
            Edessa. The archives were, of course, the public or royal library of the city, the
            existence and value of which cannot be called in question. It included both Greek and
            Oriental books, and was therefore a depository from which literary men could largely
            benefit. Moses of Chorene consulted the books while compiling his history of Armenia.
            Eusebius of Caesarea declares himself to have been indebted to this library for his
            account of the conversion of Edessa, the correspondence between Jesus Christ and king
            Abgar, and a few other matters true and false, to be read at the end of the first book
            of the ecclesiastical history. We have substantial reasons for saying that in the
            particular instance first mentioned, Eusebius was deceived; that the documents he quoted
            could not have been long written, as appears from further portions of the same story now
            in the British Museum, under the title of the <i>Acts of Addi.</i><sup><a href="#1"
                        ><sup>1</sup></a><i> </i>
            </sup>The estimation in which the Edessene archives were held, is shewn by the following
            sentence from an old Syriac chronicle, some extracts of which are given in Cowper's
                <i>Syrian Miscellanies:</i>----"In the year 309 of the era of Alexander of Macedon
            did our Redeemer appear in the world (<i>i. e., </i>about B.C. 2); and he was in the
            world thirty-three years according to the evidence of the true books of the archives of
            Edessa, which err in nothing, and which make everything known to us truly."<sup><i
                    > </i><a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup> This is something like the stereotyped
            phraseology for allusions to, the historical documents at Edessa. </p>
        <p> The Maronite, Joseph Simon Assemani, devotes a chapter of his great work, the
                <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis, </i>to the "Chronicle of Edessa." <a href="#3"
                    ><sup>3</sup></a> He gives the Syriac text of the Chronicle, with a Latin
            translation, introduction, and notes. Considering that the matter is of some importance,
            we propose to give a version of Assemani's introduction, and of the Chronicle itself.
            The introduction is to the following effect:---- </p>
        <p align="center">
            <i>The Chronicle of Edessa.</i>
        </p>
        <p> We have hitherto not discovered who was the author of the Edessene Chronicle, nor in
            what age he flourished. Yet it is <a name="p29"><span class="pb">|29</span></a>
            sufficiently plain that he followed the Catholic faith, because he declares that he
            admits four holy councils down to the year 838 of the Greeks, and also because he
            expressly rejects the opposers of the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, strongly
            commending their orthodoxy, which was a most certain mark of the Catholics of the time
            in which he lived. He seems, indeed, to have lived about the year of Christ 550, for he
            brought down his history to the year 540, as will shortly appear. That he copied it out
            of the archives of the Edessene church is shewn by its beginning, course, and end. In
            the beginning of the history he describes the flood of waters which overflowed Edessa
            under the emperor Severus and king Abgar, according to the acts formerly drawn up by the
            notaries, and preserved in the archives, and put by us into their proper place.
            Moreover, the author is almost wholly occupied in registering the series of bishops of
            Edessa, and in describing their deeds. He leaves off writing just when the Jacobite
            pastors began to invade that church. </p>
        <p> The epoch which he uses is that of the Greeks, also called that of the Seleucidae, or
            the Syro-Macedonian. He affirms that the Christian era was later by 309 years, according
            to the common opinion of the Edessenes. But if we look closely into the indictions which
            he sometimes mentions, and the days of the month and of the week, which he often
            mentions, it becomes evident that the aforesaid years are called 309, but are really
            311; and, therefore, the nativity of Christ, according to his view, fell in the three
            hundred and eleventh year of the Greeks, and not in the three hundred and ninth. That is
            plainly the case from what he writes of the earthquake at Antioch, and the death of
            Simeon Stylites, who he affirms was taken to heaven in the year 771 of the Greeks, on
            the second of September, and on the fourth day of the week, which answers to the vulgar
            era A.D. 460, not 462. He relates that the earthquake at Antioch happened in the year
            837 of the Greeks, on the 29th of May, and on the sixth day of the week, which will be
            A.D. 526, when May 29th fell on the Friday, not A.D. 528, when it could not happen on a
            Friday. To the year of the Greeks 850 he also adds the "second indiction," which
            nevertheless answers to 539 A.D., and not to 541. Therefore the vulgar Christian epoch,
            according to his view, must be later than the era of the Greeks 311 years, and not 309. </p>
        <p> He starts at the beginning of the kingdom of Edessa, which he ascribes to the year 180
            of the Greeks. He ends at the year of Christ 540, when the Persian war was waged between
            Justinian and Chosroes. Although he sometimes neglects the order of time or disturbs it,
            I think this is to be attributed rather to <a name="p30"><span class="pb">|30</span></a>
            the copyist than to the author. In publishing it, therefore, I shall first restore the
            events to their own place and order. Some notes which seem to throw light upon it or
            other histories I shall place in the margin. The Chronicle is intitled <i>A history of
                events by way of compendium.</i>

        <h3 align="center"> [Translation.] </h3>
        <p> 1. In the year 180 kings began to rule in Edessa. </p>
        <p> 2. In the year 266 Augustus Caesar was made emperor. </p>
        <p> 3. In the year 309 our Lord was born. </p>
        <p> 4. In the year 400 Abgar the king built a mausoleum for himself. </p>
        <p> 5. In the year 449 Marcion forsook the Catholic Church. </p>
        <p> 6. The year 465, in the month Tammuz, on the eleventh day<i> (i.e., </i>July 11th, 154
            A.D.), Bardesanes was born. </p>
        <p> 7. Lucius Caesar, with his brother, subjugated the Parthians to the Romans in the fifth
            year of his reign. </p>
        <p> 8. In the year 513, in the reign of Severus, and in the reign of Abgar the king, son of
            Maano the king, in the month Tishrin the latter (<i>i. e., </i>November), the fountain
            of water which proceeds from the great palace of Abgar the great king increased, and it
            prevailed, and it went up according to its former manner, and overflowed and ran out on
            all sides, so that the courts and the porches and the royal houses began to be filled
            with water. And when our lord Abgar the king saw it, he went up to the level ground on
            the hill above his palace, where dwell and reside those who do the work for the
            government. And while the wise men considered what to do to the waters which had so
            greatly increased, it happened that there was a great and violent rain in the night, and
            the Daisan (river) came, neither in its day, nor in its month. And strange waters came;
            and they encountered the <i>cataracts </i>(? flood gates) which were fastened with great
            pieces of iron which were overlaid upon them, and with bars of iron which supported
            them. But not prevailing against them, the waters rose like a great sea beyond the walls
            of the city. And the waters began to come down from the apertures of the wall into the
            city. And Abgar the king stood on the great tower which was called that of the Persians,
            and saw the water by the light of torches, and he commanded, and they took away the
            gates and the eight <i>cataracts </i>(? flood-gates) of the western wall of the city
            where the river flowed out. But that very hour the waters broke down the western wall of
            the city, and entered the city, and overthrew the great and beautiful palace of our lord
            the king, and they carried away everything that was found before them, the desirable and
            beautiful edifices of the city, whatever <a name="p31"><span class="pb">|31</span></a>
            was near the river on the south and on the north of it. And they destroyed the temple of
            the church of the Christians. And there were killed by that occurrence more than two
            thousand men, upon many of whom as they slept in the night the waters came suddenly, and
            they were drowned, and the city was filled with the sound of lamentation. </p>
        <p> And when Abgar the king saw this destruction which had befallen, he commanded that all
            the craftsmen of the city should remove their cottages (or huts) from near the river,
            and that no man should build near the river any cottage. And by the wisdom of measurers
            and men of skill the cottages were placed so that the breadth of the river might be
            increased, and they added to its former measure. For if the waters were many and strong,
            the width of the river was too small to receive the water of twenty-five brooks with
            what they gathered from all sides. And Abgar the king commanded that all who lived in
            the porch, and were occupied over against the river, from Tishrin the former to Nisan
            (October to April), should not lodge in their cottages, except the islanders (Gazireans)
            who kept the city, five of whom should lodge on the wall above the place where the
            waters entered the city all the time of winter, and when they perceived by night and
            heard the sound of strange waters, which began to enter the city, and whoever heard the
            sound and neglected it, and did not publish it, behold the waters should drown the
            contempt of him that despised the command of the king. And this commandment was decreed
            from this time wherein it was so to the end of the world. </p>
        <p> Our lord Abgar the king commanded, and there was built for him a building for his royal
            house----a winter house at Tabara ----and there he dwelt all the time of winter; and in
            summer he came down to the new palace which was built for him at the fountain head. And
            his nobles also built for themselves buildings to live in, in the neighbourhood in which
            the king was, in the high street (?) which is called Beth Saharoye. And in order to
            restore the welfare of the former city, Abgar the king commanded, and the tributes due
            from those within, and from those who dwelt in towns, and in hamlets, were remitted: and
            tribute was not demanded from them for five years, until the city was enriched with men,
            and was crowned with buildings. </p>
        <p> Now Mar Yahab Bar Shemesh, and Kajuma Bar Magartat, the scribes of Edessa, recorded this
            event, and the command of Abgar the king: and Bar Din and Bulid, who are prefects over
            the archives of Edessa, received and deposited it within them as trusted of the city
            (i.e., archivists.) <a name="p32"><span class="pb">|32</span></a>#nbsp# </p>
        <p> 9. And in the year 517, Abgar built a palace in his own citadel (? town). </p>

            Hiba of Edessa, and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, and Daniel of Haran, and Sophronius of Tela,
            and Theodoret of Cyrus. </p>
        <p> 64. The year 759, Hibas the bishop departed from Edessa on the first day in the month
            Canun the latter (January 1), and on the twenty-first day of the month Tammuz (July),
            Nonnus came in in his stead, and continued two years, and made a <i>hierateion
            </i>(sacristy) in the church. </p>
        <p> 65. Anno 760, arose Leo bishop in Rome. </p>
        <p> 66. Anno 762, a synod was assembled in the city of Chalcedon. </p>
        <p> 67. An. 763, Mar Isaac, a composer (an author) and abbot (or Archimandrite) was famous. </p>
        <p> 68. An. 769, in the month Tishriu the former (October), on the twenty-eighth, Hiba,
            bishop of Edessa, went to rest; and Nonnus came into his place, and built the house of
            Mar Johanan the Baptist, and (he constructed) a place for poor invalids, outside the
            gate of Beth Shemesh; and in the place for the poor he built the house of martyrs to Mar
            Cosma and Mar Damian. Now he built also convents and towers, and made bridges, and
            levelled the roads. </p>
        <p> 69. In the year 771, departed the blessed Simeon of "his column" (Stylites) from the
            world, on Elul the second (September 2), on Wednesday (the fourth day in the week), the
            time the eleventh hour. </p>
        <p> 70. The year 777, Leo built Callinicns in Osrhoene, and named it after his own name
            Leontopolis; and set in it also a bishop. </p>
        <p> 71. An. 782, Nonnus, bishop of Edessa, rested, and Cyrus became (bishop) in his stead. </p>
        <p> 72. An. 795, Leontius rebelled against Zeno, and reigned in Antioch two years. </p>
        <p> 73. An. 800, the school of the Persians was eradicated from Edessa. </p>
        <p> 74. An. 809, the (tribute of) gold was remitted to the artificers in all the land, in
            the month Iyar (May). </p>
        <p> 75. And on the sixth in the month Haziran (June), Cyrus, bishop of Edessa, rested, and
            Peter became (bishop) in his stead, <a name="p36"><span class="pb">|36</span></a> and he
            entered Edessa on the twelfth of Elul (September) of the same year. </p>
        <p> 76. An. 810, many locusts appeared, but did no great damage that year: but the herbage
            grew again. And there was a great earthquake. And the warm bath of the Iberians failed
            three days. And the city of Nicopolis was overthrown, and buried in it all its
            inhabitants, save the temple, and the bishop, and two Syncelli (sons of his cell). And a
            sign that was like a spear appeared in heaven many days, in the month Canun the latter
            (January). </p>
        <p> 77. Now Anastasius the king deposed Euphemius, bishop of Constantinople, from his place,
            and Macedon became bishop in his stead. </p>
        <p> 78. An. 811, many locusts came and destroyed and devoured all the produce. </p>
        <p> 79. An. 813, a great fire appeared on the side of the north, which blazed all night on
            the twenty-second of Ab (August). </p>
        <p> 80. An. 814, Cavades, king of the Persians, encamped against Amida, a city of Beth
            Naharotha (Mesopotamia), on the fifth day in the month Tishrin the former (October), and
            fought with it, and took it in ninety-seven days. </p>
        <p> 81. And in the month Elul (September) of that year, he came and encamped against Edessa,
            and by the grace of God, did it no harm, except that he burnt the house of Mar Sergius
            and the northern basilica of <i>Beth-maudiné </i>(the House of Confessors, see above,
            No. 18.) </p>
        <p> 82. An. 821, Peter, bishop of Edessa, rested on the day of the Sabbath of the
            resurrection (Saturday, April 10, 510 A.D.), and Paul was appointed instead of him. </p>
        <p> 83. And in the year twenty-one of the reign of Anastus (Anastasius), he commanded them
            to open the coffin of Euphemia the martyr, and to bring forth from thence the book which
            the synod that was assembled at Chalcedon had put there, and to burn it; and there came
            forth fire from thence, and smote upon the faces of those who wished to bring it out,
            and because of this Anastasius refrained from taking it away from thence and burning it. </p>
        <p> 84. But he removed Macedon, the bishop of Constantinople, because he did not
            anathematize the synod, and Timothy became (bishop) instead of him. </p>
        <p> 85. And in the twenty-fourth of the same Anastasius Vitalian rebelled against him. </p>
        <p> 86. An. 829, in the month Tammuz (July), on the ninth, Anastasius the king departed from
            the world, and Justin became (king) in his stead. <a name="p37"><span class="pb"
                    >|37</span></a>#nbsp# </p>
        <p> 87. And in the second year of the reign of Justin, which was An. 830, he thrust out of
            Antioch Severus, and Xenaias from Mabug, and everybody that received not the four
            synods. </p>
        <p> 88. Now such was the care and concern of the friend of God, king Justinian, that he
            wrote in the <i>diptychs </i>of the church the four holy synods, that is to say, that of
            Nicea, and that of Constantinople, and the first of Ephesus, and that of Chalcedon. </p>
        <p>89. And in An. 831 came the patrician (or Patricius) to Edessa to remove Paul in the
            month Tishrin the latter (November) on the fourth, and he urged him to do one of two
            things, either to receive the synod and continue on his seat, or if he would not be
            persuaded he would remove him from his seat. But he was not persuaded to do one of
            these, but fled and went in and stayed in the House of Baptism. Now when the patrician
            (or Patricius) saw that he was unpersuaded to do one of these, and was afraid of the
            command of the king, he was compelled to remove him from the House of Baptism, and
            conveyed him to Seleucia. And when the king heard that he had taken him from the House
            of Baptism, he commanded that he should return to his seat, in hope that he would repent
            and receive the synod. And Paul re-entered his seat in forty-four days, and he was a
            long time without receiving the synod, and when the king saw that he was not persuaded,
            he sent him to Euchata. And Paul departed from Edessa on Tammuz (July) 27, of the year
            833, and Asclepius was (bishop) instead of him, and entered Edessa on the 23rd of
            Tishrin the former (October), of the year 834, three months after Paul the bishop
            departed from Edessa.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p> 90. And in the month Canun the former (December), on the 24th in it, after the entering
            of Asclepius the bishop to Edessa, he expelled the Oriental monks, and all the monks
            their allies who were like them, because they did not consent to the synod of Chalcedon. </p>
        <p> 91. And in the year 836 many waters entered Edessa, the fourth time, and broke down the
            walls of it, and overturned its dwellings and drowned its children, and made in it much
            destruction. </p>
        <p> 92. And through this circumstance Asclepius fled from Edessa, and went up to Antioch the
            city to Euphrasius the patriarch, and he was there, more or less, seventy days, and he
            died there in Antioch on the 27th in the month Haziran of that year, and was buried
            there in Antioch. And on the 4th in the month Elul of the same year they brought his
            body from Antioch and buried it at Beth Mar Barlaha, by Mar Nonnus the bishop. <a
                name="p38"><span class="pb">|38</span></a>#nbsp# </p>
        <p> 93. And when Paul heard that Asclepius was dead he repented and offered a petition to
            Mar Justinian the patrician (<i>Patricius</i>),<i> </i>and he made also a <i>libellum
            </i>to Euphrasius the patriarch, and because of the <i>libellum </i>that he made, and
            because of the epistle of the illustrious and friend of God, Mar Justinian the patrician
                (<i>Patricius</i>), he was returned and restored to his seat, and he entered Edessa
            on the 8th in Adar (March) of the year 837, eight months after the death of Asclepius. </p>
        <p> 94. Now Paul the bishop lived after he returned to his seat the third time, eight months
                <i>minus </i>eight days; and on the 30th in the month Tishrin the former (October)
            of the year 838 Paul the bishop rested. </p>
        <p> 95. And Andreas became (bishop) in his stead, and entered Edessa on the 7th of the month
            Shebat of the same year 838. </p>
        <p> 96. And in the year 837 in the month Iyar (May), on the 29th in it on Friday at the
            seventh hour, there was a great and violent earthquake, and there fell by it much of
            Antioch, and overwhelmed its children, and suffocated its inhabitants. </p>
        <p> 97. And in that earthquake died also Euphrasius the patriarch, and was buried under the
            houses, and as they say he was crying out all day beneath the houses. Now after him
            Ephraim of Amida became bishop in Antioch, who had been <i>Comes </i>of the East. </p>
        <p> 98. An. 838 on day 1 in the month of Nisan, Mar Justinian became Caesar, and on the 10th
            in the month Ab of the same year king Justinian (Justin) rested, and Mar Justinian
            reigned alone. </p>
        <p> 99. And in An. 839, in the month Tishrin the latter, on the 15th in it, a great fire
            happened at Antioch, and burned much of what remained from the earthquake<i>; </i>but
            whence the origin of the fire remains unknown. </p>
        <p> 100. An. 842, in the month Tammuz, came down Mar Demosthenes to Edessa to command the
            Roman forces. </p>
        <p> 101. And in the month Canun the former of An. 843, on the 18th in the month, the Huns
            entered the Roman territory, and plundered and wasted as far as the country of the
            Alepponians, and to the <i>dodecaton </i>[twelfth milestone] from Antioch. And through
            this affliction Mar Demosthenes fell sick and died at the city of Tela, on the 10th in
            the month Canun the latter of the same year. </p>
        <p> 102. And in An. 843, in the month Elul of the same year, Mar Rufinus the patrician made
            peace between the Persians and the Romans, and this peace was prolonged to the year 851. </p>
        <p> 103. And in An. 844, in the month Canun the former in that year, Mar Andreas, bishop,
            departed from the world, and he <a name="p39"><span class="pb">|39</span></a> was
            deposited at Mar Barlaha's by the bones of Mar Nonnus and Mar Asclepius; and Addi became
            bishop instead of him, and entered Edessa on the 28th in the month Ab of An. 844. </p>
        <p> 104. In An. 13 of the reign of Justinian, which was the year 850, indiction <i>deutra
            </i>(the second), a sign like a spear appeared in heaven on the 5th of Tishrin the
            former (October). </p>
        <p> 105. And in the same year in the month Iyar (May) Chosroes king of the Persians broke
            the peace, and crossed over to the territory of the Romans, and laid waste Shura, and
            Haleb (Aleppo) and Antioch, and also took possession of Apamea, and turned and came as
            far as Edessa, but by the grace of God protecting it, he did no harm in it; but the
            great men of the city brought out to him, and he took away two <i>centenaria
            </i>(hundreds of pounds <i>or </i>talents) of gold, and he returned to his place. </p>
        <p>106. As we learn from the former histories, behold the waters have four times broken down
            the walls of the blessed [city] and overthrown its towers, and choked its children,
            since Messiah ascended to his glorious Father. The first time its walls were broken down
            was in the days of Severus the king of the Romans, which was An. 513, by the reckoning
            of the Ionians (Greeks), in the month Tishrin the latter. And the second time its walls
            were broken down was in the days of Diocletian the king, which was the year 614 in the
            month Iyar. And the third time its walls were broken down was in the days of Honorius
            and Theodosius the illustrious kings, which was. An. 724 in the month Adar, on the 18th
            in it, on the 3rd in the week (Tuesday), when Mar Rabula had become bishop in Edessa.
            And the fourth time they were broken down was in the days of Justin the king, which was
            the year 836, when Asclepius had become bishop in Edessa.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a><sup>

        <h3 align="center"> NOTES. </h3>
        <p> The <i>numbers </i>of the Notes correspond with the <i>sections </i>of the translation. </p>
        <p> 1. The year 180, <i>i.e. </i>of the Greeks, of the Seleucidae, or of the
            Syro-Macedonians, coincides, says Assemani, with B.C. 129. Dionysius places the
            commencement of the Edessene kingdom in B.C. 136, or, as he calls it, in the year of
            Abraham 1880.----"The year 1880 of Abraham, there began to reign over Edessa (Urhoi) the
            first King Orhoi, son of Hevia, five years, and after his name it was called Urhoi.'' No
            great antiquity is ascribed to the name of the city by this version of its story. </p>
        <p> 3. The chronicle of Edessa says, "In the year 309 our Lord was born," <i>i.e., </i>in
            the forty-fourth of Augustus. See Pagi in <i>Apparatu, </i>No. 157. </p>
        <p> 4. The Syriac is remarkable. Abgar "built a <i>naphsho </i>in honour of his death." The
            word <i>naphsho </i>is usually translated "soul," or " self," but is said sometimes to
            denote a sepulchre or mausoleum. Perhaps the word should be <i>nauso, </i>a shrine or
            temple. Assemani says this Abgar was Abgar Bar Ajazat, the nineteenth King of Edessa.
            Bayer thinks he was old when he began to reign, because he built a mausoleum for
            himself. <i>Bibl. Or., </i>i., 421; Bayer, <i>Hist. Osrhoena, </i>p. 147. </p>
        <p> 5. Marcion is joined with Manetes in the extracts from the Syriac Chronicle quoted in
                <i>Syriac Miscellanies, </i>p. 87. "In the year 448, Marcion and Manetes, heretics
            in Phrygia, were famous." This is a year earlier than the date above given. </p>
        <p> 6. Other dates have been given for Bardesanes. Thus in <i>Syriac Miscellanies, </i>p.
            87, we read that Bardesanes, who promulgated the doctrine of Valentinus, was famous or
            flourished in the year 479. If he were only born in 465 (A.D. 154) this can hardly be
            correct; but other authorities clearly imply an earlier date than that of the Edessene
            Chronicle. </p>
        <p> 7. This event really occupies an earlier place in the chronicle under the year 449,
            which Assemani says is wrong, and he has therefore corrected it. </p>
        <p> 8. Dionysius places this flood in A.D. 216. </p>
        <p> 9. This palace probably stood upon the hill where the citadel of modern Urfah now
            stands. </p>
        <p> 11. This overthrow of the walls in 303 was also caused by a flood, as shewn by Dionysius
            in his chronicle, and as stated below. The account of Dionysius, as quoted by Assemani,
            is to this effect,----" In the year 614 of Alexander, Edessa was taken by the waters,
            and its eastern walls were broken down and fell, and (the river) carried away and
            removed all that was in it; and the flood made great havoc in it, both upon men and
            cattle, and in all the plain of Edessa and Haran." <a name="p41"><span class="pb"
                    >|41</span></a>#nbsp# </p>
        <p> 13. This cemetery is perhaps the first on record constructed for the special use of
            Christians. </p>
        <p> 17. Jacob of Nisibis was one of the most famous of the bishops of his time. He was at
            the council of Nicea, and so was Ethilhas or Ethalaha of Edessa. </p>
        <p> 20. Constantius is said to have built Tela, but probably he restored or enlarged it, and
            called it Constantina. Dionysius refers this restoration to Constantine. Assemani says
            the new name was Constantina, and not Constantinople, as Dionysius affirms. </p>
        <p> 21. Chidon was not far from Edessa. </p>
        <p> 22. This happened in consequence of an earthquake, at the very time a council was being
            held in the city. The bishops removed to Seleucia, in Isauria, and finished their
            business there. </p>
        <p> 25. Barses seems to have been translated from Haran to Edessa simply by the command of
            the emperor. </p>
        <p> 29. The great baptistery may have stood where Mr. Badger says a mosque now
            stands,----"The mosque called Oloor Jamesi was an old Christian church, as is evident
            from the hexangular belfry which is now converted into a minaret, and from the lower
            parts of the building. As in the case of the Great Mosque at Diarbekir, the nave of the
            church has been turned into a court-yard, in which a fountain has been introduced for
            the religious ablutions of the Mussulmans; and the southern wall of the church is now
            the northern wall of the mosque. The fountain is surmounted by a dome raised upon four
            Corinthian pillars taken from some more ancient building." (Nestorians, i., 326). May
            not the fountain be really of ancient origin? </p>
        <p> 30. The grave of Ephraim, or rather his tomb in a cave, is still shewn at Urfah, and
            upon it the Jacobites consecrate the Eucharistic elements. </p>
        <p> 33. Certainly not in the same year as the death of Barses. It is not clear when these
            years begin. They are usually supposed to begin Sept. 1, but our author seems to have
            some other day, as several of his entries suggest. Above in No. 31 he reckons September,
            as in the same year with the preceding June. Assemani says this belongs to the year 690. </p>
        <p> 34. Mar Demet is rendered by Assemani as if it were a contraction of Domitius, "<i>Domus
                Mar Domitii.</i>" He prints it in italics, apparently as if in doubt. The vowels are
            as we give them, and therefore we prefer to think <i>Demetrius </i>is meant, both here
            and elsewhere (<i>B. O., </i>i., 215). </p>
        <p> 35. Resaina signifies Fountain-head, and was restored by Theodosius. <a name="p42"><span
                    class="pb">|42</span></a>#nbsp# </p>
        <p> 36. The second general council in A.D. 381. It began in October, hence the author
            assigns it to 693, and not 692; Assemani at least puts it in October, with which however
            others do not agree. Socrates assigns it to May; and the very ancient MS. quoted in
                <i>Syriac Miscellanies </i>(A.D. 500) refers it to August. So also the Syriac
            Chronicle quoted, in <i>Syriac Miscellanies, </i>p. 89. Eulogius of Edessa attended the
            council. </p>
        <p> 37. Eulogius died on Good Friday. </p>
        <p> 38. It does not appear where they obtained the relics of the Apostle. They were,
            however, deposited in "his great temple," <i>i.e., </i>a church dedicated to his name,
            or called after him. </p>
        <p> 40. This invasion of the Huns or Asiatic Tartars (A.D. 395) was probably the first in
            that direction; it was not the last. </p>
        <p> 47. The Madrashé of Absamia may have been poems, but the word is also used of prose.
            Assemani says "<i>odas </i>et sermones composuit." </p>
        <p> 48. Who was Barlaha, "the son of God?" A writer of the name copied Ephraim's works in
            A.D. 551, and is spoken of by Assemani as an "egregius scriptor." <i>B. O. </i>i., 83. </p>
        <p> 49. The Syriac text has the word <i>neomenia.</i>
        </p>
        <p> 51. This adaptation of a Jewish synagogue for Christian worship at the emperor's
            bidding, was probably an act of spoliation perpetrated upon the Jews. </p>
        <p> 53. The Eutychian heresy began later than A.D. 421, and probably later than 431 by a few
            years at least. Eutyches affirmed that there was but one nature in Christ, and there are
            many Monophysites to this day. </p>
        <p> 54. Possibly Jacob the "mutilated," had misunderstood and misapplied Matthew xix. 12.
            Jacob was, however, doubtless a real martyr; as he was certainly a famous one. </p>
        <p> 55. Assemani understands this to allude to the heresy of Theodore of Mopsuestia, and
            thinks the writer favoured him and Pelagius, from the form in which he puts the record.
            The orthodox held that "sin was implanted in nature;" it was the heterodox who
            maintained that it was not. The scribe then makes the orthodox the heretics. </p>
        <p> 57. A shower of dust at Edessa must have been a rare event. </p>
        <p> 58. For 742 the MS. had 744, which Assemani corrected. </p>
        <p> 60. The weight of the table offered by Senator is put down at 720 <i>litra, </i>the same
            as the Latin <i>libra, </i>a pound of about twelve ounces avoirdupois. This would make
            about 540 lbs. avoirdupois. </p>
        <p> 61. In the Syriac we read that Anatol the <i>Stratelates </i>made a <i>nauso </i>of
            silver. The name Anatol is, of course, a shortened form of Anatolius,----proper names
            are frequently abbreviated in <a name="p43"><span class="pb">|43</span></a> this
            chronicle, but we have not always indicated the fact. The <i>Nauso </i>seems to be a
            mere variation of <i>Naos, </i>a temple or shrine. Christianity was now looking up the
            trappings of exploded idolatry. The reader will be reminded of the silver shrines of
            Artemis in Acts xix. 24, where the Greek has this very word, and so has the Syriac
            Peshito. The other word Stratelates,= <font face="SPIonic">
                strathla&amp;thj</font>,<i> </i>a commander of soldiers, is as old as Sophocles and
            Euripides. </p>
        <p> 63. The second synod of Ephesus, says Assemani, was held, not in 756, but in 760, or
            A.D. 449. Although Ibas of Edessa was anathematised on that occasion, the fact is
            recorded without a remark. The bishop, we are told in the following article, left Edessa
            on January 1st, 759; if, however, the synod was held in 760, the bishop could not have
            been removed till the next year. Nounus, called Nono in the Syriac text, "made a
                <i>hierateion </i>in the church." A "<i>hierateion</i>" is a "locus sacer ac
            venerandus, tabulate inclusus, clericis tantum, viris saecularibus raro, mulieribus
            nunquam penetrabilis." </p>
        <p> 65. This reference to a "bishop <i>in </i>Rome" (as the Syriac has it), is the first and
            only indication given by the chronicle that there were bishops there at all. From first
            to last there is no sign of dependence upon Rome, or of any connection with it. </p>
        <p> 67. Mar Isaac is called an Archimandrite by Assemani, but the Syriac is "head of a
            convent," or monastery,----the Greek word is not used. </p>
        <p> 68. Ibas was restored and Nonnus removed; but when Ibas died Nonnus resumed episcopal
            functions. Nonnus was no doubt a zealous churchman, for he not only made a sacristy in
            the church, he built the Church of John the Baptist, etc. As Assemani renders it, he
            also built a "nosocomium pauperum invalidorum extra portam Beth-Semes." The Syriac is
            here peculiar, and might be rendered "the field of the house of poor invalids."
            Michaelis says "videtur significare hortos, subdio sed porticibus cinctos, in quibus
            obambulari aegroti poterant." Within this inclosure Nonnus built a church. His
            philanthropy and religious zeal further appear in his erection of convents, towers and
            bridges, and in the improvement of the highways. These things certainly indicate wealth,
            influence and public spirit. </p>
        <p> 69. The death of this famous enthusiast, whom Assemani calls "Sanctissimum Stylitam," is
            said to have happened in the year 770, or A.D. 459. So the Chronicle quoted in <i>Syriac
                Miscellanies </i>(p. 83), "In 730 Mar Simeon ascended the pillar, and in 770 he died
            on the 2nd of Elul." </p>
        <p> 74. All artificers were required to pay a tax of one <i>Aureus</i>
            <a name="p44"><span class="pb">|44</span></a> every fourth year. The taxes levied are
            enumerated in the extracts given by Assemani (<i>B. O., </i>i., 268), and are very
            curious, including horses, oxen, mules, asses, dogs, beggars, and dunghills. </p>
        <p> 76. The <i>Syncelli </i>were the personal attendants and assistants of the bishop.
            Assemani overlooks in his translation the clause about the sign which appeared in the
            sky, and which was probably a comet. </p>
        <p> 79. The great fire in the north was no doubt the <i>aurora borealis. </i>From this
            record we should infer that it is seldom seen in those parts. </p>
        <p> 82. The sabbath of the resurrection is, of course, the day before Easter Sunday. In the
            tables of lessons appended by Widmanstadt to his Syriac Testament, the day after Good
            Friday is called the "sabbath of the annunciation." </p>
        <p> 83. The receptacle in question was probably the shrine of St. Euphemia. According to
            Theophanes, the book was laid up in the altar, and was actually conveyed to the emperor.
            The miracle was of course an after-thought. </p>
        <p> 87. To this item Assemani appends the words "<i>exilio mulctavit," </i>probably because
            he supposed this implied by the previous verb. </p>
        <p> 89. This Paul was Bishop of Edessa twice. The Syrians call him an "interpreter of
            books," either because he translated out of Greek into Syriac, or because he wrote
            expositions of Scripture. Respecting him Assemani gives an interesting extract from John
            of Asia (or of Ephesus) preserved by Dionysius in his Chronicle. The baptistery alluded
            to in the text is probably the one mentioned above, number 29. </p>
        <p> 90. For "December" Assemani has "October" by mistake. Who were the <i>oriental </i>monks
            so summarily ejected? They were monophysites, but how came they to be styled "orientals"
            at Edessa? </p>
        <p> 92. The remains of Asclepius were exhumed and transferred to Edessa to be buried in the
            Church of St. Barlaha, <i>upon </i>or <i>beside </i>those of Nonnus. </p>
        <p> 97. Ephraim of Amida is called "<i>Comes Orientis</i>," a dignity which he appears not
            to have retained, although Assemani passes over the verbs which we translate "had been." </p>
        <p> 101. The Huns who thus come upon the scene, it is needless to say, were Asiatic Tartars. </p>
        <p> 102. Rufinus is called "patricius" or the patrician, a name borne by the presidents or
            prefects of Edessa. (See Nos. 89, 93.) </p>
        <p> 104. The word "indiction" occurs in the text. This mode of reckoning is often given in
            old Syriac writers. Procopius <a name="p45"><span class="pb">|45</span></a> says that a
            comet appeared in the thirteenth of Justinian, and hence Assemani infers that for 850 we
            should read 851 in the text. </p>
        <p> 105. Shura or Sura is mentioned by Procopius, <i>De Aedific. Justin, </i>ii. 9. See
            Martiniere <i>sub voc. </i>Surum. D'Anville places it on the Euphrates, and with others
            calls it Sura. Procopius terms it <font face="SPIonic">Surwn polisma</font> ----the town
            of Suron. The Syriac word means usually "a wall." Instead of two hundred pounds of gold,
            or, as the Syriac text has it, "two centenaria of gold," Assemani writes "<i>duobus auri
                pondo," </i>but surely "pondo" does not equal "centenaria;" probably we should read
                <i>"ducentis </i>auri pondo." </p>
        <p> 106. This Chronicle is followed in Assemani by a list of the kings of Edessa, and a list
            of its bishops from A.D. 313 to 769. We may note that the Chronicle mentions no Bishop
            of Edessa before Conon, "who laid the foundation of the Church of Edessa" in A.D. 313.
            But we must not misinterpret this indication. There had long been Christians in Edessa,
            as authentic records prove. Not only so, this very Chronicle, in recording the overthrow
            of the city by water in 513 (A.D. 202), mentions the destruction of the "temple of the
            church of the Christians." This remarkable phrase shews not only that the disciples had
            a house of worship then, but that it was called a temple. More than this, the Christian
            community seems to monopolize the word Church, which was not yet applied to the building
            in which they assembled. Assemani observes that the words under notice shew that the
            Archivists were still heathen, although the king was a Christian, as Eusebius notes from
            Africanus (in Chron). Conon, above-named, refounded the church at Edessa, and hoped to
            rebuild it, but this work was accomplished by his successor. It can hardly be supposed
            that the reference is to the restoration of the "temple" destroyed in A.D. 202; it is
            rather to what is called "the old church" in number 60; restored by Justinian with
            immense splendour.---- (Vid. Bayer, p. 250). </p>

            have put "An." where the text has "the year," or "in the year;" and we have not always
            explained the month. The year A.D. may of course be ascertained by deducting 311; care
            being taken to remember that the years properly commence in September. Hence Haziran 636
            is A.D. 325; but so is Canun the former 637. Therefore, when an occurrence falls in the
            first eight months of the year we must deduct 311 to reduce it to A.D.; but when an
            event belongs to the four last months we must deduct 312. There are irregularities, but
            the year properly began on the Calends of September. For the benefit of some readers we
            append the months which generally correspond. At present the Persian Nestorians follow
            the old style, like the Russians, but we may regard the ancient months as agreeing with
            the Roman:---- </p>
