         <salute><persName>Ignatius</persName> who is [also called] <persName>Theophorus</persName>, to the church which has received grace
            through the greatness of the Father Most High; to her who presideth in the place of the
            region of the Romans, who is worthy of God, and worthy of life, and happiness, and
            praise, and remembrance, and is worthy of prosperity, and presideth in love, and is
            perfected in the law of <persName>Christ</persName> unblameable: [wishes] abundance of peace.</salute>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <head>Chapter 1</head>
            <p>From of old have I prayed to God, that I might be counted worthy to behold your faces
               which are worthy of God: now, therefore, being bound in <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, I hope to meet
               you and salute you, if it be the will [of God] that I should be accounted worthy to
               the end. For the beginning is well arranged, if I be counted worthy to attain to the
               end, that I may receive my portion, without hindrance, through suffering. For I am in
               fear of your love, lest it should injure me. As to you, indeed, it is easy for you to
               do whatsoever ye wish; but as to me, it is difficult for me to be accounted worthy of
               God, if indeed ye spare me not.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">
            <head>Chapter 2</head>
            <p>For there is no other time such as this, that I should be accounted worthy of God;
               neither will ye, if ye be silent, ​[ever] be found in a better work than this. If ye
               let me alone, I shall be the word of God; but if ye love my flesh, again am I [only]
               to myself a voice. Ye cannot give me anything more precious than this, that I should
               be sacrificed to God, while the altar is ready; that ye may be in one concord in
               love, and may praise God the Father through <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> our Lord, because He has
               deemed a bishop worthy to be God's, having called him from the east to the west. It
               is good that I should set from the world in God, that I may rise in Him to
               life.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/></p>

            <head>Chapter 3</head>
            <p>Ye have never envied any man. Ye have taught others. Only pray ye for strength to be
               given to me from within and from without, that I may not only speak, but also may be
               willing, and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but also may be found to be
               [one]; for if I am found to be [so], I may then also be called [so]. Then [indeed]
               shall I be faithful, when I am no longer seen in the world. For there is nothing
               visible that is good. The work is not [a matter<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/>] of persuasion; but Christianity
               is great when the world hateth it.</p>

         <div type="section" n="4">
            <head>Chapter 4</head>
            <p>I write to all the churches, and declare to all men, that I willingly die for the
               sake of God, if so be that ye hinder me not. I entreat of you not to be [affected]
               towards me with a love which is unseasonable. Leave me to become [the prey of] the
               beasts, that by their means I may be accounted worthy of God. I am the wheat of God,
               and by the teeth of the beasts I shall be ground,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> that I may be found the pure
               bread of God. Provoke ye greatly<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> the wild beasts, that they may ​be for me a
               grave, and may leave nothing of my body, in order that, when I have fallen asleep, I
               may not be a burden upon any one. Then shall I be in truth a disciple of <persName>Jesus
               Christ</persName>, when the world seeth not even my body. Entreat of our Lord in my behalf, that
               through these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God. I do not, like <persName>Peter</persName> and
               <persName>Paul</persName>, issue orders unto you. They are<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> apostles, but I am one condemned; they
               indeed are free, but I am a slave, even until now. But if I suffer, I shall be the
               freed-man of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, and I shall rise in Him from the dead, free. And now being
               in bonds, I learn to desire nothing.</p>

            <p>From <placeName>Syria</placeName>, and even unto <placeName>Rome</placeName>, I am cast among wild beasts, by sea and by land, by
               night and by day, being bound between ten leopards, which are the band of soldiers,
               who, even when I do good to them, all the more do evil unto me. I, however, am the
               rather instructed by their injurious treatment;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> but not on this account am I
               justified to myself. I rejoice in the beasts which are prepared for me, and I pray
               that they may in haste be found for me; and I will provoke them speedily to devour
               me, and not be as those which are afraid of some other men,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> and will not approach
               them: even should they not be willing to approach me, I will go with violence against
               them. Know me from myself what is expedient for me.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> Let no one<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> envy me of
               those things ​which are seen and which are not seen, that I should be accounted
               worthy of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>. Fire, and the cross, and the beasts that are prepared,
               cutting off of the limbs, and scattering of the bones, and crushing of the whole
               body, harsh torments of the devil—let these come upon me, but<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> only let me be
               accounted worthy of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>.</p>

            <p>And my love is crucified, and there is no fire in me for another love. I do not
               desire the food of corruption, neither the lusts of this world. I seek the bread of
               God, which is the flesh of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>; and I seek His blood, a drink which is love

               <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>; for those also who were near to [my] way in the flesh, preceded me in

            <p><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/>[Now therefore, being about to arrive shortly in <placeName>Rome</placeName>, I ​know many things in
               God; but I keep myself within measure, that I may not perish through boasting: for
               now it is needful for me to fear the more, and not pay regard to those who puff me
               up. For they who say such things to me scourge me; for I desire to suffer, but I do
               not know if I am worthy. For zeal is not visible to many, but with me it has war. I
               have need, therefore, of meekness, by which the prince of this world is destroyed. I
               am able to write to you of heavenly things, but I fear lest I should do you an
               injury. Know me from myself. For I am cautious lest ye should not be able to receive
               [such knowledge], and should be perplexed. For even I, not because I am in bonds, and
               am able to know heavenly things, and the places of angels, and the stations of the
               powers that are seen and that are not seen, am on this account a disciple; for I am
               far short of the perfection which is worthy of God.] Be ye perfectly strong<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> in
