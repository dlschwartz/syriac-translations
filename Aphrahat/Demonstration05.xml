            <p> This reflection has befallen me at this time concerning the shaking that is to take
               place at this time, and the host that has assembled itself for the sword. The times
               were disposed beforehand by God. The times of peace are fulfilled in the days of the
               good and just; and the times of many evils are fulfilled in the days of the evil and
               transgressors. For it is thus written:–Good must happen and blessed is he through
               whom it shall come to pass; and evil must happen, but woe to him through whom it
               shall come to pass.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> Good has come to the people of God, and blessedness awaits
               that man through whom the good came. And evil is stirred up as regards the host that
               is gathered together by means of the evil and arrogant one who glories; and woe also
               is there reserved for him through whom the evil is stirred up. But do not, my
               beloved, reproach the evil person who has inflicted evil upon many; because the times
               were beforehand disposed and the time of their accomplishment has arrived. </p>

            <p> Therefore because it is the time of the Evil One, hear in mystery that which I am
               writing for thee. For thus it is written:–Whatsoever is exalted amongst men is
               despicable before God.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> And again it is written:–Everyone who exalteth himself
               shall be abased, and everyone who humbleth himself shall be exalted.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> Also Jeremiah
               said:–Let not the mighty glory in his might, nor the rich in his riches.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> And again
               the blessed Apostle said:–Whosoever glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> And David
               said:–I saw the wicked exalted and lifted up as the cedar of Lebanon; and when I
               passed by he was not, and I sought him and found him not.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> </p>

            <p> For every one that glories shall be humbled. Cain gloried over Abel his brother and
               slew him. And he was cursed and became a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. Again
               the Sodomites gloried over Lot, and there fell upon them fire from heaven and burned
               them up and their city was overthrown upon them. And Esau gloried over Jacob and
               persecuted him, and Jacob received the birthright and blessings of Esau. And the
               children of Jacob gloried over Joseph, and (afterwards) fell down and worshipped him
               in Egypt. And Pharaoh gloried over Moses and over his people; and Pharaoh and his
               host were drowned in the sea. And Dathan and Abiram gloried over Moses, and they went
               down alive to Sheol. And Goliath threatened David, and he fell before him and was
               crushed. And again Saul persecuted David, and he fell by the sword of the
               Philistines. And Absalom exalted himself against him, and Joab slew him in the
               battle. Again Benhadad gloried over Ahab, and he was delivered into the hand of
               Israel. And Sennacherib blasphemed against Hezekiah and his God, and his host became
               dead carcases when one of the Watchers went forth and slew in the camp one hundred
               and eighty-five thousand at the prayer of Hezekiah and at the prayer of Prophet
               Isaiah, most glorious of the Prophets. Ahab exalted himself over Micah, and he went
               up and fell in Ramoth Gilead. Jezebel gloried over Elijah, and the dogs devoured her
               in the portion of Jezreel. Haman gloried over Mordecai, and his iniquity turned back
               upon his own head. The Babylonians gloried over Daniel and cast him into the den of
               lions, and Daniel came up victorious, and they were cast instead of him into the den.
               Again the Babylonians gloried and accused Hananiah and his companions, and they were
               cast into the furnace of fire; and they came up victorious and the flame devoured the
               accusers. </p>

            <p> Now Nebuchadnezzar said:–I will ascend to heaven and exalt my throne above the stars
               of God and sit in the lofty mountains that are in the borders of the North.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> Isaiah
               said concerning him:–Because thy heart has thus exalted thee, therefore thou shalt be
               brought down to Sheol, and all that look upon thee shall be astonished at thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/>
               And Sennacherib also said thus:–I will go up to the summit of the mountains and to
               the shoulders of Lebanon.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> I will dig and drink water and will dry up with my
               horses’ hoofs all the deep rivers. And because he thus exalted himself, Isaiah again
               said concerning him:–Why does the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it,
               or the saw exalt itself against him that saweth with it, or the rod lift itself up
               against him that wieldeth it?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> For thou, Sennacherib, art the axe in the hands of
               Him that cuts, and thou art the saw in the hands of Him that saws, and the rod in the
               hand of Him that wields thee for chastisement, and thou art the staff for smiting.
               Thou art sent against the fickle people, and again thou art ordained against the
               stubborn people, that thou mayest carry away the captivity and take the spoil; and
               thou hast made them as the mire of the streets for all men and for all the Gentiles.
               And when thou hast done all these things, why art thou exalted against Him Who holds
               thee, and why dost thou boast against Him Who saws with thee, and why hast thou
               reviled the holy city? and hast said to the children of Jerusalem:–Can your God
               deliver you from my hand?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> And thou hast dared to say:–Who is the Lord that He
               shall deliver you from my hands? Because of this, hear the word of the Lord,
               saying:–I will crush the Assyrian in My land, and on My mountains will I tread him
               down.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> And when he shall have been crushed and trodden down, the Virgin, the
               daughter of Zion, will despise him, and the daughter of Jerusalem will shake her head
               and say:–Whom hast thou reviled and blasphemed, and against whom hast thou lifted up
               thy voice? Thou hast lifted up thine eyes towards heaven against the Holy One of
               Israel, and by the hands of thy messengers thou hast reviled the Lord. Now see that
               the hook has been forced into thy nostrils, and the bridle into thy lips, and thou
               hast turned back with thine heart crushed, who camest with thine heart uplifted.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/>
               And his slaying was by the hands of his loved ones; and in the house of his
               confidence,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> there was he overthrown, and fell before his god. And truly it was
               right, my beloved, that his body should thus become a sacrifice and offering before
               that god on whom he relied, and in his temple, as a memorial for his idol. </p>

            <p> Again the ram was lifted up and exalted, and pushed with its horns towards the west,
               and towards the north, and towards the south, and humbled many beasts. And they could
               not stand before him, until the he-goat came from the west and smote the ram and
               broke his horns and humbled the ram completely. But the ram was the King of Media and
               Persia, that is, Darius; and the he-goat was Alexander, the son of Philip, the
               Macedonian. For Daniel saw the ram when he was in the East before the gate of Shushan
               the fortress that is in the province of Elam, upon the river Ulai. And he was pushing
               towards the West and towards the North and towards the South. And none of the beasts
               could stand before him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> And the he-goat of the goats came up from the region of
               the Greeks, and exalted himself against the ram. And he smote him and broke both his
               horns, the greater and the lesser. And why did he say that he broke both his horns?
               Clearly because he humbled both the kingdoms which he ruled; the lesser, that of the
               Medes, and the greater, that of the Persians. But when Alexander the Greek came, he
               slew Darius, King of Media and Persia. For thus the angel said to Daniel, when he was
               explaining the vision to him:–The ram that thou sawest was the King of Media and
               Persia, and the he-goat the King of the Greeks.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> Now, from the time that the two
               horns of the ram were broken, until this time, there have been six hundred and
               forty-eight years.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> </p>

         <div type="section" n="6">

            <p> Therefore, as for the ram, its horns are broken. And though its horns are broken,
               lo! it exalts and uplifts itself against the fourth beast, that is strong and mighty
               and its teeth of iron and its hoofs of brass, and it shall devour and grind down, and
               trample with its feet whatsoever remaineth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> O Ram, whose horns are broken, rest
               thou from the beast, and provoke it not lest it devour thee and grind thee to powder.
               The ram could not stand before the he-goat; how shall it stand before that terrible
               beast, whose mouth speaketh great things,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> and whatsoever it finds it couches over
               as a lion over his prey? Whoever provokes the lion becomes its portion; and whoever
               stirs up that beast, it shall devour him. And who is there that shall escape out from
               under the feet of that beast when it is trampling on him? For the beast shall not be
               slain until the Ancient of Days shall sit upon the throne, and the Son of Man shall
               come near before Him, and authority shall be given to Him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> Then shall that beast
               be slain and its carcase shall perish. And the Kingdom of the Son of Man shall be
               established, an eternal Kingdom, and His authority from generation to generation.

            <p> Be quiet, O thou that dost exalt thyself; vaunt not thyself! For if thy wealth has
               lifted up thy heart, it is not more abundant than that of Hezekiah, who went in and
               boasted of it before the Babylonians, (yet) it was all of it carried away and went to
               Babylon. And if thou gloriest in thy children, they shall be led away from thee to
               the Beast, as the children of King Hezekiah were led away, and became eunuchs in the
               palace of the King of Babylon.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> And if thou dost glory in thy wisdom, thou dost
               not in it excel the Prince of Tyre, whom Ezekiel reproached, saying unto him:–Art
               thou wiser than Daniel, or hast thou seen by thy wisdom the things that are hid?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/>
               And if thy mind is puffed up by thy years, that they are many; they are not more in
               number than those of the Prince of Tyre who ruled the Kingdom during the days of
               twenty-two Kings of the house of Judah, that is, for four hundred and forty years.
               And since the years of that King of Tyre were many, all the time he thus said in his
               heart, I am God and sit in the seat of God in the heart of the seas.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> But Ezekiel
               said to him: Thou art a man and thou art not God. For while the Prince of Tyre was
               walking without fault in the midst of the stones of fire, there was mercy upon him.
               But when his heart was lifted up, the cherub who overshadoweth, destroyed him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/>

            <p> Now, what are the stones of fire, but the children of Zion and the children of
               Jerusalem? For in the ancient time, in the days of David and of Solomon his son,
               Hiram was a friend to those of the house of Israel. But when they were carried away
               captive from their place, he rejoiced over them and spurned them with his feet, and
               did not remember the friendship of the house of David. And as to that which I said
               that the children of Judah were called the stones of fire, it was not of my own
               thought that I said it, but Jeremiah the Prophet spake concerning them; for when he
               was calling forth tears for them in the Lamentations, he said:–The children of Zion
               were more excellent than precious stones.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> And again he said:–How are the stones
               of the Sanctuary cast down at the head of all the streets?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> And again He said by
               the Prophet:–The stones were holy that were cast down in his land.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> And as to
               these very stones, the fire was burning in them, as Jeremiah said:–The word of the
               Lord became in my heart like burning fire and it was hot in my bones.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> And again
               He said to Jeremiah:–Lo! I give My word in thy mouth as fire, and this people shall
               be as wood.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> And again He said words shall go forth as fire, and as iron that
               cutteth the stone.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/> On this account the Prophets, amongst whom Hiram the Prince of
               Tyre was walking, were called stones of fire. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <head type="editorial">9</head>
            <p> And again (God) said to him:–Thou wast with the Cherub who was anointed and
               overshadowing.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> For the king, who was anointed with the holy oil, was called a
               Cherub. And he was overshadowing all his people, as Jeremiah said:–The anointed of
               the Lord is the breath of our nostrils, he of whom we said that in his shadow shall
               we live amongst the Gentiles.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/> For they were sitting in the shadow of the king,
               while he was standing at their head. And when the crown of their head fell, they were
               without shade. And if any one should say that this word is spoken concerning Christ,
               let him receive that which I write for him without disputation, and thus he will be
               persuaded that it was said with reference to the king. For Jeremiah said in behalf of
               the people:–Woe unto us, for the crown of our head has fallen!<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> But Christ has not
               fallen, because He rose again the third day. For the king fell from the house of
               Judah, and never again was their kingdom set up. And as for that He said again:–I
               will destroy the overshadowing Cherub.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/> For the Cherub that He will destroy is
               Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written:–He performed a work in Tyre, and there was given
               him by Tyre no hire for his host, and in return for the work of Tyre there was given
               him the land of Egypt.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/> And why was hire not given by Tyre to Nebuchadnezzar?
               Clearly because its wealth went away in the sea, so that Nebuchadnezzar did not
               receive it. And at that time He destroyed the overshadowing Cherub, which is
               Nebuchadnezzar. For there are two Cherubs, one anointed and overshadowing, and one
               overshadowing but not anointed. For He said above:–Thou wast with the Cherub anointed
               and overshadowing.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n36"/> And lower down He said:–I will destroy thee the overshadowing
               Cherub;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/> and did not say “anointed.” For Nebuchadnezzar was not anointed; but
               David and Solomon were, and the other kings who arose after them. And how was
               Nebuchadnezzar called overshadowing? Clearly on account of the vision of the tree,
               when he saw a tree in the midst of the earth, beneath which dwelt all the beasts of
               the wilderness and on its branches dwelt all the birds of heaven, and from it all
               flesh was fed. When Daniel interpreted his dream to him, Daniel said to him:–Thou art
               the tree, that tree which thou sawest in the midst of the earth and beneath thee
               dwell all the nations.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n38"/> On this account he was the overshadowing Cherub; who
               destroyed the Prince of Tyre, because he rejoiced over the children of Israel, for
               that they were carried away captive from their land, and because his heart was
               exalted. This Tyre also lay waste seventy years like Jerusalem which sat in
               desolation seventy years. For Isaiah said concerning it:–Tyre shall wander seventy
               years, as the days of one king, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms
               that are upon the face of the earth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39"/> </p>

         <div type="section" n="10">
            <head type="editorial">10</head>
            <p>O thou that art exalted and lifted up, let not the vaunting of thine heart mislead
               thee, nor say thou, I will go up against the rich land and against the powerful
               beast. For that beast will not be slain by the ram seeing that its horns are broken.
               For the he-goat broke the horns of the ram.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40"/> Now the he-goat has become the mighty
               beast. For when the children of Japhet held the kingdom, then they slew Darius, the
               king of Persia. Now the fourth beast has swallowed up the third. And this third
               consists of the children of Japhet, and the fourth consists of the children of Shem,
               for they are the children of Esau. Because, when Daniel saw the vision of the four
               beasts, he saw first the children of Ham, the seed of Nimrod, which the Babylonians
               are; and secondly, the Persians and Medes, who are the children of Japhet; and
               thirdly, the Greeks, the brethren of the Medes; and fourthly, the children of Shem,
               which the children of Esau are. For a confederacy was formed between the children of
               Japhet and the children of Shem. Then the government was taken away from the children
               of Japhet, the younger, and was given to Shem, the elder; and to this day it
               continues, and will continue for ever. But when the time of the consummation of the
               dominion of the children of Shem shall have come, the Ruler, who came forth from the
               children of Judah, shall receive the kingdom, when He shall come in His second
               Advent.</p>

         <div type="section" n="11">
            <head type="editorial">11</head>
            <p> For in the vision of Nebuchadnezzar, when he saw it, which Daniel made known and
               showed to Nebuchadnezzar, when he saw the image which stood over against him, the
               head of the image was of gold, and its breast and arms of silver, and its belly and
               thighs of brass, and its legs and feet of iron and potter’s clay.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41"/> And Daniel said
               to Nebuchadnezzar:–Thou art the head of gold.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42"/> And why was he called the head of
               gold? Was it not because the word of Jeremiah was fulfilled in him? For Jeremiah
               said:–Babylon is a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, that makes all the earth to
               drink of its wine.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43"/> And also Babylon was called the head of all the kingdoms, as
               it is written:–Babylon was the head of the of Nimrod.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <head type="editorial">12</head>
            <p> And he said that the breast and the arms of the image were of silver. This signified
               concerning a kingdom which was inferior to it; namely, Darius the Mede. For (God) put
               the kingdom into the balance. For the kingdom of the house of Nimrod was weighed and
               was found wanting. And since it was wanting, Darius received it. Because of this he
               said that his kingdom was inferior.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n45"/> And because it was inferior, the children of
               Media did not rule in all the earth. Now the belly and thighs of the image were of
               brass, and he said:–The third kingdom shall rule in all the earth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n46"/> It is the
               kingdom of the children of Javan, who are children of Japhet. For the children of
               Javan came in against the kingdom of their brethren. For Madai and Javan are sons of
               Japhet.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n47"/> But Madai was foolish and incapable of governing the kingdom, until
               Javan, his brother came, who was wise and cunning, to destroy the kingdom. For
               Alexander, son of Philip, ruled in all the earth.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <head type="editorial">13</head>
            <p> And the legs and feet of the image were of iron. This is the kingdom of the children
               of Shem, who are the children of Esau, which is strong as iron. And he said:–As iron
               breaks and subdueth everything, so also the fourth kingdom shall break and bruise
               everything.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48"/> And he explained with reference to the feet and toes, that part of
               them was of iron and part of them of potter’s clay. For he said:–Thus they shall be
               mingled with the seed of man, and they shall not cleave one to another, as iron
               cannot be mixed with clay.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n49"/> This referred to the fourth kingdom. Because in the
               kingdom of the children of Esau<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n50"/> there was not a king, the son of a king,
               established to govern the kingdom; but when the children of Esau were gathered
               together into a powerful city, then they made a senate. And from thence they used to
               set up as chief of the city a wise man to govern the kingdom, lest when the Governor
               of their kingdom should weigh them, they might be found wanting, and the kingdom
               might be taken away from them as the kingdom of the children of arrogant Nimrod was
               taken away and given to the children of foolish Madai. And this king who was set up,
               the seed of that former king was destroying him; and they did not cleave one to
               another. But as to the seed of man which is compared with the clay, the meaning is
               this; that when the king was chosen for the kingdom, he mingled himself with the root
               of the kingdom of iron. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <head type="editorial">14</head>
            <p> And he showed that in the days of those kings, who shall arise in the kingdom, the
               God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall not be destroyed and shall not pass
               away for ever.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n51"/> This is the Kingdom of King Messiah, which is that which shall
               cause the fourth kingdom to pass away. And above he said:–Thou sawest a stone which
               was cut out, but not by hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and
               potter’s clay and broke them to pieces.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n52"/> Now he did not say that it smote upon the
               head of the image, nor on its breast and arms, nor yet on its belly and thighs, but
               on its feet; because that, of the whole image, that stone when it comes will find the
               feet alone. And in the next verse he said:–The iron and the brass and the silver and
               the gold were broken to pieces together.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n53"/> For after them, when King Messiah shall
               reign, then He will humble the fourth kingdom, and will break the whole image; for by
               the whole image the world is meant. Its head is Nebuchadnezzar; its breast and arms
               the King of Media and Persia; its belly and thighs the King of the Greeks; its legs
               and feet the kingdom of the children of Esau; the stone, which smote the image and
               brake it, and with which the whole earth was filled, is the kingdom of King Messiah,
               Who will bring to nought the kingdom of this world, and He will rule for ever and
               ever. </p>

            <p> Again hear concerning the vision of the four beasts which Daniel saw coming up out
               of the sea and diverse one from another. This is the appearance of them:–The first
               was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. And I saw that its wings were
               plucked away, and it stood up like a man upon its feet, and the heart of a man was
               given to it.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n54"/> And the second beast was like a bear, and it raised itself up upon
               one side and there were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And the third
               beast was like a leopard, and it had four wings and four heads. And the fourth beast
               was exceedingly terrible and strong and powerful, and it had great teeth. It devoured
               and brake to pieces, and whatsoever remained, it stamped with its feet. Now the great
               sea that Daniel saw<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55"/> is the world: and these four beasts are the four kingdoms
               signified above. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="16">
            <head type="editorial">16</head>
            <p> Now as to the first beast, he said concerning it, that it was like a lion, and it
               had the wings of an eagle. For the first beast was the kingdom of Babylon, which was
               like a lion. For thus Jeremiah wrote saying:–Israel is a wandering sheep. The lions
               caused them to wander. First the king of Assyria devoured him. And this last was
               stronger than he, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56"/> So Jeremiah called him a lion.
               And he said:–He has the wings of an eagle. For thus it is written that, when
               Nebuchadnezzar went out to the wilderness with the beasts, he grew hair like (the
               plumage) of an eagle. And he said:–I saw that its wings were plucked away and it
               stood upright upon its feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n57"/> For
               first, in the vision of the image, he was compared to gold which is more precious
               than anything which is used in the world. So in the vision of the beasts he is
               compared to a lion which excels in its might all the beasts. And again he was
               compared to an eagle which surpasses every bird. Whatsoever was written about him was
               fulfilled in him. For the Lord said concerning him:–I have placed a yoke of iron upon
               the neck of all the nations, and they shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
               And also the beasts of the desert and the birds of heaven have I given to him to
               serve him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n58"/> For since the king was like the head of gold, men served him as a
               king. And when he went out to the wilderness, the beasts served him as a lion. And
               when his hair was like (the plumage) of an eagle, the birds of heaven served him as
               an eagle. But when his heart was lifted up, and he knew not that the power was given
               to him from heaven, the yoke of iron was broken from the neck of men, and he went
               forth with the beasts, and instead of the heart of a king there was given him the
               heart of a lion. And when he was lifted up over the beasts, the heart of a lion was
               taken away from him, and there was given him the heart of a bird. And when wings grew
               upon him like those of an eagle, he exalted himself over the birds. And then his
               wings also were plucked away and there was given to him a humble heart. And when he
               knew that the Most High has authority in the kingdom of man, to give it to whomsoever
               He will, then as a man he praised Him. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="17">
            <head type="editorial">17</head>
            <p> And as for the second beast, he said concerning him that it was like a bear and
               raised itself up upon one side. Because when the kingdom of Media and Persia arose,
               it arose in the east. And three ribs were in its mouth. Because the ram was pushing
               towards the West and towards the North and towards the South, towards three winds of
               heaven. These three winds it held, and pushed against, like the three ribs that were
               in the mouth of the bear; until the he-goat came forth from the west, and smote the
               ram and took out the ribs that were in his mouth. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="18">
            <head type="editorial">18</head>
            <p> And concerning the third beast he said that it was like a leopard, and it had four
               birds’ wings on its back and that beast had four heads. Now this third beast was
               Alexander the Macedonian. For he was strong as a leopard. And as for the four wings
               and the four heads that the beast had, that was because he gave the kingdom to his
               four friends to govern after him, when he had come and slain Darius and reigned in
               his stead. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="19">
            <head type="editorial">19</head>
            <p> And of the fourth beast he said that it was exceedingly terrible and strong and
               mighty, devouring and crushing and trampling with its feet anything that remained. It
               is the kingdom of the children of Esau.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n59"/> Because after that Alexander the
               Macedonian became king, the kingdom of the Greeks was founded, since Alexander also
               was one of them, even of the Greeks. But the vision of the third beast was fulfilled
               in him, since the third and the fourth were one. Now Alexander reigned for twelve
               years. And the kings of the Greeks arose after Alexander, being seventeen kings, and
               their years were two hundred and sixty-nine years from Seleucus Nicanor to Ptolemy.
               And the Cæsars were from Augustus to Philip Cæsar, seventeen kings. And their years
               are two hundred and ninety-three years;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n60"/> and eighteen years of Severus. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="20">
            <head type="editorial">20</head>
            <p> For Daniel said:–I was considering the ten horns that were upon the head of the
               beast. For the ten horns were ten kings<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n61"/> who arose at that time until Antiochus.
               And he said:–A little horn arose from between those ten and three fell before it.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n62"/>
               For when Antiochus arose in the kingdom, he humbled three kings, and he exalted
               himself against the saints of the Most High and against Jerusalem. And he defiled the
               sanctuary.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n63"/> And he caused the sacrifice and the offerings to cease for a week and
               half a week, namely, for ten and a-half years. And he brought in fornicators into the
               house of the Lord, and he caused the observances of the Law to cease.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n64"/> And he slew
               righteous men and gave them to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the earth.
               For in his days was fulfilled the word that David spoke:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n65"/>—O God, the Gentiles have
               come into thine inheritance, and have defiled Thy holy temple. They have made
               Jerusalem desolate. They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants as food to the
               birds of heaven, and the flesh of Thy righteous ones to the beasts of the earth. They
               have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there is none to
               bury them. For this was accomplished at that time, when the venerable and aged
               Eleazar was slain, and the sons of the blessed Samuna, seven in number,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n66"/> and when
               Judas (Maccabeus) and his brethren were struggling on behalf of their people, when
               they were dwelling in hiding-places.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n67"/> At that time the horn made war with the
               saints,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n68"/> and their power prevailed. And the wicked Antiochus spake words against
               the Most High, and changed the times and the seasons.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n69"/> And he made to cease the
               covenant of Abraham, and abolished the Sabbath of rest.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n70"/> For he commanded the Jews
               that they should not circumcise. Therefore, (the Prophet) said concerning him;—He
               shall think to change the times and the seasons and the laws, and they were given
               into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71"/> Now the time and half a time is
               the week and a half, which is ten years and a half. Again he said:–The judgment was
               set and they took away his authority from him, to injure and destroy him until the
               end of the kingdom.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n72"/> For the judgment came upon Antiochus, a judgment from
               heaven;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73"/> and he became sick with a grievous and evil sickness, and on account of
               the smell of him as he rotted, no man could approach him, for worms were crawling and
               falling from him and eating his flesh because he oppressed the worm Jacob.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n74"/> And
               his flesh rotted in his lifetime, because he caused the dead bodies of the sons of
               Jerusalem to rot and they were not buried. And he became defiled in his own eyes,
               because he had defiled the sanctuary of God. And he prayed and was not heard,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n75"/>
               because he did not hearken to the groanings of the righteous whom he slew. For he
               wrote a letter and sent it to the Jews and called them “my friends,” but God had not
               mercy on him, but he died in his torment. </p>

         <div type="section" n="21">

            <p> He said again:–The saints of the Most High shall receive the Kingdom.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n76"/> What shall
               we say concerning this? Have the children of Israel received the Kingdom of the Most
               High? God forbid. Or has that people come upon the clouds of heaven? This has passed
               away from them. For Jeremiah said concerning them:–Call them rejected silver, for the
               Lord has rejected them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n77"/> Again he said:–He will not again regard them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78"/> And
               Isaiah said concerning them:–Pass by; pass by; approach not the defiled.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n79"/> And
               concerning the saints of the Most High (Daniel) said thus:–They shall inherit the
               Kingdom for ever.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n80"/> For these rested a little from the burden of kings and
               princes,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n81"/> namely, from after the death of Antiochus till the sixty-two weeks were
               fulfilled. And the Son of Man came to free them and gather them together, but they
               did not receive Him. For He came to obtain fruit from them, and they did not give it
               to Him. For their vines were of the vine of Sodom and of the stock of Gomorrha, a
               vineyard<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n82"/> in which thorns grew, and which bore wild grapes.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83"/> Their vine was
               bitter, and their fruit sour. The thorns could not be softened, nor could the
               bitterness change to the nature of wine, nor could the sour fruit change to a sweet
               nature. </p>

         <div type="section" n="22">
            <head type="editorial">22</head>
            <p> For Isaiah first set men of Judah as judges over them,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84"/> and there was planted
               amongst them a new and beloved planting. But these are those judges who shall sit on
               twelve thrones and judge their twelve tribes.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85"/> And thus He said to the
               judges:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86"/>—Judge between Me and My vineyard, what further, O ye judges, should I
               have done to My vineyard, that I did not do? For lo! I planted it with vine scions,
               and they became strange vines. I surrounded it with a fence of heavenly Watchers and
               I built its tower, the holy Temple. And I dug out its winepress, the baptism of the
               priests. And I brought down rain upon it, the words of My Prophets. And I pruned it
               and trimmed it, from the works of the Amorites. I looked that it should produce
               grapes of righteousness, and it produced wild grapes of iniquity and sin. I looked
               for judgment and behold oppression, and for righteousness and there was a cry. Hear,
               O ye judges, what I will do to My vineyard. I will break open its fence, and it shall
               be for down-treading. And I will tear down its tower, and it shall be for pillage.
               And I will make it to become a desert because it produced wild grapes. And it shall
               not be dressed and it shall not be pruned. And thorns and weeds shall grow up in it.
               And I will command the clouds that they send not down rain upon it. For the heavenly
               Watchers departed from the fence of the vineyard; and the mighty tower on which they
               relied was torn down. The winepress, the cleansing away of their offences, was
               overthrown. When the vine was without blemish, it did not prove of service. Now that
               the fire has devoured it and that it is laid waste, how shall it prove of service?
               The fire has devoured its two branches and its inward parts are wasted.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87"/> For its
               two branches are the two kingdoms, and its inward part which is laid waste is
               Jerusalem. Many servants were sent to them by the Lord of the vineyard.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88"/> And they
               slew them and did not send the fruit to the Lord of the vineyard. After the servants
               the beloved Son was sent, to receive from them the fruit and to bring it back to Him
               that sent Him. And they seized Him and cast Him out of the vineyard; and they cut
               spikes from the thorns of the vineyard and fixed them in His hands. And He was hungry
               and asked food of them; and they took and gave Him gall from the fruit of the
               vineyard. He was thirsty and asked of them drink; and they gave Him vinegar and He
               would not drink it. And they platted a crown of thorns that had sprung up in the
               vineyard, and placed it on the head of the Son of the Lord of the vineyard. For from
               the time that the vineyard was made, it displayed these fruits. Therefore its Lord
               uprooted it and cast it in the fire; and planted good fruit-bearing vines in the
               vineyard, and such as gladden the husbandman. For Christ is the vineyard, and His
               Father is the husbandman; and they who drink of His cup are the vines. Therefore
               vineyard was formed instead of vineyard. And furthermore at His coming He handed over
               the kingdom to the Romans, as the children of Esau are called. And these children of
               Esau will keep the kingdom for its giver. </p>

            <p> And the holy People inherited an eternal Kingdom; the holy people who were chosen
               instead of the People. For He provoked them to jealousy with a people that was not a
               people. And with a foolish people He angered them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89"/> And He set free the holy
               people. For lo! every covenant of God is freed from the burden of kings and
               princes.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90"/> For even if a man has served the heathen, as soon as ever he draws nigh
               unto the covenant of God, he is set free. But the Jews are toiling in bondage amongst
               the Gentiles. For thus he said about the Saints;—They shall inherit the Kingdom that
               is beneath the heaven.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91"/> But if he had said it about them (the Jews), why are they
               toiling in service amongst the Gentiles? And if they say that it has not taken place
               as yet; then (we ask) is the Kingdom that shall be given to the Son of man, to be
               heavenly or earthly? And lo! the children of the Kingdom are sealed, and they have
               received their emancipation from this world. For since it exists now, it will not be
               willing to be subjected to the power of the King, Who shall come and take to Himself
               His Kingdom. But it will guard His pledges with honour, that when He shall come to
               bring to nought the Kingdom, he may come upon them not in anger. For when He, Whose
               is the Kingdom,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n92"/> shall come in His second coming, He will take to Himself whatever
               He has given. And He Himself will be King for ever and ever. And His Kingdom shall
               not pass away, because it is an eternal Kingdom. </p>

            <p> For first, He gave the Kingdom to the sons of Jacob, and subdued to them the
               children of Esau; as Isaac said to Esau:–Thou shalt serve Jacob thy brother.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n93"/> And
               when again they did not prosper in the Kingdom, He took it away from the children of
               Jacob and gave it to the children of Esau until He should come Whose it is.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n94"/> And
               they will deliver up the deposit to its Giver, and will not deal fraudulently with
               it. And the Guardian of the Kingdom is subject to Him to Whom all things are subject.
               Therefore this Kingdom of the children of Esau shall not be delivered up into the
               hand of the hosts that are gathered together, that desire to go up against it;
               because the Kingdom is being kept safe for its Giver, and He Himself will preserve
               it. And as to this that I wrote to thee, beloved, that the Kingdom of the children of
               Esau is being kept safe for its Giver, doubt not about it, that that Kingdom will not
               be conquered. For a mighty champion Whose name is Jesus shall come with power, and
               bearing as His armour all the power of the Kingdom. And search out and see that also
               by the poll-tax<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95"/> He was enrolled amongst them. And as He was enrolled by the
               poll-tax amongst them, He will also succour them. And His standard abounds in that
               place, and they are clothed in His armour, and shall not be found wanting in war. And
               if thou shouldest say unto me:–“In the years of the Kings that preceded these, why
               did they conquer and subdue the beast?” It was because the chiefs and kings who stood
               up at that time in the Kingdom of the children of Esau did not wish to lead with them
               to the war the Man who was enrolled with them in the poll-tax. Therefore the beast
               was subdued a little, but was not slain. </p>

            <p> But concerning these things that I have written for thee, my beloved, namely,
               concerning that which is written in Daniel, I have not brought them to an end, but
               (have stopped) short of the end. And if any man dispute about them, say thus to him,
               that these words are not concluded, because the words of God are infinite, nor will
               they be concluded. For the foolish man says, “Here unto (these) words reach.” And
               again, it is not possible to add to them or to diminish from them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n96"/> For the riches
               of God cannot be computed or limited. For if thou take away water from the sea, the
               deficiency will be imperceptible. And if thou remove sand from the sea-shore, its
               measure will not be diminished. And if thou count the stars of heaven, thou wilt not
               arrive at the sum of them. And if thou kindle fire from a burning, it will not a whit
               be lessened. And if thou receive of the Spirit of Christ, Christ will not a whit be
               diminished. And if Christ dwell in thee, yet He will not be completed in thee. And if
               the sun enter the windows of thy house, yet the sun in its entirety will not come to
               thee. And all these things that I have enumerated for thee were created by the word
               of God. Therefore know thou, that, as concerning the word of God no man has reached
               or will reach its end. Therefore, have thou no disputation about these things, but
               say:–“These things are so. That is enough.” But hear these things from me, and also
               enquire about them of our brethren, children of our faith. But whosoever shall mock
               at the words of his brother, even if he say, “mine are wise,” yet hearken not to his
               words. And concerning what I wrote to thee about these forces that are being stirred
               up to war, it is not as though anything has been revealed to me that I have made
               known these things to thee, but attend to the words at the head of the letter:–Every
               one who exalteth himself shall be humbled. For even if the forces shall go up and
               conquer, yet know that it is a chastisement of God; and though they conquer, they
               shall be condemned in a righteous judgment. But yet be thou assured of this, that the
               beast shall be slain at its (appointed) time. But do thou, my brother, at this time
               be earnest in imploring mercy, that there may be peace upon the people of God. </p>
