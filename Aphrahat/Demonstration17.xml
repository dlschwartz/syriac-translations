            <p> (This is) a reply against the Jews, who blaspheme the people gathered from among the
               Gentiles; for they say thus, “Ye worship and serve a man who was begotten, a son of
               man who was crucified, and ye call a son of men, God. And though God has no son, ye
               say concerning this crucified Jesus, that He is the Son of God.” And they bring
               forward as an argument, that God said:—“I am God and there is none else beside
               Me.”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> And again he said:—“Thou shalt not worship another God.”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> Therefore, (say
               they), ye are opposing God in that ye call a man, God. </p>

            <p> Concerning these things, my beloved, so far as I, in my insignificance, can
               comprehend, I will instruct thee about them, that while we grant to them that He is
               man, and (while) we at the same time honour Him and call Him God and Lord, yet it is
               not in any novel fashion, that we have so called Him, nor that we have applied to Him
               a novel name, which they themselves did not employ. Yet it is a sure thing with us,
               that Jesus our Lord is God, the Son of God, and the King, the King’s Son, Light of
               light, Creator and Counsellor, and Guide, and the Way, and Redeemer, and Shepherd,
               Gatherer, and the Door, and the Pearl, and the Lamp; and by many (such) names is He
               surnamed. But we shall leave aside all (the rest) of them, and prove concerning Him,
               that He Who came from God is the Son of God, and (is) God. </p>

            <p> For the venerated name of Godhead has been applied also to righteous men, and they
               have been held worthy to be called by it. And the men with whom God was well pleased,
               them He called, My sons, and My friends. When He chose Moses His friend and His
               beloved and made him chief and teacher and priest unto his people he called him God.
               For He said to him:—I have made thee a God unto Pharaoh.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> And He gave him His
               priest for a prophet, And Aaron thy brother shall speak for thee unto Pharaoh, and
               thou shalt be unto him as a God, and he shall be unto thee an interpreter.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> Thus
               not alone to the evil Pharaoh did He make Moses God, but also unto Aaron, the holy
               priest, He made Moses God. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <head type="editorial">4</head>
            <p> Again, hear concerning the title Son of God, by which we have called Him. They say
               that “though God has no son, ye make that crucified Jesus, the firstborn son of God.”
               Yet He called Israel “My first-born,” when He sent to Pharaoh through Moses and said
               to him, Israel is My first-born; I have said unto thee, let My Son go to serve Me,
               and if thou art not willing to let (him) go, lo! I will slay thy son, thy
               firstborn.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> And also through the Prophet<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> He testified concerning this, and
               reproved them and said to the people, Out of Egypt have I called My son. As I called
               them, so they went and worshipped Baal and offered incense to the graven images. And
               Isaiah said<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> concerning them, Children have I reared and brought up, and they have
               rebelled against Me. And again it is written, Ye are the children of the Lord your
               God.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> And about Solomon He said, He shall be to Me a son, and I will be to him a
               Father.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> So also we call the Christ, the Son of God, for through Him we have gained
               the knowledge of God; even as He called Israel My firstborn son, and as He said
               concerning Solomon, He shall be to Me a son. And we call Him God, even as He surnamed
               Moses by His own Name. And also David said concerning them:—Ye are Gods and children
               of the Highest, all of you.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> And when they amended not themselves, therefore He
               said concerning them:—As men shall ye die, and as one of the princes shall ye
               fall.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <head type="editorial">5</head>
            <p> For the name of Divinity is given for the highest honour in the world, and with
               whomsoever God is well pleased, He applies it to him. But however, the names of God
               are many and are venerable, as He delivered His names to Moses, saying to him:—I am
               the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of
               Jacob. This is My Name for ever, and this is My memorial unto generations.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> And He
               called His name Ahiyah ashar Ahiyah, El Shaddai and Adonai Sabaoth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> By these
               names is God called. The great and honourable name of Godhead He withheld not from
               His righteous ones; even as, though He is the great King, without grudging He applied
               the great and honourable name of Kingship to men who are His creatures. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <head type="editorial">6</head>
            <p> For by the mouth of His prophet God called the heathen King Nebuchadnezzar, King of
               Kings. For Jeremiah said:—Every people and kingdom that shall not put his neck into
               the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Kings, My servant, with famine and with sword and
               with pestilence will I visit that people.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> Though He is the great King, He grudges
               not the name of Kingship to men. And (so), though He is the great God, yet He grudged
               not the name of Godhead to the sons of flesh. And though all fatherhood is His, He
               has called men also fathers. For He said to the congregation:—Instead of thy fathers,
               shall be thy children.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> And though authority is His, He has given men authority
               one over another. And while worship is His unto honour, He has yet allowed it in the
               world, that one man should honour another. For even though a man should do
               worship<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> before the wicked and the heathen and them that refuse grace, yet is he
               not censured by God. And concerning worship He commanded His people, Thou shalt not
               worship the sun or the moon or all the hosts of heaven; and also ye shall not desire
               to worship any creature that is upon the earth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> Behold the grace and the love of
               our good Maker, that He did not grudge to men the name of Godhead and the name of
               worship, and the name of Kingship, and the name of authority; because He is the
               Father of the created things that are over the face of the world, and He has honoured
               and exalted and glorified men above all creatures. For with His holy hands He
               fashioned them; and of His Spirit He breathed into them, and a dwelling-place did He
               become unto them from of old.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> In them doth He abide and amongst them doth He
               walk. For He said through the prophet, I will dwell in them, and walk in them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/>
               Furthermore also the Prophet Jeremiah said:—Ye are the temple of the Lord, if ye make
               fair your ways and your deeds.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> And of old David said:—Thou, Lord, hast been a
               dwelling-place unto us for generations; before the mountains were conceived and
               before the earth travailed, and before the world was framed; from age to age Thou art
               God.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <head type="editorial">7</head>
            <p> How dost thou understand this? For one prophet says:—Lord, Thou hast been our
               dwelling-place. And another said:—I will dwell in them and walk in them. First, He
               became to us a dwelling-place, and afterwards He dwelt and walked in us. For the wise
               both things are true and simple. For David says:—Thou, Lord, hast been our
               dwelling-place for generations, before the mountains were conceived and before the
               earth travailed, and before the world was framed. And thou knowest, my beloved, that
               all created things that are above and that are beneath were created first, and after
               them all, man. For when God determined to create the world with all its goodly
               things, first He conceived and fashioned man in His mind; and after that Adam was
               conceived in His thought, then He conceived the created things; as he said:—Before
               the mountains were conceived and the earth travailed; because man is older and more
               ancient in conception than the creatures, but in birth the creatures are older and
               more ancient than Adam. Adam was conceived and dwelt in the thought of God; and while
               in conception he (man) was held in His (God’s) mind, He (God) by the word of His
               mouth created all the creatures. And when He had finished and adorned the world, when
               nothing was lacking in it, then He brought forth Adam from His thoughts, and
               fashioned man by His hands; and Adam saw the world completed. And He (God) gave him
               authority over all that He had made, just as a man who has a son and desires to make
               for him a marriage feast, betroths to him a wife and builds for him a house, and
               prepares and adorns all that is needed for his son; then he makes the marriage feast
               and gives his son authority over his house. So after the conception of Adam, He
               brought him forth and gave him authority over all his creation. Concerning this the
               Prophet said:—Thou, Lord, hast been our habitation for generations, before the
               mountains were conceived, and before the earth travailed and before the world was
               framed. From age unto age Thou art the Lord. That no one should suppose that there is
               another God, either before or afterwards, he said:—From age and unto age, just as
               Isaiah said:—I am the first and I am the last.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/> And after that God brought forth
               Adam from within His thought, He fashioned him, and breathed into him of His Spirit,
               and gave him the knowledge of discernment, that he might discern good from evil, and
               might know that God made him. And inasmuch as man knew his Maker, God was formed and
               conceived within his thought, and he became a temple for God his Maker, as it is
               written, Ye are the temple of God. And (so) He Himself said:—I will dwell in them and
               walk in them. But as for the sons of Adam, who do not recognise their Maker, He is
               not formed within them, and does not dwell in them, and is not conceived in their
               thought; but they are accounted before Him as the beasts, and as the rest of the
               creatures. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <head type="editorial">8</head>
            <p> Now by these things the stubborn will be convinced, that it is nothing strange that
               we call Christ the Son of God. For behold, He (God) conceived all men and brought
               them forth from His thoughts. And they will be forced to own that the name of Godhead
               also belongs to Him (Christ), for He (God) associated the righteous also in the name
               of God. And as to this, that we worship Jesus through Whom we have known God, let
               them be ashamed, inasmuch as they fall down and worship and honour even the heathen
               of the unclean Gentiles, if they possess authority; and (for this) there is no blame.
               And this honour of worship God has given to the sons of Adam, that by it they might
               honour one another—especially those who excel and are worthy of honour amongst them.
               For if they worship, and honour with the name of worship, the heathen—those who in
               their heathen wickedness deny even the name of God—and yet do not worship them as
               their maker, as though they worshipped them alone, and so do not sin; how much more
               does it become us to worship and honour Jesus, Who converted our stubborn minds from
               all worship of vain error, and taught us to worship and serve and minister to the one
               God, our Father and our Maker. And (taught us) to know that the kings of the world
               call themselves Gods by the name of the great God, and are infidels and force men to
               infidelity, and men fall down and worship before them and serve and honour them, like
               carven images and idols, yet the law never censured these, and there is no sin. As
               Daniel also used to do worship to Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, the infidel and
               compeller to infidelity, and was not censured. Joseph also gave worship to Pharaoh,
               and it is not written that it was a sin for him. But as for us, we are certain that
               Jesus is God, the Son of God, and through Him we know His Father, and (have) all of
               us (turned away) from all other worship. Therefore it is impossible for us to repay
               Him Who bore these things for us. But by worship let us pay Him honour in return for
               His affliction that was on our behalf. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <head type="editorial">9</head>
            <p> Furthermore, we must prove that this Jesus was beforehand promised from ancient
               times in the Prophets, and was called the Son of God. David said:—Thou art My Son;
               today have I begotten Thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> Again he said:—In the glories of holiness, from the
               womb, from of old, have I begotten thee, a child.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> And Isaiah said:—Unto us a
               child is born, unto us a Son is given, and His government was upon His shoulder, and
               His Name shall be called Wonderful, and Counsellor, and mighty God of the ages, and
               Prince of peace. And to the increase of His government and to His peace there is no
               end.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> Therefore tell me, O wise doctor of Israel, who is He that was born and
               whose name was called Child and Son and Wonderful and Counsellor, the mighty God of
               the ages, and Prince of peace, to the increase of whose government and to whose peace
               (he said), there is no end? For if we call Christ the Son of God, David taught us
               (this); and that we call Him God, this we learned from Isaiah. And His government was
               laid upon His shoulder; for He bare His cross, and went out from Jerusalem. And that
               He was born as a child, Isaiah again said:—Lo, the virgin shall conceive and bear;
               and His name shall be called Immanuel, which is, our God with us.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <head type="editorial">10</head>
            <p> And if thou shouldest say that Christ has not yet come, I will grant this also to
               thy contentiousness. For it is written that when He shall come, the Gentiles shall
               expect Him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n27"/> Lo! I, one of the Gentiles, have heard that Christ is to come. And
               when as yet He had not come, I beforehand have believed on Him; and through Him I
               worship the God of Israel. When He comes, will He then blame me because before His
               coming I beforehand believed on Him? But, thou fool, the prophets suffer thee not to
               say that Christ has not yet come; for Daniel confutes thee,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28"/> saying:—After
               sixty-two weeks shall Messiah come and shall be slain. And in His coming shall the
               Holy City be laid waste, and her end shall be with a flood. And until the
               accomplishment of the things that are determined, shall she continue in desolation.
               Thou expectest and hopest that, at the coming of Christ, Israel shall be gathered
               together from all regions, and Jerusalem shall be built up and inhabited. But Daniel
               testifies that, when Christ comes and is slain, Jerusalem shall be destroyed, and
               shall continue in desolation until the accomplishment of the things which are
               determined, forever. And concerning the suffering of Christ, David said:—They pierced
               my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out. They gazed and looked upon me, and
               divided my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture did they cast the lot.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29"/> And
               Isaiah said:—Lo! My servant shall be known and shall be revealed and shall be lifted
               up, so that many shall be astonished at Him. As for this man, His visage shall be
               marred more than that of man, and His aspect more than that of the sons of men.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/>
               And he said:—He will purify many nations, and kings shall be amazed at Him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> And
               he said in that passage:—He came up as a little child before Him, and as a root from
               the dry ground.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/> And in the end of the passage he said:—He shall be slain for our
               sins; He shall be humiliated for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace is upon
               Him, and by His bruises shall we be healed.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> By what wounds were men healed? David
               was not slain; for he died in a good old age, and was buried in Bethlehem. And if
               they should say that it is spoken of Saul, for Saul was killed in the mountains of
               Gilboa in the battle with the Philistines, and if they should say that they pierced
               his hands and his feet, when they fastened up his body on the wall of Bethshan; yet
               it does not fitly apply to Saul. When the limbs of Saul were pierced, his bones were
               not conscious of suffering, because he was dead. It was after Saul died, that they
               hanged his body and those of his sons on the wall of Bethshan. But when David said,
               They pierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out, he said in the next
               verse:—O God, abide for my help, and deliver my soul from the sword.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/> Now Christ
               was delivered from the sword, and ascended from out of Sheol, and revived and rose
               the third day, and so God abode for His help. But Saul called upon the Lord and He
               did not answer him; and he asked through the Prophets, but no answer was given to
               him. And he disguised himself and inquired by soothsayers, and learned from thence.
               He was worsted before the Philistines, and he slew himself with his own sword, when
               he saw that the battle had overcome him. Moreover in this passage David said:—I will
               declare Thy name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I
               glorify Thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/> How can these things apply to Saul? And again David said:—Thou
               didst not give Thy holy one to see corruption.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n36"/> But all these things fitly apply
               to Christ. When He came to them, they did not receive Him; but wickedly judged Him by
               false witness. And He was hung upon the tree by His hands, and they pierced His hands
               and His feet with the nails which they fastened in him; and all His bones cried out.
               And on that day a great prodigy happened. namely, that the light became dark in the
               middle of the day, as Zechariah prophesied, saying:—The day shall be known unto the
               Lord. It shall not be daytime, and it shall not be night; and at the evening time
               there shall be light.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/> Now what is the day that was distinguished by the prodigy,
               that it was neither daytime nor night, and that at the evening time there was light?
               Evidently the day on which they crucified Him, for in the midst of that day there
               came darkness, and at the evening time there was light. And again he said:—That day
               there shall be cold and frost.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n38"/>—As thou knowest, on that day on which they
               crucified Him, it was cold, and they had made them a fire to warm themselves when
               Simon came and stood with them. And again he said:—The spear shall arise against the
               shepherd, and against the man, My friend;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39"/>and it shall smite the shepherd, and the
               sheep of his flock shall be scattered; and I will turn back My hand upon the
               pastor.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40"/> And furthermore David said concerning His Passion:—For My meat they gave
               gall, and for My thirst did they give Me vinegar to drink.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41"/>—Again he said in that
               passage:—They have persecuted Him Whom Thou hast smitten; and have added to the
               affliction of Him that was slain. For they added many (afflictions) to Him, much that
               was not written concerning Him, cursings and revilings, such as the Scripture could
               not reveal, for their revilings were hateful. But, however, the Lord was pleased to
               humiliate Him and afflict Him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42"/> And He was slain for our iniquity,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43"/> and was
               humiliated for our sins, and was made sin in His own person.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44"/> </p>

            <p> We worship those mercies, and bow the knee before the Majesty of His Father, Who
               converted our worship to Him. We call Him God, just as Moses (was called God); and
               Firstborn, and Son, just as Israel (was called); and Jesus (Joshua), just as Joshua
               the son of Nun was so called; and Priest like Aaron, and King, like David; and great
               Prophet, like all the Prophets; and Shepherd, like the shepherds who tended and
               guided Israel. And so did He call children as He said:—Strange children shall hearken
               unto Me.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n45"/> And He has made us brothers unto Himself, He said:—I will declare Thy
               name unto My brethren.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n46"/> And we have become friends unto Him, as He said to His
               disciples:—I have called you friends,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n47"/> even as His Father called Abraham My
               friend.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n48"/> And He said unto us:—I am the good Shepherd, the Door, the Way, the Vine,
               the Sower, the Bridegroom, the Pearl, the Lamp, the Light, the King, God, Saviour,
               and Redeemer. And by many names is He surnamed. </p>
