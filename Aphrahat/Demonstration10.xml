            <p> Pastors are set over the flock, and give the sheep the food of life. Whosoever is
               watchful, and toils in behalf of his sheep, is careful for his flock, and is the
               disciple of our Good Shepherd, who gave Himself in behalf of His sheep.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> And
               whosoever brings not back his flock carefully, is likened to the hireling who has no
               care for the sheep. Be ye like, O Pastors, to those righteous Pastors of old. Jacob
               fed the sheep of Laban, and guarded them and toiled and was watchful, and so received
               the reward. For Jacob said to Laban:—Lo! twenty years am I with thee. Thy sheep and
               thy flocks I have not robbed and the males of thy sheep I have not eaten. That which
               was broken I did not bring unto thee, but thou required it at my hands! In the
               daytime the heat devoured me and the cold by night.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> My sleep departed from my
               eyes. Observe, ye Pastors, that Pastor, how he cared for his flock. He used to watch
               in the night-time to guard it and was vigilant; and he used to toil in the daytime to
               feed it. As Jacob was a pastor, so Joseph was a pastor and his brethren were pastors.
               Moses was a pastor, and David also was a pastor. So Amos was a pastor. These all were
               pastors who fed the sheep and led them well. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">

            <p> Now, why, my beloved, did these pastors first feed the sheep, and were then chosen
               to be pastors of men? Clearly that they might learn how a pastor cares for his sheep,
               and is watchful and toils in behalf of his sheep. And when they had learned the
               manners of pastors, they were chosen for the pastoral office. Jacob fed the sheep of
               Laban and toiled and was vigilant and led them well; and then he tended and guided
               well his sons, and taught them the pattern of pastoral work. And Joseph used to tend
               the sheep along with his brethren; and in Egypt he became guide to a numerous people,
               and led them back, as a good pastor does his flock. Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his
               father-in-law, and he was chosen from (tending) the sheep to tend his people, and as
               a good pastor he guided them. Moses bore his staff upon his shoulder, and went in
               front of his people that he was leading, and tended them for forty years; and he was
               vigilant and toiled on behalf of his sheep, a diligent and good pastor. When his Lord
               wished to destroy them because of their sins, in that they worshipped the calf, Moses
               prayed and besought of his Lord and said:—Either pardon the people for their sins, or
               else blot me out from Thy book that Thou hast written.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> That is a most diligent
               pastor, who delivered over himself on behalf of his sheep. That is an excellent
               leader, who gave himself in behalf of his sheep. And that is a merciful father who
               cherished his children and reared them up. Moses the great and wise shepherd, who
               knew how to lead back the flock, taught Joshua the son of Nun, a man full of the
               spirit, who (afterwards) led the flock, even all the host of Israel. He destroyed
               kings and subdued the land, and gave them the land as a place of pasturage, and
               divided the resting-places and the sheepfolds to his sheep. Furthermore, David fed
               his father’s sheep, and was taken from the sheep to tend his people. So he tended
               them in the integrity of his heart and by the skill of his hands he guided them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/>
               And when David numbered the flock of his sheep, wrath came upon them, and they began
               to be destroyed. Then David delivered himself over on behalf of his sheep, when he
               prayed, saying:—O Lord God, I have sinned in that I have numbered Israel. Let Thy
               hand be on me and on my father’s house. These innocent sheep, in what have they
               sinned?<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> So also all the diligent pastors used thus to give themselves on behalf of
               their sheep. </p>

            <p> But those pastors who did not care for the sheep, those were hirelings who used to
               feed themselves alone. On this account the Prophet<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> addresses them, saying to
               them:—O ye pastors who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, hear the word of
               the Lord. Thus saith the Lord: Lo! I will visit My sheep as the pastor visits his
               flock in the day of the whirlwind, and I will require My sheep at your hands. O
               foolish pastors, with the wool of the sheep do ye clothe yourselves and the flesh of
               the fatlings do eat, and the sheep ye do not feed. That which was sick ye did not
               heal, and that which was broken ye did not bind. The weak ye did not strengthen, and
               the lost and the scattered ye did not gather together. The strong ones and the
               fatlings ye did guard, but with harshness ye subdued them. The good pastures ye
               yourselves graze upon, and what remains ye trample with your feet. The pleasant
               waters do ye drink, and whatever remains ye defile with your feet. And My sheep have
               eaten the trampled (herbage) which your feet have trampled, and they have drunk the
               waters which your feet have defiled. These are the greedy and base pastors and
               hirelings, who did not feed the sheep, or guide them well, or deliver them from the
               wolves. But when the Great Pastor, the chief of pastors, shall come, He will call and
               visit His sheep and will take knowledge of His flock. And He will bring forward those
               pastors, and will exact an account from them, and will condemn them for their deeds.
               And those who fed the sheep well, them the Chief of Pastors will cause to rejoice and
               to inherit life and rest. O stupid and foolish pastor, to whose right hand and to
               whose right eye I committed my sheep. Because thou didst say concerning the sheep,
               let that which dieth, die, and let that which perisheth perish, and whatever is left,
               let them devour the flesh of one another; therefore, behold I will make blind thy
               right eye and I will wither up thy right arm. Thy eye which regarded a bribe shall be
               blinded, and thy hand which did not rule in righteousness shall waste away.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> And as
               for you, my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men; but I am the Lord your
               God.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> Behold henceforth will feed you in a good and rich pasture.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <head type="editorial">4</head>
            <p> The good shepherd giveth himself for the sake of his sheep.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> And again He said:—I
               have other sheep and I must bring them also hither. And the whole flock shall be one,
               and one shepherd, and My Father because of this loveth Me; that I give Myself for the
               sake of the sheep.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> And again He said;—I am the door of the sheep. Every one that
               entereth by Me shall live and shall go in and go out and find pasture.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> O ye
               pastors, be ye made like unto that diligent pastor, the chief of the whole flock, who
               cared so greatly for his flock. He brought nigh those that were afar off. He brought
               back the wanderers. He visited the sick. He strengthened the weak. He bound up the
               broken. He guarded the fatlings. He gave himself up for the sake of the sheep. He
               chose and instructed excellent leaders, and committed the sheep into their hands, and
               gave them authority over all his flock. For He said to Simon Cephas:—Feed My sheep
               and My lambs and My ewes.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> So Simon fed His sheep; and he fulfilled his time and
               handed over the flock to you, and departed. Do ye also feed and guide them well. For
               the pastor who cares for his sheep engages in no other pursuit along with that. He
               does not make a vineyard, nor plant gardens, nor does he fall into the troubles of
               this world. Never have we seen a pastor who left his sheep in the wilderness and
               became a merchant, or one who left his flock to wander and became a husbandman. But
               if he deserts his flock and does these things he thereby hands over his flock to the
               wolves. </p>

            <p> And remember, my beloved, that I wrote to thee concerning our fathers of old that
               they first learned the ways of tending sheep and in that received trial of
               carefulness, and then were chosen for the office of guides, that they might learn and
               observe how much the pastor cares for his flock, and as they used to guide the sheep
               carefully, so also might be perfected in this office of guidance. Thus Joseph was
               chosen from the sheep, to guide the Egyptians in the time of affliction. And Moses
               was chosen from the sheep, to guide his people and tend them. And David was taken
               from following the sheep, to become king over Israel. And the Lord took Amos from
               following the sheep, and made him a prophet over his people. Elisha likewise was
               taken from behind the yoke, to become a prophet in Israel. Moses did not return to
               his sheep, nor did he leave his flock that was committed to him. David did not return
               to his father’s sheep, but guided his people in the integrity of his heart.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> Amos
               did not turn back to feed his sheep, or to gather (the fruit of) trees, but he guided
               them and performed his office of prophecy. Elisha did not turn back to his yoke, but
               served Elijah and filled his place. And he<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> who was for him as a shepherd, because
               he loved fields and merchandise and vineyards and oliveyards and tillage, did not
               wish to become his disciple; and (therefore) he did not commit the flock into his
               hand. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <head type="editorial">6</head>
            <p> I beseech you, ye pastors, that ye set not over the flock, leaders who are foolish
               and stupid, covetous also and lovers of possessions. Every one who feeds the flock
               shall eat of their milk.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> And every one who guides the yoke shall be ministered to
               from his labour. The priests have a right to partake of the altar, and the Levites
               shall receive their tithes. Whoever eats of the milk, let his heart be upon the
               flock; and let him that is ministered to from the labour of his yoke, take heed to
               his tillage. And let the priests who partake of the altar serve the altar with
               honour. And as for the Levites who receive the tithes, they have no portion in
               Israel. O pastors, disciples of our great Pastor, be ye not like hirelings; because
               the hireling cares not for the sheep. Be ye like our Sweet Pastor, Whose life was not
               dearer to Him than His sheep. Rear up the youths and bring up the maidens; and love
               the lambs and let them be reared in your bosoms; that when ye shall come to the Chief
               Pastor, ye may offer to Him all your sheep in completeness, and so He may give you
               what He has promised: Where I am, ye also shall be.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> These things, brief as they
               are, will be sufficient for the good pastors and leaders. </p>

            <p> Above, my beloved, I have written to remind thee of the character that becomes the
               whole flock. And in this discourse I have written to thee about the pastors, the
               guides of the flock. These reminders I have written to thee, beloved, as thou didst
               ask of me in thy dear letter. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <head type="editorial">8</head>
            <p> The Steward brought me into the King’s treasury and showed me there many precious
               things; and when I saw them my mind was captivated with the great treasury. And as I
               looked upon it, it dazzled my eyes, and took captive my thoughts, and caused my
               reflections to wander in many ways. Whosoever receives thereof, is himself enriched,
               and enriches (others). It lies open and unguarded before all that seek it; and though
               many take from it there is no deficiency; and when they give of that which they have
               received, their own portion is greatly multiplied. They that receive freely let them
               give freely<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> as they have received. For (this treasure) cannot be sold for a
               price, because there is nothing equivalent to it. Moreover the treasure fails not;
               and they that receive it are not satiated. They drink, and are still eager; they eat,
               and are hungry. Whosoever is not thirsty, finds not ought to drink; whoever is not
               hungry, finds nothing to eat. The hunger for it satisfies many, and from the thirst
               for it flow forth water-springs. For the man who draws nigh to the fear of God is
               like the man who in his thirst draws near to the water-spring and drinks and is
               satisfied, and the fountain is not a whit diminished. And the land that needs to
               drink in water, drinks of the fountain, but its waters fail not. And when the land
               drinks, it needs again to drink, and the spring is not lessened by its flowing. So is
               the knowledge of God. Though all men should receive of it, yet there would come no
               lack in it, nor can it be limited by the sons of flesh. He that takes from it, cannot
               take away all; and when he gives, he lacks nothing. When thou takest fire with a
               candle from a flame, though thou kindle many candles at it, yet the flame does not
               diminish when thou takest from it, nor does the candle fail, when it kindles many.
               One man cannot receive all the King’s treasure, nor when a thirsty man drinks of the
               fountain, do its waters fill. When a man stands on a lofty mountain, his eye does not
               (equally) comprehend the near and the distant; nor, when he stands and counts the
               stars of heaven, can he set limits to the hosts of the heavens. So when he draws nigh
               unto the fear of God, he cannot attain to the whole of it; and when he receives much
               that is precious, it does not seem to be diminished; and when he gives of that which
               he has received, it is not exhausted, nor has it come to an end for him. And
               remember, my beloved, what I wrote to thee, in the first discourse, about faith, that
               whoever has freely received ought to give freely as he has received, as our Lord
               said:—Freely ye have received, freely give.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> For whosoever keeps back part of
               anything he has received,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> even that which he has obtained shall be taken away
               from him. Therefore, my beloved, as I have been able to obtain now from that treasure
               that fails not, I have sent unto thee from it. Yet though I have sent it to thee, it
               is all with me. For the treasure fails not, for it is the wisdom of God; and the
               steward is our Lord Jesus Christ, as He testified when He said:—All things have been
               committed to Me by My Father.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> And while He is the steward of the wisdom, again,
               as the Apostle said:—Christ is the power of God and His wisdom.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/> This wisdom is
               imparted to many, yet nothing is lacking, as I explained to thee above; the Prophets
               received of the spirit of Christ, yet Christ was not a whit diminished. </p>

            <p> Ten treatises have I written unto thee, my beloved. Whatsoever thou hast asked of
               me, I have explained to thee without (receiving) ought from thee. And that which thou
               enquiredst not of me, I have given unto thee. I have asked thy name and written unto
               thee. I have asked of myself thy question, and I have answered thee as I was able,
               for thy persuasion. Whatsoever I have written unto thee, meditate in these things at
               every time; and labour to read those books which are read in the church of God. These
               ten little books that I have written for thee, they borrow one from another, and
               depend one upon another. Separate them not one from another. From Olaph to Yud I have
               written for thee, each letter after its fellow. Read thou and learn thou and the
               brethren, the monks, and the faithful, they from whom mocking is far removed; as I
               wrote unto thee above. And remember that which I pointed out to thee, that I have not
               brought these matters to an end, but short of the end. Nor are these things
               sufficient; but hear thou these things from me without wrangling, and enquire
               concerning them with brethren who are apt for persuasion. Whatsoever thou hearest
               that assuredly edifies, receive; and whatever builds up strange doctrines, overthrow
               and utterly demolish. For wrangling cannot edify. But I, my beloved, as a stonecutter
               have brought stones for the building, and let wise architects carve them out and lay
               them in the building; and all the labourers that toil in the building shall receive
               reward from the Lord of the house.</p>
