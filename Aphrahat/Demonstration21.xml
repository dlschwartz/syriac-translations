            <p> I have heard a reproach, which has greatly vexed me. The unclean (the heathen) say,
               that this people, which is gathered together out of all nations, has no God. And thus
               say the impious:—“If they have a God, why does He not avenge His people?” And
               darkness more exceedingly has thickened upon me, because the Jews also reproach us,
               and magnify themselves over the children of our people. It happened one day, that a
               man, who is called wise amongst the Jews, questioned me, saying:—Jesus, Who is called
               your Teacher, wrote for you, that If there shall be in you faith like one grain of
               mustard, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove from before you;
               and (ye shall say) even, Be lifted up and fall into the sea, and it shall obey
               you.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> So apparently there is in all your people not one wise man, whose prayer is
               heard, and who asks of God that your persecutors should cease from you. For clearly
               it is written for you in that passage, There is nothing which ye shall not be able to
               do. </p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="2">

            <p> And when I saw that he was blaspheming and speaking much against the Way (the
               Christian religion), my mind was disturbed, and I understood that he would not admit
               the interpretation of the words that he quoted to me. Then I also questioned him on
               sayings from the Law and from the Prophets, and said to him:—Do ye trust that even
               when ye are dispersed God is with you? And he professed to me, “God is with us,
               because that God said unto Israel:—Even in the lands of their enemies, I yet did not
               forsake them, nor did I make void My covenant with them.”<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> In answer I said to
               him:—“Right good is this that I have heard from thee, that God is with you. Against
               thy words will I also speak unto thee. For I said the Prophet said unto Israel, as
               from the mouth of God:—If thou shalt pass through the sea, I will be with thee, and
               the rivers shall not overflow thee; and if thou shalt walk upon fire, thou shalt not
               be burned, and the flame shall not search thee; because the Lord thy God is with
               thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> Thus there is not one righteous and good and wise man out of all your
               people, who could pass through the sea and live and not be drowned; or (through) the
               river without its overflowing him; or who could walk over fire and see whether he
               would not be scorched and whether the flame would not burn him. And if thou shalt
               bring to me an explanation, I will not be persuaded by thee, just as thou also dost
               not accept from me the interpretation of the words as to which thou hast questioned
               me.” </p>

         <div type="section" n="3">

            <p> Furthermore I questioned him about another saying that is written in Ezekiel;
               namely, that he said to Jerusalem:—Sodom and her daughters shall be built up as of
               old, and thou and thy daughters shall become as of old.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> So he explained this
               saying to me, and began to make a defence, and said to me “As to this that God said
               to Jerusalem by the Prophet, Sodom and her daughters shall be built up as of old, and
               thou and thy daughters shall become as of old; this is the force of the passage, that
               Sodom and her daughters shall be in their place as of old, and shall be made subject
               to Israel; and Jerusalem and her daughters shall be in the splendour of royalty as of
               old.” When I heard this defence from him, it was very contemptible in my eyes, and I
               said to him:—“Inasmuch as the words of the Prophet were said in wrath, is the whole
               passage wrathful, or is part of it wrathful and part of it gracious?” He answered:—“A
               wrathful passage is altogether wrath, and there is no peace in it.” And I said to
               him:—“Since thou hast instructed me that there is no peace in that wrathful passage,
               hear without contention and blaspheme not, and I will instruct thee about this
               saying. For from the top to the bottom the whole passage is said in wrath. For he
               said to Jerusalem:—As I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom and her daughters did not do
               at all as thou and they daughters have done.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> And he said to her (Jerusalem):—Be
               abashed and accept thy shame, that thou hast overcome thy sisters in thy sins, and
               they are justified rather than thou.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> Since he says that Sodom and her daughters
               were justified rather than Jerusalem and her daughters, and that Jerusalem overcame
               Sodom in her sins, it is right that when Israel shall be gathered together, its seat
               should be in Sodom and Gomorrha. For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the
               planting of Gomorrha. Their grapes are bitter and their clusters gall unto them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/>
               And Isaiah also calls them rulers of Sodom, and people of Gomorrha.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> For if Israel
               is gathered together, in Sodom and Gomorrha ought they to dwell with the rulers of
               Sodom and with the people of Gomorrha; and on the vine of Sodom and planting of
               Gomorrha to eat bitter grapes and gather clusters of gall; and to eat the eggs of the
               basilisk and to clothe themselves with spiders’ webs,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> to be used with wild grapes
               of the vineyard,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> and to be turned into reprobate silver.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/> And Sodom and her
               daughters, who were justified rather than Jerusalem, shall be built up as of old. And
               Jerusalem, that surpassed Sodom in her sins, shall continue in her sins, and shall
               remain in desolation until the accomplishment of the things determined for ever.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/>
            </p>

         <div type="section" n="4">
            <head type="editorial">4</head>
            <p> And Ezekiel said:—This is the iniquity of Sodom and of her daughters, that they did
               not take by the hand the poor and needy; and when I saw these things in them, I
               overthrew them.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> And consider and see that, from the time that Sodom was
               overthrown until Jerusalem was built, there were eight hundred and ninety-six years.
               From the time that Abraham was informed by God through the Angel that at this time
               next year I will return to thee, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> from that
               time till Jacob entered Egypt was a hundred and ninety-one years: and the children of
               Jacob were in Egypt two hundred and twenty-five years. So all the years from the time
               that Isaac was conceived and Sodom overthrown were four hundred and sixteen years,
               and from the Exodus of Israel from Egypt till the great edifice of Jerusalem was
               built up by Solomon, and the temple was built, there were four hundred and eighty
               years. Therefore all the years from the conception of Isaac and the overthrow of
               Sodom till the great building of Jerusalem, were eight hundred and ninety-six years.
               And from the great building of Jerusalem until the destruction of Jerusalem there
               were four hundred and twenty-five years. The sum of all the years from the time of
               the overthrow of Sodom until Jerusalem was laid waste, was one thousand three hundred
               and twenty-one. These are all the years that Sodom and her daughters were laid waste
               before Jerusalem. And she that was more just than Jerusalem is not yet inhabited.
               Therefore the whole sum of the years from the overthrow of Sodom till the six hundred
               and fifty-fifth year of the Kingdom of Alexander, the son of Philip of Macedon,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/>
               is two thousand two hundred and seventy-six years. And from the time that Jerusalem
               was laid waste by the Babylonians until the present time is nine hundred and
               fifty-five years. And Jerusalem has been inhabited, after the Babylonians laid it
               waste, during those seventy weeks about which Daniel testified. Then it was laid
               waste in its last destruction by the Romans, and it shall not be inhabited again for
               ever, for it abideth in desolation until the accomplishment of the things
               determined.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> So then, all the years of the former and latter desolation of
               Jerusalem have been four hundred and sixty-five years, and when thou dost deduct from
               them the seventy years of Babylon, they have been three hundred and ninety-five
               years. </p>

            <p> All this argument have I written to thee, because the Jews pride themselves,
               (saying), “It has been covenanted to us, that we shall be gathered.” For if Sodom,
               whose iniquity was not so great as that of Jerusalem, is not as yet inhabited, and if
               we say thus, that it will not be restored for ever, how shall Jerusalem be restored,
               whose iniquity is greater than that of Sodom and her daughters? As for Sodom God has
               not had mercy on her for two thousand two hundred and seventy-six years; and shall we
               say that He will have mercy on Jerusalem? For up to the present there are but three
               hundred and ninety-five years from the day that she was laid waste, according to the
               calculation that has been written above. But as to this that he said, Sodom and her
               daughters shall be possessed as of old,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> and with regard to Jerusalem he said,
               Thou and thy daughters shall become as of old, this is the force of the passage; that
               they shall not be inhabited for ever; for the Lord also thus cursed the land against
               which He was wroth:—It shall not be sown, nor shall it produce, nor shall any herb
               spring up in it, but it shall be like Sodom and Gomorrha, against which the Lord was
               wroth and towards which He was not appeased.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> Therefore be sure, my hearer, that
               Sodom and her daughters shall not be inhabited for ever; but they shall be as of old,
               namely, as in that time when they were not as yet inhabited, and as in the time when
               the Lord was wroth with them and was not appeased towards them. And Jerusalem and her
               daughters shall be as of old, (that is) as in the former time when the mountain of
               the Amorites lay in desolation, whereon Abraham built the altar, when he bound upon
               it Isaac his son; and as it was desolate when David bought the threshing-floor from
               Araunah the Jebusite, and built there the altar. For consider and see that this
               mountain whereon Abraham offered his son is the mountain of Jebus, which is
               Jerusalem. And this place of the threshing-floor that David bought of Araunah is that
               whereon the Temple was built. Thus Jerusalem shall be in desolation as of old. And
               consider that when Ezekiel prophesied this passage, Jerusalem still was sitting in
               her greatness, and those who were in her were rebelling against the King of Babylon.
               And that which the Prophet spoke, he said in wrath and reproach against Jerusalem.

         <div type="section" n="6">
            <head type="editorial">6</head>
            <p> Consider and observe, my hearer, that if God had given a hope to Sodom and to her
               fellows, He would not have overthrown them with fire and brimstone, the sign of the
               last day of the world, but would have delivered them over to one of the kingdoms to
               be chastised. As it is written that when Jeremiah caused the nations and kingdoms to
               drink the cup of wrath, he said concerning each one of the cities, that after they
               shall drink the cup, I will turn back the captivity of Elam, of Tyre, of Zidon, of
               the children of Ammon, and of Moab, and of Edom.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> Concerning each one of these
               kingdoms he said:—In the last days I well turn back her captivity. Now we see that
               Tyre was inhabited, and was opulent after she had wandered seventy years,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> and
               after she had received the reward of her harlotries and after she had committed
               fornication with all kingdoms. And she took the harp, and played it sweetly, and
               multiplied her music. And also the region of Elam is inhabited and opulent. And with
               regard to Babylon Jeremiah said:—Babylon shall fall, and shall not rise.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> And lo!
               unto this day does it continue in desolation, and will do so for ever. And also about
               Jerusalem he said:—The virgin of Israel shall fall, and shall not rise again. She is
               forsaken upon the ground and there is none to raise her up.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n22"/> For if the prophecy
               is true which Jeremiah spoke about Babylon, also that about Jerusalem is true and
               worthy of faith. And Isaiah said unto Jerusalem:—I will not again be wroth with thee,
               nor will I reprove thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n23"/> Of a truth He will not again be wroth with her, nor will
               He reprove her for ever; for that which is in desolation He will not reprove, nor
               will she provoke him to wrath. </p>

               let them be ashamed themselves, that at every time they have been persecuted, even
               for many years before they were delivered. They were made to serve in Egypt two
               hundred and twenty-five years. And the Midianites<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n24"/> made Israel serve in the days
               of Barak and Deborah.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25"/> The Moabites ruled over them in the days of Ehud;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26"/> the

               Ahab; the Assyrians in the days of Hezekiah.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30"/> The king of Babylon uprooted them
               from their place and dispersed them;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n31"/> and after he had tried and persecuted them
               much, they did not amend, as He said to them:—In vain have I smitten your sons, for
               they did not accept chastisement.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32"/> And again He said:—I have cut off the Prophets,
               and slain them by the word of My mouth.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33"/> And to Jerusalem He said:—By afflictions
               and scourges be instructed, O Jerusalem, lest thy life depart from thee.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34"/> But they
               forsook Him, and worshipped idols, as Jeremiah said concerning them:<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35"/>—Go to the
               distant isles, and send to Kedar, and consider well and see, whether there has been
               (anything) like this, whether the nations change their gods, those that are no gods.
               But My people has changed My honour for that which is not profitable. Be astonished,
               ye heavens, at this; and quake and fear greatly, saith the Lord; because My people
               have done two wickednesses; they have abandoned Me, the fountain of the water of
               life, and they have gone and dug for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns which
               cannot hold water. For the broken cisterns are the fear of images and idols. And He
               calls the heavens to astonishment, because they worshipped the hosts of the heavens.

            <p> Jacob was persecuted, and Esau was a persecutor. Jacob received the blessings and
               the birthright, while Esau was cast out from both. Joseph was persecuted, and his
               brothers were persecutors; Joseph was exalted and his persecutors bowed down before
               him, and so his dreams and his visions were fulfilled. Joseph who was persecuted was
               a type of the persecuted Jesus. His father clothed Joseph in a tunic of divers
               colours; and His Father clothed Jesus with a body (taken) from the Virgin. His father
               loved Joseph more than his brethren, and Jesus is the dear and beloved one of His
               Father. Joseph saw visions and dreamed dreams; Jesus fulfilled the visions and the
               Prophets. Joseph was a shepherd with his brethren; and Jesus is the Chief of
               Shepherds. When his father sent Joseph to visit his brethren, they saw him coming and
               plotted to kill him; and when His Father sent Jesus to visit His brethren, they
               said:—This is the heir; come, let us kill him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n37"/> His brethren cast Joseph into the
               pit; and His brethren brought down Jesus into the abode of the dead. Joseph ascended
               from the pit and Jesus arose from the abode of the dead. Joseph, after he arose from
               the pit, had authority over his brethren; and after Jesus arose from the abode of the
               dead, His Father gave Him a great and excellent name,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n38"/> that His brethren should
               serve Him, and His enemies be put beneath His feet. After that Joseph was made known
               to his brethren, they were abashed and feared and were amazed at his greatness; and
               when Jesus shall come at the last time, when He shall be revealed in His Majesty, His
               brethren will be abashed and fear and be dismayed before Him, because they crucified
               Him. Moreover, Joseph, by the counsel of Judah, was sold into Egypt; and Jesus, by
               the hands of Judas Iscariot, was delivered over to the Jews. When they sold Joseph,
               he answered nothing to his brethren; Jesus also spake not and gave no answer to the
               judges who judged Him. His master wrongfully delivered over Joseph to the prison; and
               His countrymen wrongfully condemned Jesus. Joseph delivered over his two garments,
               one into the hand of his brethren, and the other into the hand of his master’s wife;
               and Jesus delivered over His garments and divided them between the soldiers. Joseph,
               when thirty years old, stood before Pharaoh and became lord of Egypt; and Jesus, when
               about thirty years old, came to the Jordan to be baptized, and received the spirit,
               and went forth to preach. Joseph nourished Egypt with bread; and Jesus nourished the
               whole world with the bread of life. Joseph took to wife the daughter of the wicked
               and unclean priest; and Jesus espoused to Himself the Church (taken) from the unclean
               Gentiles. Joseph died and was buried in Egypt; and Jesus died and was buried in
               Jerusalem. Joseph’s bones his brethren brought up from Egypt; and Jesus His Father
               raised from the abode of the dead, and took up His Body with Him to heaven
               uncorrupted. </p>

            <p> Moses also was persecuted, as Jesus was persecuted. When Moses was born, they
               concealed him that he might not be slain by his persecutors. When Jesus was born they
               carried Him off in flight into Egypt that Herod, His persecutor, might not slay Him.
               In the days when Moses was born, children used to be drowned in the river; and at the
               birth of Jesus the children of Bethlehem and in its borders were slain. To Moses God
               said:—The men are dead who were seeking thy life;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39"/> and to Joseph the angel said in
               Egypt:—Arise, take up the child, and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead
               who were seeking the life of the child to take it away.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40"/> Moses brought out his
               people from the service of Pharaoh; and Jesus delivered all nations from the service
               of Satan. Moses grew up in Pharaoh’s house; and Jesus grew up in Egypt when Joseph
               brought Him there in flight. Miriam<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41"/> stood on the edge of the river when Moses was
               floating in the water; and Mary bare Jesus, after the Angel Gabriel had made the
               annunciation to her. When Moses sacrificed the lamb, the firstborn of Egypt were
               slain; and when they crucified Jesus the true Lamb, the people who slew Him perished
               through His slaying. Moses brought down manna for his people; and Jesus gave His Body
               to the nations. Moses sweetened the bitter waters by the wood; and Jesus sweetened
               our bitterness by His cross, by the wood of the tree of His crucifixion. Moses
               brought down the Law to his people; and Jesus gave His covenants to the nations.
               Moses conquered Amalek by the spreading out of his hands; and Jesus conquered Satan
               by the sign of His cross. Moses brought out water from the rock for his people; and
               Jesus sent Simon Cephas (the rock) to carry His doctrine among the nations. Moses
               lifted up the veil from his face and spake with God; and Jesus lifted up the veil
               from the face of the nations, that they might hear and receive His doctrine. Moses
               laid his hand upon his messengers (apostles), and they received priesthood; and Jesus
               laid His hand upon His apostles, and they received the Holy Spirit. Moses ascended
               the mountain and died there; and Jesus ascended into heaven and took his seat at the
               right hand of His Father. </p>

            <p> Also Joshua the son of Nun was persecuted as Jesus our Redeemer was persecuted.
               Joshua the son of Nun was persecuted by the unclean nations; and Jesus our Redeemer
               was persecuted by the foolish people. Joshua the son of Nun took away the inheritance
               from his persecutors and gave it to his people; and Jesus our Redeemer took away the
               inheritance from His persecutors and gave it to strange nations. Joshua the son of
               Nun caused the sun to stand still in the heavens, and took vengeance on the nations
               his persecutors; and Jesus our Redeemer caused the sun to set in the midst of the
               day, that the persecuting people which crucified Him might be ashamed. Joshua the son
               of Nun divided the inheritance unto his people; and Jesus our Redeemer has promised
               to give to the nations the land of life. Joshua the son of Nun caused Rahab the
               harlot to live; and Jesus our Redeemer gathered together and gave life to the Church,
               though polluted by the harlotry (of idolatry). Joshua the son of Nun on the seventh
               day overthrew and cast down the walls of Jericho; and Jesus our Redeemer, on His
               seventh day, on the Sabbath of the rest of God, this world shall be dissolved and
               fall. Joshua the son of Nun stoned Achor, because he stole of the accursed thing; and
               Jesus our Redeemer separated Judas from the disciples, His friends, because he stole
               of the money of the poor. Joshua the son of Nun, when he was dying, laid down a
               testimony among his people; and Jesus our Redeemer, when He was taken up, laid down a
               testimony among His apostles. </p>

               crucified. Jephthah though persecuted arose as leader to his people; Jesus though
               persecuted arose and became King of the Nations. Jephthah vowed a vow and offered up
               his firstborn daughter as a sacrifice; and Jesus was lifted up as a sacrifice to his

               be king instead of Saul who had sinned; and Jesus was anointed by John to be High
               Priest instead of the priests, the ministers of the Law. David was persecuted after
               his anointing; and Jesus was persecuted after His anointing. David reigned first over
               one tribe only, and afterwards over all Israel; and Jesus reigned from the beginning
               over the few who believed on Him, and in the end He will reign over all the world.
               Samuel anointed David when he was thirty years old; and Jesus when about thirty years
               old received the imposition of the hand from John. David wedded two daughters of the
               king; and Jesus wedded two daughters of kings, the congregation of the People and the
               congregation of the Gentiles. David repaid good to Saul his enemy; and Jesus taught,
               Pray for your enemies.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42"/> David was the heart of God;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43"/> and Jesus was the Son of
               God. David received the kingdom of Saul his persecutor; and Jesus received the
               kingdom of Israel His persecutor. David wept with dirges over Saul his enemy when he
               died; and Jesus wept over Jerusalem, His persecutor, which was to be laid waste.
               David handed over the kingdom to Solomon, and was gathered to his people; and Jesus
               handed over the keys to Simon, and ascended and returned to Him who sent Him. For
               David’s sake, sins were forgiven to his posterity; and for Jesus’ sake sins are

               Elijah destroyed the servants of Baal; and Jesus trampled upon Satan and his hosts.
               Elijah raised to life the son of the widow; and Jesus raised to life the son of the
               widow, as well as Lazarus and the daughter of the ruler of the Synagogue. Elijah
               sustained the widow with a little bread; and Jesus satisfied thousands with a little

               Elisha prophesied, and there came about abundance in Samaria; and Jesus
               said:—Whosoever eateth of My body and drinketh of My blood shall live for ever.
               Elisha satisfied a hundred men with a little bread; and Jesus satisfied four thousand
               men, besides women and children, with five loaves. Elisha made oil out of water; and
               Jesus made wine out of water. Elisha delivered the widow from her creditor; and Jesus
               delivered the indebted nations. Elisha made the iron to swim and the wood to sink;
               and Jesus raised up that which was sunk in us, and sank that which was light. A dead
               man (laid) upon the bones of Elisha recovered life; and all the nations, who were

               people. Hezekiah prayed and overcame his adversary; and by the crucifixion of Jesus

            <p> These memorials that I have written unto thee, my beloved, concerning Jesus Who was
               persecuted, and the righteous who were persecuted, are in order that those who to-day
               are persecuted for the sake of the persecuted Jesus, may be comforted, for He wrote
               for us and comforted us Himself; for He said:—If they have persecuted Me, they will
               also persecute you. And because of this they will persecute you, that ye are not of
               the world, even as I was not of it.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n68"/> For He wrote before for us:—Your fathers and
               your brothers and your family will deliver you up, and all men shall hate you for My
               name’s sake.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n69"/> And again He taught us:—When they shall bring you before rulers and
               before magistrates, and before kings that hold the world, meditate not before the
               time what ye shall say, and how ye shall make defence; and I will give you a mouth
               and wisdom, that your enemies may not be able to overcome you, because it is not ye
               that speak, but the Holy Spirit of your Father; He shall speak in you.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n70"/> This is
               the spirit which spoke by the mouth of Jacob to Esau, his persecutor; and the spirit
               of wisdom which spoke before Pharaoh by the mouth of the persecuted Joseph; and the
               spirit which spoke by the mouth of Moses in all the prodigies which he did in the
               land of Egypt, and the spirit of knowledge which was given to Joshua, the son of Nun,
               when Moses laid his hand upon him, so that the nations which persecuted him came to a
               complete end before him; and the spirit that uttered psalms by the mouth of the
               persecuted David, by which he used to sing psalms and soothe Saul his persecutor from
               the evil spirit; and the spirit which clothed Elijah, and through him reproved
               Jezebel and Ahab his persecutor; and the spirit which spoke in Elisha, and prophesied
               and made known to the king his persecutor about all that was to happen thereafter;
               and the spirit which was fervent in the mouth of Micaiah when he reproved Ahab his
               persecutor saying:—If thou shalt at all return back, the Lord hath not spoken by
               me;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71"/> and the spirit which strengthened Jeremiah, so that he stood boldly, and by
               it reproved Zedekiah; and the spirit that preserved Daniel and his brethren in the
               land of Babylon; and the spirit that delivered Mordecai and Esther in the place of
               their captivity. </p>

            <p> Hear, my beloved, these names of martyrs, of confessors, and of the persecuted. Abel
               was murdered, and his blood cried out from the earth. Jacob was persecuted, and fled
               and became an exile. Joseph was persecuted, and sold and cast into the pit. Moses was
               persecuted, and fled to Midian. Joshua the son of Nun was persecuted, and made war.
               Jephthah and Samson and Gideon and Barak, these also were persecuted. These are they
               of whom the blessed Apostle said:—Time fails me to narrate their victories.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n72"/> David
               also was persecuted at the hands of Saul, and he walked in the mountains and in dens,
               and in caves.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73"/> Samuel also was persecuted, and mourned over Saul. Furthermore
               Hezekiah was persecuted, and bound up in affliction. Elijah was persecuted, and
               walked in the desert. Elisha was persecuted and became an exile; and Micaiah was
               persecuted, and cast into prison. Jeremiah was persecuted, and they cast him into the
               pit of mire. Daniel was persecuted, and cast into the pit of lions. Hananiah also and
               his brethren were persecuted, and cast into the furnace of fire. Mordecai and Esther
               and the children of their people were persecuted, at the hands of Haman. Judas
               Maccabæus and his brethren were persecuted, and they also endured reproach. The seven
               brethren, sons of the blessed woman, endured torments by bitter scourgings,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n74"/> and
               were confessors and true martyrs, and Eleazar, aged and advanced in years as he was,
               proved a noble example and made (his) confession and became a true martyr.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n75"/> </p>

            <p> Great and excellent is the martyrdom of Jesus. He surpassed in affliction and in
               confession all who were before or after. And after Him was the faithful martyr
               Stephen whom the Jews stoned. Simon (Peter) also and Paul were perfect martyrs. And
               James and John walked in the footsteps of their Master Christ. Also (others) of the
               apostles thereafter in divers places confessed and proved true martyrs. And also
               concerning our brethren who are in the West, in the days of Diocletian there came
               great affliction and persecution to the whole Church of God, which was in all their
               region. The Churches were overthrown and uprooted, and many confessors and martyrs
               made confession. And (the Lord) turned in mercy to them after they were persecuted.
               And also in our days these things happened to us also on account of our sins; but
               also that what is written might be fulfilled, even as our Redeemer said:—These things
               are to be.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n76"/> The Apostle also said:—Also over us is set this cloud of
               confession;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n77"/> which (is) our honour, wherein many confess and are slain. </p>
