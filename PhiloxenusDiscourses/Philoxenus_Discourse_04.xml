            <head type="title">The Fourth Discourse: On faith, and how by simplicity a man may receive the
               commandments of <persName>Christ</persName>.</head>
            <p>Our <persName>Lord</persName> hath given unto us in His Gospel an easy and simple beginning, [that is,]
               the true and certain faith which is stirred up naturally in the simple mind, so that
               by this faith we may be obedient unto Him, and keep His commandments, even as all the
               righteous men of early times who were called by God hearkened unto His word with
               simplicity, and by faith they made certain of His promises. Now by simplicity is not
               to be understood the simplicity of the world, I mean stupidity, but the singleness of
               one thought (or mind) which is simple to hear and judgeth not, and which accepteth
               and enquireth not, after the manner of a child receiving the words from his nurse,
               and like a child also who receiveth the instruction of books from his master without
               criticising, or asking questions [concerning] those things which are said to him. For
               as the capacity of the child is too little to investigate human learning, so also is
               the measure of our mind too little to be able to understand the explanation of divine
               Mysteries. And therefore by faith and simplicity only can a man hear and receive,
               even as <persName>Abraham</persName>, who was called, went forth after <pb type="external" n="75"/>God,
               and he was not a judge of the voice which [came] to him, and he was not held back by
               race and kinsfolk, <pb n="71"/>nor by country and friends, nor by any of the many
               other human ties. Immediately he heard the voice and knew that it was of God, he
               despised everything and went forth to Him, and hearkened unto Him with simplicity.
               And he held Him to be certain and sure [in his mind] by faith, and by the natural
               simplicity which acteth not cunningly with evil things; and as a boy after his father
               did he run towards the voice of God, everything being despised in his eyes
               immediately he heard the word of God.</p>
            <p>And there was in him also the knowledge and discretion of nature, but he shewed his
               discernment in that he [found it] right to hearken unto God, Who had called him, as a
               servant to his lord, and as a slave to his Creator. And also to that knowledge in
               which he was [placed] he did not give power to investigate and to enquire why and for
               what reason he had been called by God, <quote>Go forth from thy country, and from thy
               kinsfolk, and come to the land which I will show thee.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71-1"/> And God did not
               reveal to him what the country was, in order that his faith might be the more
               victorious, and his simplicity appear; and while he thought that He was carrying him
               to the land of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, God promised to shew him another land of life which is in
               heaven, even as <persName>Paul</persName> also testifieth, <quote>He waited for a city which hath foundations,
               whose builder and maker is God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71-2"/> And again he said, <quote>It is evident that they
               desired a country better than the land <pb type="external" n="76"/>of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, which
               is heaven.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n71-3"/> And for this reason God teacheth us clearly that it was not that
               material land of promise which God promised to <pb n="72"/>shew to <persName>Abraham</persName>. After
               He had brought him out of <placeName>Ur</placeName> of the Chaldees He made him dwell in <placeName>Harran</placeName>, and He
               did not carry him to the land of <placeName>Canaan</placeName> immediately after his coming forth. And
               again, that <persName>Abraham</persName> might not think that he heard the report of a reward, and
               therefore go forth after the voice of God, He did not make known to him at the
               beginning the name of the country to which He would bring him.</p>
            <p>Look then, O disciple, upon this coming forth, and let thy coming forth be like unto
               it, and be not backward in following the living voice of <persName>Christ</persName>, Who hath called
               thee. For as in that case it called to <persName>Abraham</persName> only, so in this He calleth every
               one He pleaseth by His Gospel, and inviteth [them] to go forth after Him. For in that
               He said, <quote>Whosoever wisheth to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his
               cross and follow Me,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n72-1"/> He shewed a universal calling to all the children of
               men. And instead of choosing one person, <persName>Abraham</persName>, as He did at that time, He now
               inviteth every man to be like unto <persName>Abraham</persName>. And again in the case of the holy
               Apostles, He renewed that [call] of <persName>Abraham</persName>; and observe their faith also, that it
               was like unto the faith of <persName>Abraham</persName>; for as Abraham heard immediately he was called,
               so also immediately He called the Apostles, they heard and went forth after Him. <quote>He
               saw them casting nets into the sea, and He called them, and straightway they forsook
               their nets <pb type="external" n="77"/>and their father, and went after Him;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n72-2"/>
               and before they had heard from Him [the words], <quote>If a man forsake not his father and
               mother, and everything that he hath, and cometh after me, he cannot <pb n="73"/>be My
               disciple,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73-1"/> they forsook everything and went after <persName>Jesus</persName>. For He did not
               propound for the disciples lengthy doctrine, but only the hearing of the word of
               faith; and because the faith which was in them was living, immediately it received
               the living word it became obedient unto life, and they ran thereafter straightway,
               and delayed not. Now in this they show themselves to have been disciples before they
               were called. For the custom of faith which is mingled with simplicity is that it
               receiveth not doctrine (or instruction) by much persuasion, but as the sound and
               healthy eye receiveth not the ray which is sent therein by contrivances and cunning
               inventions—but immediately that it is opened it looketh with strength upon the light,
               because its natural sight is sound—so also the eye of faith, which is set in the
               pupil of simplicity, immediately it heareth the voice of God recogniseth it, and
               there riseth in it the light of His Word. And joyfully it draweth towards Him and
               receiveth Him, even as our <persName>Lord</persName> said in His Gospel, <quote>My sheep hear My voice and
               come after Me.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73-2"/> Wherever natural faith is preserved in its original state,
               [that man], with whom this faith is preserved, is a sheep of the Shepherd. For thus
               is it written concerning <persName>Matthew</persName>, <quote>Our Lord saw him <pb type="external" n="78"
               />sitting at the place of toll,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73-3"/> and He called him, and straightway he forsook
               his merchandise and all his possession, and went after Him.</quote> And concerning <persName>Philip</persName>
               also it is written that He said, <quote>Come after Me,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n73-4"/> and straightway he went
               after Him. In this sincerity and<pb n="74"/>simplicity then the Apostles went after
               the word of <persName>Christ</persName>, and the world was not able to impede them, nor human customs to
               hold them back, nor was any of those things which are esteemed of any value in [this]
               world able to impede those souls which had perceived God. Now there is nothing
               stronger in the world to the man who hath in him the life of faith than the word of
               God. He in whom the word is feeble because of the deadness of his soul, in him is the
               mighty word without power, and in him is the healthy doctrine of God diseased; for in
               whatsoever condition a man liveth, to that turneth every action of his life.
               Whosoever liveth to the world, to the world is directed all the service of his
               thoughts and senses, and whosoever liveth to God, to His mighty commandments turn his
               soul and all his motions; for the burden of the love of earthly things no longer
               hangeth upon those who have been called, when once they are obedient to the voice
               which hath called them. For the fetters of the world are a weight upon the
               understanding and the thoughts, and whosoever is fettered therewith and is bound by
               them heareth the voice of the call of God with difficulty. Now the Apostles were not
               thus, nor were the righteous men and the Fathers of this type, but they hearkened
               like <pb type="external" n="79"/>living men, and went forth like swift ones who were
               unfettered by anything. And who is able to fetter and impede that soul which
               perceiveth God? For it is open and ready that whensoever the light of the divine word
               cometh thereunto, it may find it prepared to receive it.</p>
            <p>Our <persName>Lord</persName> also called <persName>Zacchaeus</persName> from the fig tree,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n74-1"/> <pb n="75"/>and he came
               down immediately, and received Him into his house, for he was waiting to see Him, and
               to be His disciple, even before He called him. And it is a marvellous thing that
               though our <persName>Lord</persName> had neither spoken to him nor seen him in the flesh, yet he had
               believed in Him through the words of others; now the faith which was in him was
               preserved by the life and soundness of its nature. In that <persName>Zacchaeus</persName> heard the
               rumour concerning Him and believed, he shewed faith, and in that he promised to give
               half of his goods to the poor, and to restore fourfold that which he had exacted he
               shewed that the simplicity of faith had dawned in him. For if at that time the mind
               of <persName>Zacchaeus</persName> had not been filled with the simplicity which befitted faith, he would
               never have made this free and full promise to <persName>Jesus</persName> to spend and distribute in a
               short time what had taken him years to collect in [this] world; for what cunning hath
               gathered together simplicity maketh to flow away, and the things which have been
               collected by the schemes of artifice sincerity scattereth. And whatsoever fraud hath
               been able to acquire faith repudiateth, and crieth out that it existeth not, for God
               Himself only is the possession of faith, and it cannot be persuaded to possess <pb
                  type="external" n="80"/>anything else with Him. To faith all possessions are
               little, except that One everlasting Possession, which is God. And, moreover, for this
               reason faith is implanted in us, that it may find and possess God only, and that
               everything which is beyond may [be accounted] a loss.</p>
            <p>Now the Holy Scriptures have shown us that with this mind a man should draw nigh to
               God in faith and simplicity. And for this reason <persName>Adam</persName> and <persName>Eve</persName>, so long as they
               lived in simplicity, and so long as the faith which was <pb n="76"/>in them had not
               been made gross through corporeal passions, immediately they heard the command of God
               they received it, and kept it. For God said to <persName>Adam</persName>, <quote>Thou shalt not eat; and if
               thou eatest, thou shalt die; but if thou keepest the command I will give thee
               everlasting life.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n76-1"/> And by faith <persName>Adam</persName> received [the command], and kept [it],
               and [in] his simplicity he did not judge the command, [saying], <quote>Why hath He withheld
               from us one tree, and given us power over all the others? And He hath promised to
               give me life if I keep the command;</quote> these things because of his simplicity he
               neither judged nor sought to inquire into. Now when the counsel of the <persName>Enemy</persName> came
               and found simplicity, it taught craft and cunning, and sowed in that one simple
               thought, another thought which was its opposite, in order that he who was one man,
               and was wholly and entirely sincere in his simplicity, might be divided into two
               thoughts—the willing and the unwilling, the judging and the being judged, and the
               being in doubt whether he would do [the command] or not—<pb type="external" n="81"
               />and the counsel which the <persName>Enemy</persName> brought to that childlike and simple man made him
               to be a judge of God's command to him. Now <persName>Adam</persName> did not prosper in his judgment
               because it had destroyed his simplicity, for he stupidly thought it meet to listen to
               an enemy rather than to a friend, and to one who killed rather than to one who could
               make alive, and to one who taught wickednesses rather than to one who had been to
               them a teacher of good things. So long as they existed in their simplicity they
               hearkened unto the voice of God, but as soon as they wished to act cunningly they
               became receptacles <pb n="77"/>of the counsel of the <persName>Calumniator</persName>; for cunning is at
               the side of <persName>Satan</persName>, and simplicity is with those who belong to <persName>Christ</persName>. The man who
               wisheth to be cunning and crafty cannot become a disciple of <persName>Christ</persName>, as His
               doctrine requireth. The mind which is full of cunning is at all times destroying and
               building up thoughts which are opposite [to one another]; it bindeth up and looseth,
               it believeth and denieth, at one time it deemeth a thing good, but at another it
               rejecteth it and chooseth another. The mind which is trained in cunning is a channel
               for confused opinions, and it remained not [long enough] in any one [of them] to
               believe it and to support itself thereupon; but simplicity is the opposite of cunning
               in every thing, even as its very name testifieth, for there are in it no thoughts
               which abrogate the others.</p>
            <p>Simplicity hath received the name of being befitting to God, for we also call God
               <quote>Simple</quote> in the words of our confession of Him, because there are in Him neither
               structures nor parts of limbs, and thus also in our ordinary speech a man who is not
               cunning in wickedness is called by us <quote>simple</quote>, because he hath not <pb
                  type="external" n="82"/>in his mind the anxious trepidation of evil things. And he
               knoweth not how to look at and to bring to an issue the things which happen to him
               from the world; and he contriveth no means whereby he may do harm to his enemies, or
               to make an end of the things which are spoken against him, and he weaveth no crafty
               things, and he layeth not snares, and he behaveth not artfully to do harm to others.
               These and such like things simplicity knoweth not how to do, and for this reason the
               mysteries of God have at all times been entrusted to it, and it hath shown itself
               worthy of divine revelations, even as also were the Apostles when they <pb n="78"
               />were chosen. It is well known that the Apostles were the simplest of men, and it
               was for this reason <persName>Jesus</persName> chose them, that by their simplicity He might mock at the
               wisdom of the world, and that by their ignorance He might make manifest the emptiness
               of the learning of the wise and learned, even as <persName>Paul</persName> saith, <quote>God chose the fools
               of [this] world to put its wise men to shame,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78-1"/> And again he said, <quote>Because,
               by the wisdom of God, the world knew not the wisdom of God, God willed that by the
               simplicity of preaching, He might make to live those that believed.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78-2"/> And
               again he said to certain men of his disciples who were boasting in the knowledge of
               the world, <quote>Observe also your calling, my brethren, for there are not many among you
               [who are] wise according to the flesh.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78-3"/> And I have not spoken these things
               wishing to show that there is no wisdom in the doctrine of <persName>Christ</persName>, but that that
               wisdom which is above the world is the wisdom of <persName>Christ</persName>, for the wisdom of the
               world, <pb type="external" n="83"/>is its opposite in all things, even as darkness is
               the opposite of light, and bitterness of sweetness, and sickness of health. For the
               wisdom of God flourisheth not by these things, [that is] the study and care of
               earthly thoughts, but all its meditation is upon spiritual things, and its motions
               and thoughts are above the world, even as the <persName>Apostle</persName> himself testified<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n78-4"/>
               concerning himself, <quote>I am a fool to the wisdom of the world, but by my knowledge I
               possess the wisdom which is above the world.</quote> And in teaching that not every man is
               able to be a hearer and a receiver of that wisdom <pb n="79"/>which he had, he crieth
               out, saying,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n79-1"/> <quote>We speak wisdom among the perfect: not the wisdom of this world
               nor that of the rulers of this world, which are brought to nought: but we speak the
               wisdom of God in a mystery, which none of the wise men of the world hath been able to
               hear.</quote> The wisdom of [this] world is not sufficient for a foundation, nor is it able
               to receive the building of the wisdom of God, and for this reason our <persName>Lord</persName> placed
               simplicity in us for a foundation.</p>
            <p>Who is there that knoweth not how simple was that first union of the first ones of
               the race of the children of men, and how simple they were in respect of all the life
               and conduct of [this] world, for they had had no experience and they had never been
               occupied in any of its affairs, because the conversation of the things of the world
               had not as yet been revealed to them; but they were near unto divine sights, <pb
                  type="external" n="84"/>and God spake unto them continually face to face, and He
               was at all times found in close converse with them, carrying, and bringing, and
               leading them from that place from which they sprang and in which they had been
               framed, and placing them in Paradise. And in the form of a man He was shewing them
               everything as a near friend, and they never took thought in their mind as to where
               was the dwelling of Him that shewed them [these things]; or from what time He was; or
               if He had been made, and if He had been made, who made Him; and why hath He created
               us; and for what reason hath He set us in this Paradise and delivered unto us this
               law. These things were remote from their minds because simplicity thinketh not of
               such, but it is wholly and entirely <pb n="80"/>drawn to listening unto that which it
               heareth, and its whole thought is mingled with the word of him that speaketh with it,
               even as is [that of] the child with the speech of whosoever talketh with him.</p>
            <p>Behold then, in the early heads of our race God placed simplicity, and it became the
               receptacle of the commandment; for simplicity is anterior to faith because faith is
               the daughter of simplicity, but faith giveth not birth to cunning. He that is crafty
               and cunning doth not readily give credence unto what he heareth, but the simple man
               listeneth unto all voices and believeth. Now if simplicity is the sincerity of nature
               it receiveth only the things which are spoken by God. For as the earth was, in its
               natural construction <pb type="external" n="85"/>intended by its Creator to receive
               the seeds and plants which are needful for the wants of mankind—that it bringeth
               forth thorns and briars is not of its own nature, for it received this from its
               Creator afterwards as a penalty—so also hath simplicity been placed in our nature by
               the Creator. But cunning and craftiness we receive afterwards by reason of the
               disputes which come upon us, even as the whole family of the children of men
               testifieth, for in all that are born is simplicity stirred up before craftiness. As
               long as they are infants and children they are filled with innocence and sincerity,
               but when they have lived in the world, through a gradual and progressive growth and
               the matters which befall them, they learn craftiness and cunning. It is as if a man
               were to take away a child one year old, and were to go forth and bring him up in the
               desert, where there is neither conversation of the children of men nor the exercise
               of the affairs of the world, and where he would never see anything at all <pb n="81"
               />of the habits and customs of men; it would then be found that he was in a state of
               natural simplicity, and moreover, when he had arrived at manhood's estate this man
               would be able to receive very much more easily divine visions and spiritual thoughts,
               and he would readily become a vessel to receive the Divine wisdom. In this manner I
               think the matter standeth. And also it was because the marvellous preacher, <persName>John the
               Baptist</persName>, according to the testimony of the Book,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n81-1"/> lived in the wilderness
               until the day of his showing himself to the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, that he was able to
               receive and to teach Divine mysteries, <pb type="external" n="86"/>and to receive the
               power of the baptism of the Spirit. And of the things which none of the early
               prophets had perceived, he, through the natural simplicity in which he had been
               brought up, became a receptacle in the wilderness—and especially of those things
               which were before the abrogation of the curse and the death of sin, and before the
               wall of enmity which was set in the midst had been broken through,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n81-2"/> of which
               it is written that it was broken through by the Cross of <persName>Christ</persName>—and he became
               aforetime a receiver of the things which were after the Cross; and for this reason
               Grace led him forth to the wilderness that he might remain in the simplicity of
               nature, and be able to receive the knowledge of the mysteries which were above
               nature.</p>
            <p>And in like manner when God redeemed the people out of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, He led them out into
               the desolate wilderness where simplicity could be obtained, and I believe that He
               brought them forth into the desert that, being freed <pb n="82"/>from the customs and
               habits of mankind, and from the cunning and wisdom of the world which they had
               received in the land of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, they might become accustomed to the simplicity of
               nature, and receive divine instruction with sincerity. And although there are many
               other reasons why He brought them out into the wilderness, this seems to be the
               primary reason to him that knoweth how to look at the mysteries of Divine
               dispensation. And because those who went forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName> did not wish to cast off
               from them the wickedness and cunning which they had learned in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, but were in
               every thing opponents of the promise of God towards them, He kept them in the
               wilderness for forty years, that evil, and those who ministered thereunto might
               disappear; <pb type="external" n="87"/>that cunning might perish, together with those
               who had received it from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>; and that that generation which should be born and
               grown up in the wilderness—for all their bringing up was in simplicity, according to
               the law of the place—might go in and inherit the land of promise; because it is
               seemly for those who were brought up in the wilderness to be simple, and it belongeth
               to simplicity to hearken unto the commandments of God, and to be persuaded by them.
               And if any man thinketh that they believed because they saw the signs and wonders in
               the wilderness, or because they feared the penalty which came upon those who were
               before them, it will be found that those who went forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName> saw greater
               wonders than they. For with all the other mighty deeds which were wrought in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>
               they saw also the dividing of the sea, and that fearful passage; and [they saw] that
               the sea returned, and grew together and covered up all the Egyptians who had entered
                  <pb n="83"/>therein;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-1"/> and that marvellous thing which took place at
               <placeName>Marah</placeName>, how by means of a piece of wood the waters were made sweet and became drink
               for them;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-2"/> and to speak briefly, those who went forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName> were
               spectators of all the wonderful things which took place in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and in the
               desert, and of those things which happened meanwhile. But the young generation which
               was born in the desert saw nothing except those wonders which were continually with
               them, the pillar [of fire], the cloud,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-3"/> the rock which poured out
               water,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-4"/> and the quails which came up from the sea;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n83-5"/> and although the
               miracles which they saw were lesser than those which the people who went forth from
               <placeName>Egypt</placeName> saw, yet they, through their simplicity, remained in the fear of God better
               than the men who had seen many and great signs. <pb type="external" n="88"/>And that
               thou mayest know that all the mighty deeds which took place, and all the wonderful
               things which were wrought, were not able to uproot and to abrogate in them the evil
               things which they had learned from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and that that generation which had been
               born in the desert was entirely remote from them by reason of its simplicity,
               understand from this [fact]. After they had arrived at an inhabited land at the end
               of the forty years, and were encamped opposite <placeName>Midian</placeName> wishing to go into the
               countries of the heathen, by reason of the sight of the women whom the Midianites had
               arrayed in fine apparel and set before them, whoredom broke out among the remnant of
               the people who had come forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and they waxed wanton, even as the Holy
               Book maketh known, <quote>The people saw the <pb n="84"/>daughters of <placeName>Midian</placeName> and
               committed whoredom [with them], and they were united with <persName>Baal-Peor</persName>, and worshipped
               idols;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-1"/> now those who did this were, according to what the Book saith, those
               who remained of the people who had gone forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. <quote>And the plague had
               dominion over them, and four and twenty thousand of them died;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-2"/> now the Book
               saith that the number of those who went forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName> amounted to six hundred
               thousand,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-3"/> and God said, <quote>They shall not go in to see the land of
               promise,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-4"/> and by the fact that they alone of all the people died we may
               understand also they only committed whoredom. <quote>And <persName>Moses</persName> and all <placeName>Israel</placeName> were
               sitting before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle, and <persName>Zimri</persName>, the son of
               <persName>Salu</persName>, the chief of the tribe <pb type="external" n="89"/>of <persName>Simeon</persName>, went into the
               cell to <persName>Cozbi</persName>, a daughter of the chiefs of <placeName>Midian</placeName>, in the sight of <persName>Moses</persName> and in
               the sight of all <placeName>Israel</placeName>; and there rose up <persName>Phinehas</persName>, and shewed forth the triumph
               of zeal.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-5"/> Now from the fact that the pestilence had dominion only over that
               remnant which remained of the people who had come forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, it is right
               that we should know that it was they only who drew nigh to that work of wickedness,
               and that all the rest of the people who had been born in the wilderness, and who had
               been reared in the purity and simplicity of the fear of God were sitting at the door
               of God, and were entreating mercy by repentance with <persName>Moses</persName>. And from what took
               place at the casting of the calf<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n84-6"/> I also believe this, for at that time also
               when <persName>Moses</persName> came down from <pb n="85"/>the mountain, and saw the confusion of the
               people, and knew that this incitement [to sin] belonged only to certain of them, he
               ground the calf with a grinder, and scattered its dust upon the waters. And when the
               people had drunk thereof, it became a test of their thoughts, and those men in whose
               imaginations the calf had been first depicted became the men who urged the doing of
               this wickedness; and it is written that in them and in those who were slain by the
               swords of the Levites the sign of the calf appeared. And from the ending of their
               deaths we may also understand that the beginning of error was in them. Because they
               urged on [others] and were the leaders in error, <pb type="external" n="90"/>the
               penalty which the word of <persName>Moses</persName> had decreed also overtook them through the sign of
               the calf which appeared in their persons. And so also here from the fact that
               twenty-four thousand [men] only fell through that sudden pestilence—now the Book
               saith<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n85-1"/> that with them was brought to an end the number of those who went forth
               from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>—it is right that we should know that they only were joined unto
               whoredom. From their penalty let us learn [concerning] their whoredom; and from their
               violent death let us recognize that their whoredom belonged wholly to them, and that,
               remembering the worship of idols in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, when they saw it in <placeName>Midian</placeName> they were
               straightway joined thereunto. And the simplicity of the upright who had been born in
               the desert preserved them for the Lord, and they sat at the door of the tabernacle in
               the purity of their hearts, and with souls remote from cunning, and with thoughts
               free from the craft of wickedness, they entreated mercy <pb n="86"/>of the Lord. And
               for this reason also the promises to <persName>Abraham</persName> of material things were fulfilled in
               them, and simplicity went in and inherited the land of promise, and innocence took
               possession of the border of the inheritance which had been promised to the chief of
               their race, and integrity, which they had [received] from the Lord, made them
               victorious in their wars with the Amorites. For when they had passed over the
               <placeName>Jordan</placeName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86-1"/> <persName>Joshua</persName> commanded them to go round <persName>Jericho</persName> seven days, each day
               once, and on the seventh day to go round seven times, and he and the priests were to
               go before them carrying horns and the ark <pb type="external" n="91"/>of the Lord;
               and the whole people followed after <persName>Joshua</persName> and after the ark in simplicity, like
               children following their fathers. And what shall I say concerning all the rest of the
               people? Concerning <persName>Joshua</persName> the Book pointeth out<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n86-2"/> that in him especially were
               found simplicity and innocence; <quote>But the young man <persName>Joshua</persName> departed not from the
               tent, but was there continually in the service of <persName>Moses</persName>;</quote> and he that was free from
               going out and coming in among the multitude was especially nigh unto simplicity. If
               cunning and wickedness are gathered together from conversation with the multitude, it
               is evident that simplicity and integrity can be acquired from being brought up to
               lead a life of silent contemplation, and the more a man increaseth his life of
               contemplation, the more his possession of simplicity groweth. And concerning this the
               customary life of the world itself testifieth to us that all those who were reared in
               the contemplative life, and who never went forth in the ways, or contended and
               conversed with the multitude, were found to be <pb n="87"/>especially upright and
               simple, and that the integrity which is born from righteousness was found in them,
               even as also the blessed <persName>David</persName> joineth integrity unto innocency in his words, <quote>The
               innocent and upright have cleaved unto me because I waited for Thee.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87-1"/> And
               again that same prophet testifieth concerning the simplicity of his soul, and how he
               was with God, [saying], <quote>I was innocent and ignorant, and I was like a beast before
               Thee;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87-2"/> and he was brought down to such ignorance <pb type="external" n="92"
               />like the beast with man, which by reason of its irrational and indiscriminating
               nature is unable to judge one of his deeds or actions; even thus was the knowledge of
               <persName>David</persName> in respect of God. For as the beast is governed by man, so also did <persName>David</persName>
               place himself to be led by the will of God, that he might not judge His will in any
               form, even as the verse following maketh known, in which he saith, <quote>Because I am like
               a beast before Thee in all innocence, comfort me with Thy counsel, and lead me after
               Thy glory.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87-3"/> And again he saith, <quote>I have not enquired what is in heaven with
               Thee, or what is Thy will upon earth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n87-4"/> For I have never understood the
               distinguishing attributes of Thy government, because while I sought to know why Thou
               didst desire one thing, Thy will willed something else; and because I was confounded
               by the varieties of Thy deeds I ran and took refuge in simplicity. And I became
               before Thee a beast which knoweth not anything, that Thy will alone might govern me,
               and Thy knowledge lead me in the path of life, and that Thou mightest give <pb n="88"
               />me Thy wise care in everything which was necessary for spiritual and bodily
               life.</p>
            <p>And moreover, <persName>David</persName> sheweth in a psalm that the grace of God aboundeth specially
               with the pure in heart, [saying], <quote>God is good to <placeName>Israel</placeName>, [even] to the pure in
               heart;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88-1"/> now he uniteth purity of heart with the sight of God, for [the name]
               <placeName>Israel</placeName> is interpreted <quote>He hath seen God</quote>. And whosoever is simple and pure in heart
               is able to see God, even as <pb type="external" n="93"/><persName>our Lord</persName> spake in His
               Gospel, <quote>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88-2"/> And moreover
               <persName>David</persName> the prophet sheweth that the mind which is remote from the cunning of human
               teachings is particularly able to comprehend the righteousness of God, and to possess
               courage of spirit and the confidence which will contend with all things, [saying],
               <quote>Because I know not the art of writing, I will go in in the strength of the Lord, and
               I will remember Thy righteousness only.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88-3"/> And teaching those who are simple
               and innocent, and those who are wise and understanding, he saith, <quote>[Thou art] my
               doctrine from my youth up, that I might shew Thy wonderful works.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88-4"/> And again
               when he sheweth concerning the purity of his thoughts he likeneth them unto hands,
               and their freedom from iniquity he compareth unto the washing of the hands, [saying],
               <quote>I have washed my hands in innocency,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n88-5"/> that is to say, I have cleansed and
               purified my thoughts, and I have remembered Thy altar, O Lord. And again he saith, <quote>I
               have walked in my house in the innocency of my heart, <pb n="89"/>when wilt Thou come
               unto me?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-1"/> And again he saith, <quote>Whosoever worketh deceit shall not dwell
               within my house,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-2"/> and it is well known that cunning is built up of deceit.
               And again he saith, <quote>Examine me, O Lord, and try me, prove my reins and my
               heart.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-3"/> And again he saith, <quote>I by myself have purified my heart, and washed
               my hands in innocency.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-4"/> And besides these <persName>David</persName>'s election testifieth that
               he was chosen from a station which taught simplicity, for he was chosen from
               following the sheep, even as he himself confesseth and calleth to mind his election
               in one of his psalms, [saying], <quote>He chose <pb type="external" n="94"/><persName>David</persName> His
               servant, and took him from [following] a flock of sheep, and from after the ewes that
               gave suck.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-5"/> And teaching that his kingdom also was governed by simplicity he
               saith, <quote>He pastured them in the integrity of his heart,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-6"/> and it is manifest
               that integrity is simplicity. And the book of his history also sheweth us [his]
               innocency, for on account of his simplicity in the direction of the affairs of [this]
               world he had one to give him counsel concerning human business with him continually;
               for the Book maketh known to us<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-7"/> that <persName>Ahithophel</persName> was <persName>David</persName>'s counsellor.
               And from other things it is easy for us to see the simplicity of the blessed <persName>David</persName>,
               who himself also maketh it known when he spake with <persName>Jonathan</persName>, saying, <quote>There is no
               wickedness in my heart, and [yet] thy father hunteth my life to take it.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n89-8"/> And
               this [is] also [shewn] by that which <pb n="90"/>was said by <persName>Jonathan</persName> to his
               father, <quote>He hath put himself in thy hands; and he made war and slew the Philistines
               by the simplicity of <persName>David</persName> the king.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90-1"/> And again when the men who were with
               him counselled<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90-2"/> him to slay <persName>Saul</persName>, through his simple mind he refrained. That
               they should counsel him to slay his enemy arose from the cunning and craft of [this]
               world, for it is the custom of those who are filled with the cunning of [this] world
               to act craftily to remove obstacles from their path; but <persName>David</persName> in his simplicity
               and mercy refrained. And we might find many things in the Holy Books which make
               manifest the simplicity and uprightness of heart <pb type="external" n="95"/>of this
               man of God, and that also which was said by the Lord unto <persName>Samuel</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90-3"/> <quote>I have
               found a man according to My heart,</quote> testified unto the purity of <persName>David</persName>'s heart, and
               it is well known that simplicity is born of purity of heart. And again <persName>David</persName>
               himself asked in prayer, <quote>Create in me a clean heart, O God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90-4"/> And besides
               these we may also see that all the other just and righteous men pleased God through
               simplicity. Concerning those early disciples who became apostles after the Ascension
               of our Lord into heaven it is thus written, <quote>They all dwelt together, and they were
               of one mind and of one soul, and they were breaking bread in [one] house, and were
               receiving food in rejoicing, and they were praising God in the innocency of their
               heart, and no man said of the possessions which he had, They are mine, for they had
               everything in common.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n90-5"/> Now it is manifest that <pb n="91"/>such innocency as
               this is born of simplicity, and that their praise ascended unto God from the purity
               of their heart; and that they took their food together with rejoicing, the man who
               brought much not considering that he should eat more than the other who cast nothing
               into the common fund, arose from innocency of character.</p>
            <p>And again the Word sheweth that the blessed <persName>Joshua</persName> was the most innocent of all the
               people because he grew up<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91-1"/> being always in the tabernacle, and this man who
               was the most simple and innocent of all the people, <pb type="external" n="96"/>for
               he had been brought up in quietness, was chosen to that famous government after
               <persName>Moses</persName> the Great. And that simplicity is nigher unto those who are brought up in the
               tabernacle or in the house than unto others who are exercised in going in and coming
               out, the history of <persName>Jacob</persName> and <persName>Esau</persName> testifieth. <quote><persName>Esau</persName> was a cunning hunter, a
               man of the field, and <persName>Jacob</persName> was a simple man, dwelling in a tent,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91-2"/> and from
               their works we are able to understand the difference of their characters. In all
               places the Scriptures call <persName>Esau</persName> cunning and crafty, and one who layeth up anger,
               and keepeth wrath, [as it is said], <quote>He keepeth his anger for ever, and he layeth up
               his wrath for ever and ever.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91-3"/> And again [the Book] speaketh concerning his
               anger towards the seed of <persName>Jacob</persName>, <quote>His fiery anger burned for ever, and he was
               furious at them,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91-4"/> and again that he went forth armed to meet his brother with
               four hundred men<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n91-5"/> <pb n="92"/>also sheweth that his anger was of long
               standing; for he had sought to take vengeance upon his brother for the [stealing] of
               the birthright for twenty years after <persName>Jacob</persName> had turned towards <persName>Haran</persName>, and had it
               not been for the humility of <persName>Jacob</persName> and for the hidden dispensation of God which
               changed his anger into pleasantness, he would have performed that to do which he went
               forth. But <persName>Jacob</persName> appeareth as the opposite of this in everything, whether as
               regardeth his parents, or the house of <persName>Laban</persName>, for by his deeds he is shewn to us to
               be a simple and obedient man. And for <pb type="external" n="97"/>this reason the
               Holy Book sheweth us all his simplicity in one word: <quote><persName>Jacob</persName> was a simple man
               dwelling in a tent.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n92-1"/> And, moreover, by reason of his simplicity he would
               never have meditated the stealing of the birthright unless his mother <persName>Rebecca</persName> had
               taught him; but when he heard of the matter which would help [him] he was persuaded
               in the simplicity of his mind and was not stubborn. And that no man may imagine that
               his simplicity was natural foolishness, see how attentive he was to the curses of his
               father, and how he returned answer concerning the things which were set forth by
               knowledge, <quote>Behold, <persName>Esau</persName> my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
               Peradventure my father will feel me, and I shall be in his eyes as a mocker, and
               curses shall come upon me and not blessings.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n92-2"/> But his mother in faith, being
               certain of those early promises which were revealed to her, and of those things which
               were spoken to her when she went to enquire of the Lord, and it had been told her,
               <quote>The elder shall be a servant to the <pb n="93"/>younger,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n93-1"/> made answer unto
               him, saying, <quote>Upon me be thy curses, my son, only hear my voice, and do what I
               command thee;</quote> and straightway he was obedient to his mother like a child. And she
               prepared and gave to <persName>Isaac</persName> the food which he loved, and she covered <persName>Jacob</persName>'s hands
               and neck, in the places which are near to the touch, with skins of animals; and he in
               his simplicity judged not what would happen to him, but like a child that is set
               before his nurse, who doeth unto him what she wisheth, was that full-grown <pb
                  type="external" n="98"/>man before his mother by reason of his simplicity. And
               again, when he took in the food to his father, that which <persName>Rebecca</persName> had put into his
               mouth he repeated like a child, adding nothing and taking away nothing. And again
               when the time for his marriage had come, he did not venture to draw nigh thereto of
               his own freewill, but in his simpleness he had regard unto his father's commands. Now
               <persName>Esau</persName>, like a man crafty for wickedness, because he wished to vex and grieve his
               father and mother in return for their having dealt deceitfully with him, went and
               took wives<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n93-2"/> from the daughters of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, who were continually embittering
               the spirit of <persName>Isaac</persName> and <persName>Rebecca</persName>. And when he perceived that the hatred of his
               parents towards him increased because of the perpetual strivings of his wives, and
               seeing that he could not be deprived of [his] material inheritance—now he considered
               this also with craftiness—he went and took [another] wife, <persName>Basemath</persName>, the daughter
               of <persName>Ishmael</persName>, as one might say, <pb n="94"/>with the wound he took a plaster. And he
               did not do this like an understanding son who was penitent for the things which he
               had wrought previously, but only because he was afraid lest <persName>Isaac</persName> would not
               proclaim him [heir] to that inheritance of riches and possessions which he loved,
               even as he was also vexed by reason of [the loss of] the birthright and the
               blessings, not because he had lost the spiritual promises which were therein, but
               because he had been deprived of the larger part of the riches which the firstborn are
               wont to receive, and because he saw that his father's love, through which he expected
               to receive the larger part <pb type="external" n="99"/>of his riches as an
               inheritance, was changed. Now all these acts of <persName>Esau</persName> teach whosoever knoweth how to
               regard them [aright] concerning his craftiness and wickedness; but with these things
               we are also able to discover in this place the simplicity of <persName>Isaac</persName> their father.
               For although his whole love was turned to <persName>Esau</persName>, and he loved him as his firstborn,
               immediately he perceived the dispensation of God which is above nature, and <persName>Rebecca</persName>
               had gone in to him and revealed what had been spoken to her when she went to enquire
               of the Lord, immediately [I say,] was his love changed from <persName>Esau</persName>, and he directed
               it towards <persName>Jacob</persName> who was worthy thereof.</p>
            <p>And let us also observe the obedience of <persName>Jacob</persName>, who was persuaded by his parents in
               everything like a child. <quote>If <persName>Jacob</persName> also thus shall take wives of the daughters of
               <placeName>Canaan</placeName>,</quote> said <persName>Rebecca</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n94-1"/> <quote>what good shall my life do me? And <persName>Isaac</persName> called
               to <persName>Jacob</persName> and commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take unto thyself a wife from
               the daughters of the Canaanites. But <pb n="95"/>go unto <persName>Laban</persName>, the son of
               <persName>Bethuel</persName>, thy mother's brother, and take thee a wife from thence;</quote> and he was
               obedient and went forth readily, and became suddenly a stranger to all the good
               things of his father's house. And like an alien who possessed nothing he began [to
               travel] the path of his journey, and he asked from them for his need nothing, neither
               beast for burden, nor servants for ministration, nor costly apparel in which to
               appear, nor other things which are a vain show, to which many hold fast to-day, but
               he went forth from them with his staff, <pb type="external" n="100"/>being provided
               for the journey, and bearing blessings and promises of good things instead of these
               things of mankind. And his words also make [this] known unto us, for in giving thanks
               unto God for the things which he had, and entreating to be delivered from his
               brother, [he saith], <quote>With my staff [only] I passed over this <placeName>Jordan</placeName>, and now I
               have become two companies; deliver me from the hands of <persName>Esau</persName>, my brother, for I am
               afraid of him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95-1"/> Let us listen also unto the words which he spake in that
               country in which God was revealed unto him, for from them we may especially see his
               simplicity: <quote>Verily there is the Lord in this place, and I knew it not.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n95-2"/>
               Didst thou think, O simple <persName>Jacob</persName>, that God was limited only to the country in which
               thy parents lived, and that He did not reveal Himself or make Himself manifest in
               every place to those who are worthy of His revelation? And let us consider also how
               many times his wages were changed while he lived with <persName>Laban</persName>, even as at the end his
               words rebuked that crafty man: <quote>Thou hast changed my hire <pb n="96"/>ten times, but
               the Lord hath not suffered thee to harm me.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n96-1"/> And again when he served him for
               his younger daughter, <persName>Laban</persName> took the other in her stead and brought her in to him,
               and led him astray in his simplicity, and he perceived [it] not; and when he asked by
               word or mouth why this deception had been perpetrated upon him, immediately a
               plausible excuse was offered to him—even though it was a lying one —his simplicity
               listened thereto and accepted it. And how many times did <persName>Laban</persName> in his wickedness
               seek to oppress <persName>Jacob</persName>, and how many times did he through his cruelty and cunning
               change his acts towards him with manifold schemes <pb type="external" n="101"/>and
               tricks! But <persName>Jacob</persName>'s innocency was not disturbed, and his simplicity was not
               agitated, and his integrity was not made crafty; and so long as he himself was
               watchful concerning the things which related to himself, so long also was God mindful
               of the things which concerned him. This is the proof of enlightened doctrine to every
               one who wisheth to serve the Lord: his thoughts must not cease from meditation upon
               God, or occupy themselves with artful schemes and inventions wherewith he may do harm
               to his enemies. Do thou, O disciple, abide in the sincerity of thy mind, for it
               belongeth to the Lord to know how He will direct thy life, and the things which are
               beneficial for thee those will He perform for thee. Though thou hear of some who are
               ready to act wickedly towards thee, and of others who dwell in ambush to take away
               thy life, and of others who are become workers to overthrow thy building, and of
               others who blacken thy fair fame and vilify thy manner of life, and of others <pb
                  n="97"/>who dig deep that they may cast thee down from the height upon which thou
               standest, and of others who make signs of detraction at thee, and of others who speak
               against thee with scorn and who pour out against thee blasphemies with mockery, and
               of others by whom thou art made a proverb and a byword, and of others whose whole
               conversation is curses of thee; in spite of all these things do thou abide in thy
               simplicity. And turn not backwards from that country to which thy gaze is directed,
               and cease not from thy hidden converse with God, and let not the power of the things
               which are without thee overcome the power of the hidden anchor upon which hangeth thy
               life, but keep fast hold upon the hope that <persName>Christ</persName> cannot lie, according to
               <persName>Paul</persName>'s counsel<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n97-1"/> <pb type="external" n="102"/>to us, <quote>To lay hold of the hope
               which is promised to us; which we have as an anchor fixed in our soul that it may not
               be moved.</quote> For as the anchor which is cast down [into the sea] by its weight holdeth
               fast and restraineth the ship in the waves that it may not wander and drift away out
               of its proper course, so also is the hope which is promised to us in heaven, and
               which is the hidden anchor which is set above us, and is sunk and hidden from us in
               the heaven of heavens; let us make fast our minds to it, and let us fasten the ship
               of our soul thereto that it may not shift about and be disturbed by the storms and
               waves of the world which beat upon it, and drift out of its proper course. In spite
               of the things which thou hearest abide thou in thy simplicity, and let not those who
               speak against thee change thee and make thee to become like unto them. </p>
            <pb n="98"/>
            <p>For the <persName>Adversary</persName> gathereth together all these things for this reason and setteth
               them in array against thee to turn thy mind from its state of happiness, and to
               disturb and trouble thy innocency, to make crafty thy simplicity, to make thee like
               unto those who fight against thee, to fill thee with anger like unto them, to make
               thee a vessel of wrath like unto them, and to clothe thee with the dress of
               wickedness. And when thy mind hath descended from that state of simplicity which
               looketh at one [thing] alone, and thou directest thy gaze upon many, and thou hearest
               the things which are spoken against thee, through these the Adversary will find thee
               as he desireth, and thou wilt become easy of access to him, and a ready and easy
               prey; but do thou persist in thy simplicity which is a vessel of righteousness. For
               as a material vessel <pb type="external" n="103"/>becometh a receptacle of what we
               put therein, so also is simplicity a pure and honourable vessel which receiveth the
               various forms of righteousness.</p>
            <p>Now therefore let <persName>Jacob</persName> the simple man, whose history I have depicted for thee, be
               a type of the things of which I have spoken to thee, and when words of strife are
               stirred up to disturb thy simplicity, and thou art sensible of the snares of <persName>the
               Enemy</persName> which would trip thee up, think upon this blessed man, and consider all his
               history from the beginning to the end—for for this reason these things and others
               like unto them were written in the Scriptures—and let them be a support to thy soul
               which is tottering to a fall, and a consolation to [thy] thoughts which are filled
               with sadness by reason of the indignation of him that stirreth up anger. Observe how
               much <persName>Esau</persName> and <persName>Laban</persName> plotted to do harm unto <persName>Jacob</persName>, but the Lord followed after
                  <pb n="99"/>him in all his actions; and while <persName>Jacob</persName> remained quiet and took no
               pains to meet the schemes of his enemies, God turned their crafty devices backwards,
               and instead of a changing series of losses He brought gain upon him. For <persName>Jacob</persName> was
               occupied in his integrity, and God sought out good things for him; <persName>Jacob</persName> busied
               himself wholly in every work like a child in his simplicity, and the Lord in His
               wisdom made his paths to prosper. <persName>Laban</persName> plotted schemes whereby he might cause him
               loss, and <persName>Jacob</persName> perceived it not, that simple man felt it not, and that innocent
               man knew it not; but in his stead God saw and knew everything, and what <pb
                  type="external" n="104"/><persName>Laban</persName> had bound, the Lord loosed. <persName>Laban</persName> contrived a
               scheme of loss against <persName>Jacob</persName> and the Highest scattered [it]: he made an invention
               which would increase his own possession and diminish that of <persName>Jacob</persName>, and God made
               another invention against it. While <persName>Jacob</persName> remained at peace the Judge became his
               advocate, and while he journeyed on in his works innocently God in His wisdom
               directed his paths. These things [concerning] <persName>Jacob</persName> were written for thee, and they
               belong to thee if thou wilt abide in the simplicity of the mind of <persName>Jacob</persName>, and in
               the sincerity of soul of that simple man; for the simple belong unto the Lord. Be not
               ashamed of simplicity, for the cunning and the crafty are vessels of <persName>the Adversary</persName>;
               desire not and lust not after cunning, for cunning is the ground which produceth
               wickedness, and simplicity is the field which maketh righteousness to bring forth
               fruit. For this reason, in all places, the Lord speaketh with simplicity, and in it
               His Will abideth, and it becometh a dwelling-place and a receptacle of His
               revelations. </p>
            <p>For <persName>Eli</persName> was sleeping with his sons inside the temple, <pb n="100"/>and when the
               Lord desired to speak with the children of men, He forsook the old age which was
               trained in wisdom and exercised in the affairs of the world, and lusty manhood which
               had received the cunning of evil things, and came to simplicity and spake with it,
               and chose converse with it. <quote>The Lord called to <persName>Samuel</persName>, 
                  <quote><persName>Samuel</persName>, <persName>Samuel</persName>,</quote>
               twice;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n100-1"/> and simplicity rose up and ran to old age, and the child knew not who
               it was that called him; and he ran to give an answer to <persName>Eli</persName> instead of to God, <pb
                  type="external" n="105"/>and he did this three times, because he had not yet had
               experience of divine revelations. Now when <persName>Eli</persName> understood that it was the Lord Who
               had called him, he commanded him to make answer as unto the Lord, and not to run
               towards him; for <persName>Eli</persName> understood that the Lord had called the boy.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n100-2"/> And
               old age sent youth to the Lord to learn His will, and cunning had need of simplicity
               that by means of it it might learn the Divine Will; for <persName>Eli</persName> entreated <persName>Samuel</persName> and
               begged him to reveal to him everything which he had heard from the Lord, and not to
               hide anything from him. And because he perceived that he himself was unworthy to
               speak with the Lord, he offered entreaty to the child to reveal to him the Divine
               mystery; and between Divinity and knowledge simplicity became an interpreter, and
               childhood received and made answer, and to a child only a few years old, who was
               unacquainted with the arrangement of the affairs of men, was the knowledge of God
               revealed. For the Lord dwelleth in the upright, and with the simple ones He speaketh;
               and He chooseth the sincere, who having learnt the word do <pb n="101"/>not consider
               that it is their own, but they recognize Him that spake it, and to Him they return
               gratitude. And the word of God doth not become to them the material for pride and
               vain boasting, and they are not exalted by the things of God as if they were their
               own, and they say not, The word of wisdom which we have is our own. Now these simple
               and upright ones never consider [that it is their own], but in their simplicity they
               confess that what they have belongeth to the Lord; <pb type="external" n="106"/>and
               for this reason we have found in all places that God rejected cunning and chose
               simplicity. For because the man wise in the spirit, that is, the man who hath by the
               experience of his soul obtained the taste of the knowledge of life, is not easily
               found, his simplicity of nature is acceptable unto God; for this is His own gift and
               the first thing formed in our nature, for when God created us in the beginning He
               placed simplicity within us. So therefore simplicity is placed in [our] midst, and
               one riseth therefrom to the doctrine of spiritual things and becometh a wise man of
               the spirit, and another cometh down therefrom to the doctrine and training of the
               things of this world, and such an one is called crafty and cunning. For if men should
               be called according to the exact name of things, those who are exercised and whose
               whole training is in corporeal things would not be called wise, and those whose
               simplicity hath been trained in spiritual things would not be called crafty and
               cunning; but those who have collected their knowledge from the world would be called
               crafty and cunning, while those who have been exercised in spiritual things would be
               called wise and understanding men, for wisdom belongeth to God alone and to the man
               whose quest is God. </p>
            <pb n="102"/>
            <p>The knowledge of the world is not worthy to be called wisdom, rightly speaking, nor
               can the wisdom of God be said to be cunning and craftiness by the understanding of
               discretion, for in this wisdom there is no scheming, and it is not stablished by the
               composition of various opinions. It passeth the power of speech [to say] why <pb
                  type="external" n="107"/>God delighteth in simplicity, and why He chooseth it
               rather than the wisdom of the world, for behold the wisdom of the world is the gift
               of God, even as <persName>the apostle</persName> said, <quote>By the wisdom of God the world knew not the
               wisdom of God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n102-1"/> And for this reason it is well known that if wisdom were not
               in us from the time when we were framed and made—and wisdom is not implanted in
               everything that hath been made—we should not be able to gather together wisdom from
               the world. Behold then also the wisdom of the world is the gift of God, and why then
               hath He rejected it and chosen simplicity? It is well known that the reason is
               because our own labour is therein, and because it is collected from those who possess
               it, whose vision is directed to the world and not to God, and who run thereafter that
               they may be thought to be wise men in the opinion [of men]. And to speak finally, the
               human passions weary themselves when they gather themselves together and seek this
               wisdom among things which have been made, and in that they have united labours to
               their quest, and the trouble and afflictions of their persons to the discovery of
               this knowledge, they imagine that it belongeth to them when they consider how they
               have laboured for its sake. For this reason the Lord rejected the wise men of the
               world and chose the simple ones <pb n="103"/>in their stead. And moreover, inasmuch
               as the wisdom of the world is the opposite of the Divine wisdom in every respect, and
               there is no means whereby they may be mingled with one another, even as light cannot
               be mingled with darkness, so also if a man wish to obtain from the wise men of the
               world <pb type="external" n="108"/>knowledge of the things of the Spirit he must
               first of all cast off from him the thoughts of that wisdom, and the whole expectation
               of his previous knowledge, and he must stand at the beginning of the path of the
               first step which is simplicity, and childlike disposition, and the faith which
               heareth and receiveth with simpleness. And then he may begin the journey of the path
               of the wisdom of Christ and set out on his course, and if he be zealous to march on
               wisdom itself will shew him the way.</p>
            <p>Simplicity then is the gift of nature, and it belongeth to the Creator, and nothing
               belonging to us is mingled therein, that is to say, nothing of our will and nothing
               of our work. Therefore its gift dwelleth in His gift, and His wisdom abideth in the
               place which He hath constructed, even as it also stooped [to dwell] with <persName>Samuel</persName>; it
               forsook subtlety and spake with him, and the chief priesthood and came to him. And
               behold the Holy Book doth not blame <persName>Eli</persName> for much wickedness, but only because he
               was remiss, and because he chid not his sons. Now <persName>Eli</persName> himself was not a
               participator in their iniquity, and if any man should say that he acted in his youth
               as they did [we must remember] that the Book doth not accuse him of this, neither
               doth it say, <quote>Thou didst do wickedly in this manner in thy youth, and now thy sons do
               like unto thee;</quote> but the Lord said to <persName>Samuel</persName>, <quote>Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
               at which both the ears of everyone that <pb n="104"/>heareth it shall
               tingle,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104-1"/> because <persName>Eli</persName> had heard of the iniquity which his sons were doing
               in the tabernacle, and had rebuked them not. Now the whole accusation of <persName>Eli</persName> arose
               because of his negligence, <pb type="external" n="109"/>and because his rebuke was
               not commensurate with the wickedness of his sons: for it is written that he rebuked
               them,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104-2"/> but the rebuke was feeble and ineffectual, and not one which the
               serious nature of the iniquity demanded. His negligence alone and not his own
               wickedness, was the sole object of the condemnation of <persName>Eli</persName> the priest, and although
               the matter was thus yet God chose youth rather than him, and He made His conversation
               with childhood and simplicity. For as the Book maketh known,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104-3"/> <persName>Samuel</persName> was
               brought up in the temple of the Lord, as were <persName>Joshua the son of <persName>Nun</persName></persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104-4"/> and
               <persName>Jacob</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104-5"/> for these also were reared in the tent, even as our discourse hath
               shewed above.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n104-6"/> And it is a thing to wonder at how the Lord called what He had
               formed from these two places, whether it be those who were accustomed to the
               wilderness, or those who were brought up in the tent, for in both these places
               simplicity was to be acquired. For behold God set apart from the wilderness <persName>David</persName>,
               and <persName>Moses</persName>, and many others for His dispensation, but <persName>Samuel</persName>, and <persName>Joshua</persName>, and
               <persName>Jacob</persName> He chose from the bringing up in the tabernacle (i. e., tent). Behold then,
               from this also we may know that simplicity is beloved of God, and that it was the
               beginning of the way of those who drew nigh unto God. And moreover, we may also see
               simplicity in <persName>Abel</persName>, <pb n="105"/>and the Holy Book sheweth us that he was more
               simple than <persName>Cain</persName>; for they both brought offerings to the Lord,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n105-1"/> and the
               offering of simplicity was accepted, but the offering of wickedness was rejected. And
               <persName>Cain</persName> was angry with the Lord and with <persName>Abel</persName>; <pb type="external" n="110"/>with
               <persName>Abel</persName> because he envied him, and with the Lord because He had rejected his offering.
               If he had been of a simple disposition he would not have been envious, and if he had
               been sincere he would not have been angry with the Lord. And moreover we may see the
               cunning of Cain from the outlet which he found for his wickedness, for when he
               meditated slaying <persName>Abel</persName> his brother, and was not able to do it because he was near
               unto his parents, he said <quote>Let us go down into the plain;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n105-2"/> and <persName>Abel</persName>, in
               his innocency, heard and was persuaded like a child. And his simplicity imagined not
               wickedness, and he did not consider in his heart why <persName>Cain</persName> called him to the plain,
               neither did he perceive <persName>Cain</persName>'s hatred towards him, because simplicity knoweth not
               how to be a spectator of these things; but in the innocency of his heart and in
               brotherly love towards him he turned, and whithersoever he called him he [went]
               readily and obediently. And observe here also the works of simplicity, and have
               regard unto the injurious effects of cunning and wickedness, and be strenuous to be
               on the side of the simple, who have at all times pleased God; and reject cunning as
               something which is unfit for thee, and which is not meet for the discipleship in
               which thou standest. For as the apparel which befitteth thy rank in life is well
               known, and if thou puttest on that which is contrary hereto thou wilt become a <pb
                  n="106"/>laughing-stock, so also the apparel of simplicity is meet for thee, and
               if thou puttest on that of cunning thou wilt be condemned by the wise and
               understanding, and the feast will not receive thee [arrayed] in this apparel. </p>
            <pb type="external" n="111"/>
            <p>And with these men let us also consider <persName>Joseph</persName> the chaste, whose honour towards his
               father and whose love towards his brethren were born of simplicity; for his brethren
               were envious of him and he perceived it not, they devised murder against him and he
               knew it not, and [when] his father told him to go and visit his brethren, he obeyed
               him readily. He saw dreams which made known his own greatness and their subjection,
               and in his simplicity he drew nigh and revealed unto them their subjection; the
               simple man did not perceive that cunning would add to its wickedness, nor that hatred
               [of him] would be increased in his brethren by the hearing of these things. And when
               the old man <persName>Jacob</persName> saw the simplicity of his son <persName>Joseph</persName>, he rebuked him [and told
               him] not to reveal [it], not because he was not certain of what would happen, for the
               Book saith<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n106-1"/> that he kept all these things because he believed that they were
               about to take place; but he rebuked the simplicity of <persName>Joseph</persName> in order that he might
               not increase the hatred of his brethren by the revealing of his dreams. He bore and
               was carrying food to them, and he passed from place to place asking for them; and he
               did not know that in running to his brethren he was running to murderers. He saw
               them, and in his simplicity he was filled with joy, but they when they saw him [were
               filled] with gloom and anger. <pb n="107"/>And while simplicity was meditating good
               things, and increasing love at the sight of the brethren, the envy which cunning
               brought forth grew the more strong, and increased, and meditated murder; and they
               plotted wickedness and they wrought wickedness. But see the end of the two [sides],
               and observe with which <pb type="external" n="112"/>God was well pleased. While that
               simplicity which did not know how to hide its dreams was mounted upon a chariot of
               honour, craftiness was cast down upon the ground before it, and simplicity gave the
               command, and craftiness was obedient thereto. Simplicity was increased by the wisdom
               of God, and craftiness added wickedness to itself. <quote>I have seen that there is none
               who is so wise and understanding as thyself,</quote> said the king of Egypt<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n107-1"/> to that
               simple man. For simplicity is nigh unto wisdom, and the understanding of God is akin
               to integrity, and simplicity is the vessel which receiveth the divine revelations.
               Now the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> also wisely rejected cunning, saying, <quote>We walk not in
               craftiness, and we handle not the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation
               of the truth we shew ourselves before all the consciences of the children of
               men.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n107-2"/> And behold, <persName>Paul</persName> also hath taught thee that deceit is closely joined
               to cunning and that it is the vessel of all wickednesses, and for this reason he also
               fled therefrom. And who is the disciple who will not reject it if <persName>the apostle</persName>
               rejected it and cast it forth, and made it a thing alien to the pure doctrine of
               <persName>Christ</persName>, which befitted him not? For as wickedness is the opposite of good, so also
               is cunning the opposite of simplicity. And in another place <persName>Paul</persName> writeth to his
               disciples, </p>
            <p><quote>Per<pb n="108"/>adventure like a crafty man I have carried you off with
               guile;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n108-1"/> and here also he closely uniteth guile with cunning. <pb
                  type="external" n="113"/>And again in another speech he condemneth the heretics
               and sheweth that all their doctrine standeth in cunning. <quote>Let us not be children,
               tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of the deceitful doctrines of the
               children of men, who in their cunning act craftily to lead astray; but let us be firm
               in our love that we may make to grow up everything of ours in <persName>Christ</persName></quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n108-2"/> And
               moreover <persName>our Lord</persName> also maketh known that heretics are cunning and crafty, for He
               said, <quote>Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly
               are ravening wolves;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n108-3"/> and [He maketh known] also, that when a man appeareth
               to be one thing and is another, he is a worker of cunning. To appear in sheep's
               clothing, being actually wolves, was taught unto them by cunning; for cunning
               ministereth unto two things, it maketh wickedness to grow, and it maketh wickedness
               to increase, and moreover, it schemeth how it may teach itself to others. Where it is
               meet to hide, it hideth, and where it knoweth that it is meet to reveal, it
               revealeth; for wickedness is blind, but cunning hath eyes. And again in another place
               <persName>our Lord</persName> taught His disciples to beware of the cunning of the Pharisees and
               Sadducees, saying, <quote>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, and
               of the leaven of <persName>Herod</persName>;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n108-4"/> and thou mayest know that He here calleth cunning
               and wickedness by the name of leaven, <pb type="external" n="114"/>
               <pb n="109"/>because in another place when the Pharisees said <quote><persName>Herod</persName> desireth to
               kill thee,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n109-1"/> <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>He</corr></choice> called <persName>Herod</persName> a fox because of his cunning, saying,
               <quote>Go ye and say to this fox</quote>—for because he hath no power to do what he desireth by
               authority, behold he contriveth artful schemes and plots in order that cunning may
               take the place of power, even as cunning taketh the place of strength in the fox—<quote>by
               My own freewill will I go, but thy cunning which is outside My freewill, is not able
               to make Me go forth. To-day and to-morrow I work miracles, and the third day I am
               perfected.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n109-2"/> Behold then <persName>our Lord</persName> warned His disciples against the cunning
               of <persName>Herod</persName> and the wickedness of the Pharisees, because while they were doing one
               thing they taught another. <persName>Our Lord</persName> did not bid them beware of the doctrine of
               <persName>Moses</persName> which the Pharisees taught, but of their traditions which they invented in
               their cunning that they might be material for the merchandise of iniquity; and of
               their feigning to be righteous before the children of men; and of their being careful
               of the honour of God while in their secret works they belittled Him; and of their
               making long their prayers in order to devour widow's houses; and of their disfiguring
               their countenances that they might appear to be men who fasted; and of their washing
               the outside of the cup and platter—that is to say, they beautified and made fair the
               parts of them which were manifest—being filled within with iniquity and all impurity;
               and of their adorning their persons outside with a reverent and venerable demeanour
               to be observed with the eye, being secretly filled with rapine, and deceit, and <pb
                  n="110"/>wantonness, and the desire for all <pb type="external" n="115"/>objects
               of lust.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n110-1"/> Of all this doctrine then of the Pharisees <persName>our Lord</persName> commanded His
               disciples to beware.</p>
            <p>All these things which arise from deceit, and which are wrought under a false
               disguise are born of cunning. Why then instead of these things did <persName>our Lord</persName> command
               His disciples to be harmless as doves in respect of good things, and cunning as
               serpents,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n110-2"/> in respect of evil things? towards faith [that they should offer]
               simplicity, and against error that they should oppose craftiness? It was in order
               that the upright might save their life, and that the crafty might not destroy it. For
               for the acquiring of virtues simplicity must be employed by us; but that we may not
               perish craft is necessary for us; towards God sincerity of mind (or conscience), and
               towards the children of men, who plot to take away from us the things of God,
               craftiness of thought. So then well did <persName>our Lord</persName> command us to be harmless as
               doves<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n110-2"/> towards each other and towards Him, and crafty as serpents towards
               those who scheme to deprive us of spiritual things. For even the craftiness of the
               serpent is [directed] against the man, and not against itself, and it delivereth its
               body to blows by the craftiness of its nature, but it guardeth its head from injury,
               for from it death is transmitted throughout its entire length.</p>
            <p>And again to the disciples who asked craftily which should be greatest in the kingdom
               of heaven, and who lusted with crafty mind to rise a step above the others, He taught
               the simplicity of children, in whom there is no desire for dominion and rule, and
               whose <pb n="111"/>thought hath never experienced the love of the honour of the
               world. <quote>Verily I say <pb type="external" n="116"/> unto you, that except ye be
               converted and become childlike and simple as children ye shall not enter into the
               kingdom of heaven.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n111-1"/> And again, <quote>Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
               God like a child</quote>—with uprightness of heart and simplicity—<quote>shall not enter
               therein.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n111-2"/> And again <persName>Paul</persName> also taught concerning this simplicity that we
               should not only make use of it towards God, and towards each other, but he also
               commandeth the servants of this world to honour their masters in simplicity, without
               deceit and without cunning. <quote>Servants, be obedient to your masters in all things, not
               with eye-service as those who please the children of men, but with fear and
               trembling, and with the simpleness of heart as unto <persName>Christ</persName>.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n111-3"/> And again he
               also commanded the Jews that simplicity should be found with them in their gifts. <quote>He
               that giveth [let him do it] with simplicity; and he that standeth at the head, [let
               him rule] with diligence.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n111-4"/> For if cunning be found among those who give they
               become spies of the affairs of those who receive, and for this cause the gift which
               simplicity would give without thought is kept back. Now it is the custom of
               simplicity not to think and then to give, but to all men it divideth and giveth
               abundantly. And again, <persName>our Lord</persName> taught this simplicity when He said, <quote>Give unto
               every one that asketh of thee;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n111-5"/> and again Paul himself prayed for those who
               give that the fruits of their righteousness might be increased, <pb n="112"/>and that
               they might distribute gifts to the needy with simplicity, <pb type="external" n="117"
               /><quote>May that God Who giveth seed to the sowers, and bread for food, multiply your
               seed, and increase the fruits of your righteousness; that ye may be enriched in
               everything in all simplicity, which perfecteth by our hand thanksgiving to
               God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n112-1"/> And behold here also in simplicity <persName>Paul</persName> prayeth for his disciples
               that they may be enriched, and that therefrom, he saith, thanksgiving towards God may
               increase and wax strong. And again he saith, <quote>Ye have become obedient to the
               confession of the Gospel of <persName>Christ</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n112-2"/> and ye have become subject with them
               and with every man in your simplicity.</quote> And again he saith, <quote>I fear lest, as the
               serpent led <persName>Eve</persName> astray in its guile, your mind should be corrupted from the
               simplicity that is towards <persName>Christ</persName>;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n112-3"/> and here again he teacheth us that
               whosoever believeth in <persName>Christ</persName>, it is meet for him to abide in His doctrine. And he
               sheweth us also by [his] words that until <persName>Eve</persName> had forsaken simplicity towards the
               commandment of God she did not receive the guile of the cunning of the Tempter. And
               moreover, that [kiss of] peace which at the end of all his Epistles <persName>Paul</persName> commandeth
               his disciples to give one another, is born of simplicity, and sincerity of mind
               giveth it. <quote>We live by the Spirit, and by the Spirit let us come to an end. Let us
               not be vainglorious, provoking one another, and envying one another.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n112-4"/> And
               that a man should live by the Spirit and come to an end by the Spirit cometh to a man
               by simplicity and innocency of mind. </p>
            <pb n="113"/>
            <p>Now therefore it is good that the disciples of <persName>Christ</persName> should follow after
               simplicity, and that they should have regard unto innocency of mind; <pb
                  type="external" n="118"/>and let us not be envious of those who are cunning in
               respect of wickedness, and who are crafty to obtain the honours and pleasures of the
               world. For behold we may learn from all the books of the Old and New Testaments that
               in simplicity man draweth nigh unto God, and that simplicity becometh the
               dwelling-place of God; and together with the doctrine of the books the actual
               experience of affairs sheweth that righteousness is nearer unto simplicity than unto
               cunning. For although the cunning and the crafty may do works, and appear to lead the
               life of righteousness, yet are they held fast by other passions, and for this reason
               they persevere in labours that they may nourish the evil passions which are stirred
               up in their souls, whether it be honour or glory or power which they scheme to pursue
               by their life of labours. Now simplicity hath not such ideas in the service of its
               labours, for it is led by the beautiful law wherewith it is held fast, or by the fear
               which it putteth not away, or by love towards God which guardeth it in its
               afflictions, if it happen that it hath come to this, for as far as is the capacity of
               love fear guardeth and supporteth simplicity.</p>
            <p>Therefore be not ashamed, O disciple, of this good gift, but lay hold upon it from
               the beginning of thy discipleship unto the end thereof, and in all good things let it
               be found with thee; for by simplicity and faith thou hast hearkened unto God, and
               hast gone forth from the world, and thou hast not judged and examined therewith into
               the things which He spake to thee. For if thou hadst been cunning thou wouldst not
               have listened unto Him, and if thou hadst inclined thine ear unto <pb n="114"/>His
               word with thoughts of craftiness thou wouldst not have gone forth after God who
               called thee, neither <pb type="external" n="119"/>would any of those who have been
               called and who have been obedient unto God have hearkened unto His word and gone
               forth after His command when He called them to go forth after Him, nor would they
               have been ministers of His dispensation in any form towards the children of men. For
               from natural simplicity is born the abundance of the spiritual mind. And observe that
               the simple mind is able to receive the learning of this world also, for a very young
               and simple child accepteth the learning of the world and feareth [his] masters, but
               in proportion as he increaseth in stature and becometh crafty in the things of the
               children of men, he despiseth [his] masters, and esteemeth learning lightly. And thus
               also doth simplicity receive spiritual learning, being filled with fear of the
               <persName>Teacher</persName>, and being watchful not to forget [His] instruction. And if any man wisheth
               to draw nigh to craftiness and therefrom to things which are to be desired, he
               immediately despiseth instruction, and holdeth God in contempt. Let us then lay hold
               upon and be watchful of this good gift, and let the whole course of our life and
               conduct be in sincerity of heart. Let us reject craftiness and be remote from
               cunning; let us rebuke wickedness and be watchful against guile; let us be remote
               from artifice, and let us flee from <persName>the Calumniator</persName>; and let us cast away from us
               the tongue which smiteth in secret. And with a simple understanding and innocent mind
               let us give praises unto the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for ever,
               Amen.</p>
