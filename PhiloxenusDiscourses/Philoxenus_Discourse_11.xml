            <head type="title">The Eleventh Discourse: on abstinence and the subjection of the body,
               which sheweth that a man is, through tribulations, able to enter into the spiritual
               country of the enjoyments of the knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>.</head>
            <p><quote>Enter ye in at the strait gate,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n403-1"/> proclaimeth the word of <persName>the Redeemer</persName>
               unto all true disciples of His word, for without this gate a man cannot enter into
               the kingdom of God. For a man is not wholly worthy of the experience of the rule and
               life of <persName>Christ</persName> until he hath put to an end in him all feeling for the meats of the
               world, and he is not able to cut off and to cast away from him this affection, except
               through the power of patience he cut off [from himself] pleasure in all things which
               are lusted after. For when a man hath cut off and cast away wickedness from his soul,
               all good and fair things spring up within him in its place, that is to say, in the
               place from which evil hath been cut off good straightway springeth up therein, and
               blossometh. And as all the power of the soul <pb type="external" n="421"/>turneth to
               water and to make to grow that plant, even so is the power of all the thoughts wholly
               directed to make to grow the tree of goodness, which is planted <pb n="404"/>in the
               soul after wickedness hath been uprooted therefrom; for if vices be not rooted up
               virtues cannot blossom, and except evil habits be cut off and cast away from us, the
               tradition of a good life layeth not hold upon us, and unless we have forsaken
               slackness we cannot lay hold upon fortitude, and except gluttony hath died,
               abstinence cannot live in us. For death and life are ministered <choice><sic>unto in</sic><corr>unto</corr></choice> us in
               two things: the death of the old man, which is abominable lusts, and the life of the
               new man, which is a correct rule of life. Now the death which is man's penalty did
               the commandment bring, but the death which ariseth from the lusts He calleth the will
               of each one of us, because also from the beginning the death which is of sin entered
               in by [man's] will, and afterwards came the death which arose from the penalty by the
               will of God. And so also is it in this case: for before the dissolution of the nature
               of the body which dissolveth the penalty, the will of each one of us is able to
               scatter the composition of the old man of lusts, and when this death hath been
               dissolved not even then is that nature firm.</p>
            <p>Now the death which is of sin brought in the death which is of nature, and with the
               dissolution of the one, the other was brought to nought, and those who did not die
               aforetime died in very truth, but those, who of their own freewill put to death in
               them the man of lusts in this death, dissolved the death of the natural man; <pb
                  type="external" n="422"/>therefore it is well that we should die before our death,
               that we may also live before our life. For where the death of the will goeth first,
               the death which is of nature is dissolved, and where the death which is of nature is
               dissolved aforetime by the dominion of freewill before we come into life, the man who
               dieth <pb n="405"/>is alive; and because these cessations and renewings happen unto
               us aforetime in all ways, it is seemly for us first of all to uproot wickedness, and
               then to lay in ourselves the foundation of the edifice of virtues, in order that the
               rock may receive our foundation, as it is written,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n405-1"/> and that on a sure stone
               may be our building, even as it is said. And in this respect we should be like unto
               the physicians of [our] nature who, until they have removed and cleansed the matter
               from the sore, do not lay [upon it] the plaster which buildeth up and maketh to grow
               the living flesh; and so must it be with us also when we have uprooted the matter of
               the lust of the belly, and have made accusations against its filthy and loathsome
               forms.</p>
            <p>And now let us shew in our discourse the benefit of abstinence, and let us exhort
               disciples with profitable doctrine to lay hold in their souls upon this endurance
               which, although it is imagined to be laden with labours, is nevertheless the
               birth-pang which giveth us birth into the experience of the blessings of <persName>Christ</persName>.
               And as the child is born into the world through the pains of her that giveth him
               birth, even so also through the pains of sufferings and the patient endurance of
               labours is a man born into the world of the knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>. And if a man were
               to call abstinence the cleansing of the lusts of the body he would not err, for as
                  <pb type="external" n="423"/>the body is purified by washing from the things which
               pollute it, and which conceal its natural appearance and colour, even so also through
               abstinence are the blemishes of the old man healed, and made clean, and the beauty of
               the new man, <pb n="406"/>cleansed and pure, is revealed, and when he hath been
               revealed and re-standeth in the appearance of his nature, then is it easy for him to
               see and be seen in the beauty of his soul from whence he receiveth the clothing of
               knowledge.</p>
            <p>Now the beginning of abstinence is bitter and severe, but the end thereof is pleasant
               and sweet. Its burden is heavy unto those who do not feel how light it is, and its
               load is difficult unto those who do not look into the spiritual riches which are
               therein, for it is the strait gate which leadeth into the broad country of spiritual
               beings; and as poverty of possessions is the end of the way of the world, even so is
               abstinence the beginning of the path of the rule and life of the Gospel. And it is
               good for us also that, after the discourse upon poverty, we should enter upon the
               doctrine which concerneth abstinence, because in proportion as a man possesseth that
               which is outside of him will he work therein, and therefrom will he gather in the
               produce. And though of his own will he distributeth goodness and lovingkindness, yet
               he taketh from outside of him the seed, and casteth it in the fields of the
               afflicted, or as one might say, he taketh from the world, and giveth thereunto, even
               though the fruits of this righteousness be gathered together unto the person of the
               man himself; but labours are outside the person. For what labour and tribulation will
               arise in the body of him, the righteousness of whose alms are stablished by riches
               which are outside him, <pb type="external" n="424"/>besides this only, that he
               constraineth the thought of the lust of the belly, and bringeth it into subjection
               beneath the will of lovingkindness? But when a man hath emptied himself of
               everything, and he standeth free in the world in his <pb n="407"/>own person, he
               becometh a field of which he himself is the cultivator, and he tilleth it, and soweth
               seed therein, and from it tribulations begin, and in it they come to an end, and
               henceforth he doth not sow strange lands with the seed of alms, but the rational
               field of himself, and in it he beginneth the service of the labours of
               righteousness.</p>
            <p>Now the first rule of this field is the cultivation of fasting and abstinence, for
               without these all the virtues of the person can be but feebly cultivated, and it is
               as if the power [to perform] them were weak and wanting in us; for our prayer cannot
               be pure, nor our singing wakeful, nor our thoughts sanctified, nor our knowledge
               increased, nor our understanding made bright, nor our mind active, nor will our
               hidden man be renewed in wondering admiration at the greatness of the glory of God,
               without the cultivation of fasting and the ministration of abstinence. For from these
               things we go on to others, and we are lifted up from this step unto others which are
               higher, and by reason of resisting meats we arrive at the similitude of angels; for
               inasmuch as the angels exist wholly and entirely without meat, we must of our own
               freewill make ourselves alien unto the meat which is lusted after, and diminish a few
               of the wants of the body. And by this <pb type="external" n="425"/> also we shew that
               we have in us the longing to be like unto spiritual beings. For this reason <persName>our
               Lord</persName> Who came for our redemption was able in His own power immediately He was
               revealed to make us in the likeness of angels—which He is about to make us finally
               according to the riches of His grace—yet He did not do this, but He taught us how a
               man might become like unto the angels, and He left it to our freewill to <pb n="408"
               />hasten after their similitude. Let us then, of our own freewill cast off from us
               the old carnal mindedness, and put on the renewing of the likeness of the angels, and
               let us exchange meat for meat, and lust for lust, and table for table, and food for
               food, and one kind of nourishment for another. For we have a [carnal] belly and a
               [spiritual] belly which receive different kinds of meats, and when a man hath shut
               the door in the face of one, he then openeth the other that it may receive the meats
               of the spirit, and enjoy and live daintily upon the various kinds of spiritual food
               which are above nature; and because our nature was too feeble of itself to cut off
               and to cast out these things from it, the gift of the Spirit came to our support, in
               order that that which nature was not able to do of itself it might complete by
               Grace.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O disciple, contend against the lusts of the body with all thy soul, and
               cultivate virtues in the field of thyself which remaineth to thee from the world, for
               thou thyself alone of every thing which is in the world art reserved <pb
                  type="external" n="426"/>for life, and for thee the wedding chamber is opened, and
               the kingdom prepared, and the place for reclining spread, and the mansions are in
               order, and the table of dainties is made ready in that living feast in which God hath
               made Himself the minister, even as He Himself hath proclaimed unto thee in His sure
               word, <quote>Verily I say unto you that He shall make His chosen ones sit down, and He
               shall gird up His loins and shall go in and minister unto them.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n408-1"/> Be thou
               then [O disciple,] at all times mindful of this table, that from the remembrance
               thereof thou mayest receive strength, and mayest be able to despise the <pb n="409"
               />natural table; for there is no man who would exchange the dainty table of the
               kingdom for the coarse and common table of the bread of wheat, and more than this the
               table of meats of the body is smaller and inferior in comparison to that spiritual
               table.</p>
            <p>Be thou wakeful, then, and watch thyself when this lust beginneth to fight against
               thee, and gather together all the host of thy thoughts, having as the general thereof
               a wakeful understanding, which is like the chief of a band of thieves, who are the
               passion of the lust of the belly. For this lust knoweth that it is too feeble to
               fight against the mind which can endure, and it taketh with it hunger that it may be
               a help thereunto, and that it may shew thee that thy blame will not be very great if
               thou art constrained by thy hunger [and thou eatest]. And it offereth unto thee such
               entreaties as these: <quote>Need of food was implanted in thee by the Creator,</quote> and <quote>Hunger
               naturally ruleth over thy body,</quote> and <quote>The support of thy human life consisteth of
               food, and without it thou canst not abide in the <pb type="external" n="427"/>world,
               and if thou wishest to live without these things thou resistest the will of the
               Creator, Who desired that thy bodily life should be supported in the world in this
               manner; and the meat which is [eaten] by measure, and the drink which is taken in
               moderation are blameless.</quote> And when this lust hath led thee away by these
               blandishments, and hath brought thee from the consideration of, Thou shalt not eat,
               unto that of, Thou shalt eat, it draweth thee on further from, Thou shalt eat, unto
               how thou shalt eat, and what thou shalt eat; for it doth not counsel thee from the
               beginning that thy eating shall be from lust, but it persuadeth thee that thou shalt
               eat for need's sake, and afterwards <pb n="410"/>it leadeth thee on from need unto
               lust. By the power of patient endurance a man standeth when he contendeth to overcome
               the hunger of nature, and if at the season of his power weakness gaineth dominion
               over him, he is easily conquered [and is made] to come to utter defeat when once a
               small portion of that feebleness hath gained the mastery over him.</p>
            <p>Observe then, O thou [disciple], very carefully and with discerning knowledge, that
               not all hunger is the hunger of nature, and that not all meat is the meat which
               satisfieth want, and observe the different kinds of hunger, and distinguish and
               select with knowledge thine own hunger from among them. One kind of hunger belongeth
               to youth, and another ariseth from weakness, and another from excessive emptiness,
               and another from habit, and another from idleness of the thoughts which have nothing
               wherewith to occupy themselves, and another from the feebleness of the thoughts, and
               another from the daily cutting off which happeneth unto the body, and another from
               the coldness of the body which seeketh to be made warm <pb type="external" n="428"
               />by meat, and another which excessive labour produceth; these and such like things
               are the causes of hunger, besides there being some men also whose hunger is not a
               healthy hunger. Therefore many men are able to bear hunger from the beginning of the
               day, and some are an hungered at the second hour, and others at the fourth, and
               others at the sixth, and others at the ninth, and others in the evening, and others
               can endure the hunger of the close of the day until the vigil of the night, and
               others continue to fast until the third hour; and when they have arrived at the
               number of a double vigil their natural hunger hath entirely ceased in them, because
               the natural heat which <pb n="411"/>is stirred up in the body taketh the place of
               meat to them. And when from these things thou dost understand the varieties of hunger
               which are born in thee, thou must distinguish and select from them all the hunger
               which cometh of thy need, but thou must from time to time restrain even this, in
               order that the endurance of thy affliction may be the more made manifest, by which
               thy love unto God is made known. Take heed then that the hunger of lust lead thee not
               astray and thou imagine it to be the hunger of nature. Now the real hunger of nature
               is not the want of food in the stomach, but the want of the power of the food in all
               the members, for when the members have put off the power of food, and have put on in
               its stead weakness, and although thou callest unto them they respond not with
               whatever service thou wishest, this is natural hunger; and thou must <pb
                  type="external" n="429"/>therefore take carefully such food as will restore the
               power to the members, being watchful of thy thought that it be not mingled with the
               body in the meat, and thou must make the lust which is in thee to sleep, lest it be
               roused up and the lust for food be excited by thee instead of by want; and if this
               happeneth thy meal is one to be blamed, even though thou takest food because of
               hunger, and eatest sparingly.</p>
            <p>Let thy thoughts then observe at all seasons all thy affairs, whether it be those
               which are in the world, or those which are in thy body, or all the others which are
               wrought in the soul. For a man is not an animal that he should feed whenever he is
               hungry, but he is bound, like a rational being, whenever the body sheweth its natural
               hunger, to make the soul shew the forbearance which becometh it, and it shall make
               use <pb n="412"/>of that which is its own, even as doth the body also of the things
               which belong to its nature, and the hunger of the body shall be a reminder of its own
               hunger, and it shall take its need as the testimony of the need of its spiritual
               life. For the soul is not bound to bring itself mightily into subjection unto the
               feminine passions of the body, but it must rouse itself up in war against them, and
               must subdue, and fetter, and be master of, and overcome them; and it must produce in
               itself arrangements and preparations against these lusts which rise up from below,
               and which abase its greatness, and defile its fair beauty. When the body at any time
               whatsoever maketh war against thee with its needs, or with the hunger of its lusts,
               thou must conquer in the war at that season by patient endurance, and by producing in
               thee as an antidote against that hunger another hunger, and thou must turn thy mind
                  <pb type="external" n="430"/>from the thought of the hunger of the body unto
               meditation upon, and converse with God, for in this way wilt thou be able to overcome
               the importunity of the passion of its hunger. For if natural hunger were to obtain
               dominion over each one of us very little, or ever so little, we should all be hungry
               together, but because hunger is also produced from the feeling of desire we become
               hungry at different seasons. For who doth not know that that hunger which cometh at
               the beginning of the day, or at the third hour, or even at the sixth hour, is not
               natural hunger? because, as I have said, natural hunger is the want of the strength
               of meat in the members of the body, and that the passion can be vanquished by the
               power of patient endurance sheweth particularly that it is not natural hunger; and,
               moreover, even if it were natural, in this case <pb n="413"/>also would it be right
               that it should be mastered, because our rule and life are superior to nature, and our
               strife is against nature. For behold the human life which is in us is not the
               feelings of nature, but they are nature, and although it be thus, because of the
               truth we fight also against human life, for the limits are marked out and laid down;
               for unto the limit of death for the sake of righteousness we must fight against these
               lusts, but the war which is for faith's sake is against natural life. And we are not
               commanded by <persName>our Redeemer</persName> to slay ourselves of our own freewill by patient
               endurance for the sake of the labours of righteousness, but for the truth's sake we
               are commanded to die; so then it is right that we should contend by rule and conduct
               on the side of <pb type="external" n="431"/>faith against all the needs of nature,
               but for the truth we must contend against the natural life.</p>
            <p>Repress then, [O disciple,] thy passion of hunger when this lust is stirred up in
               thee, and set in battle array against it all the powers of thy thoughts, that if it
               be not vanquished by one, it may be overcome by many. For how can that lust, which is
               wont to be overcome by one living motion for God's sake, avoid being vanquished by
               the might of many thoughts, if this motion be in us in a healthy manner as if it
               arose from a living and healthy nature? For as is the power of the hand, so also is
               [the force] of the stone which is cast therefrom, and according to the might of the
               arm is the power of the arrow which is shot forth by it, and as are the strength and
               healthy condition of the soul, so also is the healthy motion which is sent forth by
               it to the war against lust, and lust (even though it happen that it hath held us fast
                  <pb n="414"/>habitually for a long time past), that is to say need, is not able to
               abide before it.</p>
            <p>And observe that a distinction also existeth between one kind of need and another,
               for there is the need which ariseth from lust, and that which ariseth from a healthy
               state, and that which ariseth from strength, and that which ariseth from life; let us
               then forsake the former kinds of need, and make use of the last, so that when we are
               constrained to satisfy a want, it may not be that which ariseth from lust, or health,
               or from strength, but only that which ariseth <pb type="external" n="432"/>from life
               itself, even as we learn also from the testimony of the righteous men of old, who did
               not satisfy the want of any one of these three, and of whom some persisted and
               endured patiently a fast for forty days, and some for three weeks. And it is not
               known that they satisfied [their] needs for the sake of [their] life only, and the
               limit of <persName>our Redeemer</persName>'s fast sheweth this to us, and His answer to <persName>the
               Calumniator</persName> also teacheth us this openly, for it is written, <quote>Man shall not live by
               bread alone, but by every word which goeth forth from the mouth of God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n414-1"/> Now
               He said <quote>shall live,</quote> and not, <quote>shall be sound,</quote> nor, <quote>shall be strong,</quote> nor, <quote>shall
               be filled its lust's need;</quote> and although this word is of little importance in its
               utterance, yet a great distinction is apparent therein. For He taught us clearly by
               that word that not by bread alone should man live, but that he should eat only to
               live, and not for the sake of lust, or strength, or healthy condition; for according
               to these things is life stablished also in sickness, and in weakness a man liveth
               unto them in <pb n="415"/>the world. And as whosoever hath a severe disease in his
               body, that is to say, in those members which are the receptacles of meat, the food
               which he receiveth nourisheth his disease and not his strength, even so also
               whosoever feedeth the lust which is in him, his meat nourisheth his lust and not his
               human life; and it is manifest that whosoever nourisheth his lust <pb type="external"
                  n="433"/>giveth birth to [other] lusts, for as is the nature of the ground, so is
               also the taste of the [fruit of] trees which grow up therefrom.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt not then, [O disciple,] devour like a slave, but eat like a free man, and
               let not thy food be unto others but unto thyself, for instead of ministering unto the
               bondage of lust thou must be a minister unto thyself. And who is there that
               understanding all this will diminish [the food of] his own mouth and put [it] into
               the mouth of others, even though it be that of a helpful friend? how much less then
               [into that] of an enemy, that is, the contrary of thy true life? For there is no
               power in lust to lead thy life into subjection, but it taketh might from thine own
               might to subjugate thee; thou shalt not, then, take thy power and give it unto lust
               that it may fight against thee therewith, and thou shalt not clothe thine enemy in
               armour that thou mayest contend against him therein. Thou shalt not be in doubt
               concerning thyself, that is to say, thou shalt not be wholly on the side of thine
               enemy and turn and wage war against thyself, for this lust, if thou wilt, is a feeble
               thing, and how can it help being a feeble thing if without thee it cannot even exist?
               If now thou dost create it, thou must also give it strength; and if it beginneth to
               exist from thee, from thee must it obtain strength to gain power over thee; for as
               God <pb n="416"/>is over created things so art thou god over thy lusts, and as by the
               will of the Creator created things exist, and if He willeth not they exist not, so
               also according to thy will are thy lusts, and at thy will they become nothing. <quote>God
               calleth <pb type="external" n="434"/>the things which are not as if they
               were,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n416-1"/> even so also doth thy will create the lusts which are not, that they
               may come into existence; now God looketh upon all things, and they become nothing, so
               also doth thy will [look] upon all the passions, and straightway they are destroyed
               and become nothing. If thou wishest, they are thy passions; and if thou wishest, they
               do not exist. From thee springeth up the cause of thy lust, and from thee is born the
               destruction thereof; if thou makest it to live, thou canst make it to die, and if
               thou makest lust to live in thee, thou makest thy life which is in God to die. A man
               cannot by any means live with God and with lust at the same time, even as he cannot
               live with <persName>the Calumniator</persName> and with <persName>Christ</persName> also; for the lust of the body is a
               goad unto the man of the spirit, in the same manner that <persName>the Calumniator</persName> is the
               contrary of thy whole self. All the fair passions spring up from the soul in thee by
               the help of Grace, but the origin of abominable lusts is from the body, and the Enemy
               doth urge them on; therefore vanquish that which it is meet should be overcome, that
               He to Whom the victory belongeth may overcome by thee, and fight and conquer the
               first lust, that thereby and henceforth the conquest of them all may be easy. For if
               one lust can overcome thee, how very much more easily can many overcome thee! And
               moreover, when all lusts are gathered together [against thee], <pb n="417"/>yet are
               they powerless, and how very much more easily are they made impotent when thou dost
               vanquish them one by one by the persistence of patient endurance!</p>
            <p>And, moreover, it is right for thee to make a distinction between them, in order that
               victory over them may be easy for thee. <pb type="external" n="435"/>For when the
               lusts desire to make an attack upon thy patient endurance in a body, thou shalt not
               give unto them that which they seek, but thou shalt engage in war with them all, only
               thou must cut off and separate them one from another, and fight against each one of
               them singly, and gain the victory; and thou shalt not allow them to perfect their
               will in thee, not only by not allowing them to overcome thee, but also by preventing
               their coming [upon thee] in a body. Now by their coming in a body in this manner,
               their weakness is displayed, and if, when gathered together, their infirmity is
               revealed unto thee, how very much more will their utter powerlessness be apparent
               when each one of them cometh against thee singly? Watch then diligently that portion
               of the desire for truth which is in thee, and which longeth for life, and panteth for
               that which is good, and which lusteth with a healthy, and not with a destructive
               lust. For the lust of destruction is laid beneath destruction, and it speedily
               destroyeth whomsoever wisheth to possess the power of patient endurance; but the lust
               which destroyeth not, even when its enemies think that they have overcome it, is not
               loosed from the sure fixity of its nature, and although it be thought that it is
               conquered, it is by no means overcome, but it removeth itself from the thought which
               is unworthy of it, even when it is held thereby, and it fighteth against abominable
               lust.</p>
            <p>Now therefore it is good that we should overcome all <pb n="418"/>lusts, but
               especially <pb type="external" n="436"/>the first lust by which, if we overcome it,
               we receive the strength of victory against other lusts; for when this evil lust shall
               be vanquished in us, together therewith shall be conquered the others which follow in
               its train. And as we see that our work hath multiplied, in that we have in
               vanquishing one overcome many, so let us devote ourselves more diligently to the
               work, because if we are dilatory, not only shall we incur defeat in this, but in all
               other contests which will enter in thereafter. And as, if we conquer in the first
               victory, it is the victory in all other contests, so also if we be defeated, it is
               the defeat in all other battles; therefore it is right that we should be victors at
               all times, because it is the victory of our nature, and because it is outside our
               nature to be overcome, both because of our own will and because of the blandishments
               of our enemies. Let us then voluntarily fulfil the will of God our Creator, Who hath
               set us in the strife that we may be victors, and let not that king Who chose us be
               ashamed of us, and be reproached because He hath chosen and mingled sluggish soldiers
               in His camp; for our defeat would show the ignorance of Him Who chose us, and
               therefore let us be victors, that the Wise Being may not be thought to be foolish
               through us.</p>
            <p>Observe then by the experience of thy contest with what thoughts this lust of the
               belly, when it troubleth thee, may be overcome, and by this habit, whenever it
               setteth itself in battle array against thee, do thou array in order of battle these
               thoughts against it, and after the victory thou wilt receive the sweets of conquest.
               For so long as thou art disturbed by the prickings <pb type="external" n="437"/>of
               lust, thou wilt never taste the pleasure of victory: <pb n="419"/>but after a little,
               when thou art clothed with the armour of patient endurance, thou shalt go forth from
               the strife of the battle with victory, and the pleasure of victory shall meet thee.
               And it is impossible that pleasure should light upon thee in the world, for pleasure
               is born of labour, and it is impossible for the harvest to be produced in thy grasp
               whilst thou holdest the seed in thy hand, for crops are gathered from the seed after
               it hath been sown. And, moreover, whilst thou art still standing in the thick of the
               battle, and it is not apparent to which side victory will incline, it is impossible
               for thy triumph to be proclaimed in the cities; but after the war is ended, and
               victory hath appeared, then shall the triumph of the warrior be proclaimed in the
               cities. According to these examples, then, take thou this spiritual war in which thou
               art engaged. And if thou art disturbed when thou fightest, know that this befitteth
               thee, and if thy fighting be laboured and thou sweatest, this also cleaveth unto thy
               work; for if there be a battle, there must be labour therein, and if there be a
               contest, in weariness and sweat must run those who enter in to it.</p>
            <p>Do thou, then, not consider the things which are near, but look beforehand at the
               pleasures which [come] after the tribulations, and let not thy mind be fettered unto
               thy body, but let it hasten to see the things which are about to come, that thou
               mayest strengthen with the remembrance of victory the members which stand in battle.
               Thou art a spiritual being and must wage war against the lust of the body, and the
               spiritual being who is overcome by the body is a laughingstock; and it is a disgrace
                  <pb type="external" n="438"/>unto him that is invited to heaven, that the belly
               should contend with him and <pb n="420"/>overcome him. For if thou art ordained by
               Grace to fight and conquer spiritual principalities and powers, that is to say, the
               hosts and the companies which are opposed to thee, how very much more is it meet for
               thee to vanquish the belly? And behold thy garb hath been dedicated unto this, and
               the appearance of thy rule of life proclaimeth for thee victory over the hosts which
               are opposed [to thee]. And who would not laugh at the man who hath prepared himself
               for these things if he should see his belly overcoming him? especially when it is not
               the necessary of life which urgeth thee to this, but the lust which is born of the
               feebleness of thy will, and that that which is born of thee, not being a man of might
               but as yet a child and youth, which it would have been easy for thee to have set
               under thy heel, hath stood up in battle against thee, and hath laid thee low.</p>
            <p>And see then also how the Spirit counselleth thee, saying, <quote>Dash the children of
               <placeName>Babylon</placeName> upon the stones while they are young.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n420-1"/> And well hath the word of
               prophecy called these passions <quote>children,</quote> that it might show thee their
               powerlessness, and might encourage thee to victory; and it did not say <quote>thy
               children,</quote> that it might not cause thee disgrace, as if such children appeared from
               thee, but it named them <quote>children of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>,</quote> that is to say, children who were
               born of slavery and not of freedom, because the mother which giveth birth to lusts is
               the slavery which the word of prophecy hath symbolized by <placeName>Babylon</placeName> which hath been
               wasted, and which carrieth off rapaciously like spoil the <pb type="external" n="439"
               />power of the spiritual man, and plundereth his riches.</p>
            <p>Now therefore when lust hath joined itself unto hunger <pb n="421"/>to wage war
               against thee, do thou unite thy thought unto Grace, and stand up in prayer, and as if
               thou didst despise lust, do not even turn thy thoughts thereunto—now I mean that lust
               which is great—for even when thou fightest and dost overcome, thy victory will still
               be subject unto defects, for thou hast had need of fighting, and then thou didst
               conquer the belly—for it is right that thou shouldst despise it, and that it should
               be of no account in thy sight, and that thy thought should not cleave thereunto—but
               thou must despise it as a mighty man despiseth a feeble one, and as a man of strength
               and power despiseth one that is contemptible and wretched. And it is also the custom
               of brave warriors when they see feeble men coming against them to fight to despise
               them, and to have them in contempt, and to laugh at their advance, even as it is
               written concerning that blasphemous giant whose boast lay in the strength of his
               body, who, <quote>when he saw <persName>David</persName> despised him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n421-1"/> And if all the contempt which
               he had in him for <persName>David</persName> arose from his confidence in his flesh, why shouldst not
               thou, by the power of the spirit which is in thee, despise and hold in contempt the
               lust of the belly? For whom doth it usually conquer except infants and young
               children? For immediately the lust of the belly afflicteth them with its need they
               begin to cry and to importune their parents, and to ask them for what they want, and
               they do this because they have not yet attained unto the age in which the power of
               patient endurance is born of <pb type="external" n="440"/>the soul. But thou hast
               attained, like a giant, unto this age, and the power of thy soul hath been revealed
               unto thee, if thou desirest to make use <pb n="422"/>thereof; and why shouldst thou
               be vanquished by the belly like a child, and become a thing to mock at, that the
               passion of childhood may make a laughingstock of thee? For in the age in which being
               overcome by the belly is akin unto the nature of the stature of a child, in that same
               age [I say], victory over it is to thee also akin, and as his childhood is subject
               unto defeat, even so doth victory cleave unto thine own full-grown stature.</p>
            <p>Understand then from this also the feebleness of the lust of the belly, for its
               fighting belongeth unto the condition of children, for we see that all the other
               lusts renew themselves against our life in the various states of [our] growth which
               follow after [childhood], but this lust of the belly is stirred up in childhood; and
               thou must know that it is because it is feeble that it fighteth against the child,
               but when it wageth war against thee it cometh only [to make] a trial, and not [to
               obtain] the victory. Overcome then with thy persistence that, the defeat of which,
               even when thou hast conquered it, is not a great thing, because it is a war of
               childhood, but the benefit which is produced therefrom is not a feeble thing—for
               being small and contemptible, when thou hast overcome it, its defeat is not a thing
               to wonder at; but it openeth unto us the door of triumphs over all the passions, and
               when the other lusts which follow in its train see this, they become so enfeebled
               that they cannot come to fight, <pb type="external" n="441"/>or if they draw nigh to
               fight, they do so with fear and terror, and because of this they fight with half
               their strength and not with [their] full force, for fear is wont to diminish and to
               dissipate their power.</p>
            <p>Fight then, O disciple, and overcome like a man, <pb n="423"/>that thou mayest be
               crowned gloriously like a warrior. Thou shalt not be conquered, for thou wast not set
               apart for this; thou shalt not fall because thou wert not chosen for this; thou shalt
               not surrender, because the mighty Hand is with thee; for the Hand of <persName>Christ</persName> will be
               with thee in the wars which thou shalt wage against all these things, if only thou
               wilt perceive the right Hand which graspeth thy right hand, and the mighty Arm which
               holdeth thy feeble hand.</p>
            <p>And now, since it is fitting that I should teach thee the first kinds of this victory
               listen, and I will tell thee. Do not, then, attribute unto thyself victory when thou
               conquerest the lust for rare and costly meats only, but when thou conquerest [thy
               lust] for poor and common food, thou mayest consider this a genuine victory; for the
               disciple is bound to excuse himself not only from the eating of flesh and the
               drinking of wine, but also from everything for which he lusteth; do not then fight
               against meat, but against lust. If it be that thou makest war against the kind of
               meat, when thou hast vanquished in the war against one kind, another will fight
               against thee, but if thou overcomest lust in only one thing out of many, with this
               thou wilt also overcome another, for there are certain meats of which if a solitary
               or a <pb type="external" n="442"/>coenobite make use, the reproach on their account
               is evident; now in this war shame of the multitude will help thee, and many times
               wilt thou be prevented from eating by reason of the shame before those who behold
               thee; and since it happeneth that thou hast help in this war from outside, the
               conquest therein is small. But do thou, like one wise unto advantages, and cunning
               unto benefits, fight against those things which are permitted to be eaten, and
               against the lust thereof <pb n="424"/>do thou wage war; and briefly, I will give thee
               an indication [of what they are]. Everything which is laid upon the table for thy
               food, and which thine eye looketh upon and lusteth after, thou shalt not think of,
               but say quietly unto thy belly, <quote>Because thou hast lusted therefor thou shalt not
               taste it;</quote> and when it hath received from thee this law, it will occupy itself with
               its need, and the eye of its lust will not be extended and diffused over the meats.
               And I also say that which, because it will be thought new, not every man will
               forthwith accept, but the few and the small in number will understand it, and these
               will suffice: it is better for thee to eat flesh without lust, than lentiles with it,
               for by the eating of the flesh passion will not be produced, but in respect of that
               which is inferior (i. e., the lentiles) lust goeth before the eating thereof, and an
               accusation is brought against the food because of a man's lust therefor, and not
               because of its nature. Hast thou forgotten that which <persName>Paul</persName> crieth, saying,
               <quote>Everything which hath been created by God is holy, and nothing is to be rejected if
               it be received with thanksgiving?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n424-1"/> But <pb type="external" n="443"/>take
               good heed unto me, in this case also, that thou receive not this word as free
               permission to eat flesh, and that thou make not use thereof, for the sake of
               ministering unto thy lusts, for unto the free it is written. If thou hast been
               tempted in thy soul which standeth upon the height of the freedom of <persName>Christ</persName>, and
               hast subdued by the power of thy patient endurance the bondage which is in thee, thou
               mayest make use of these words, if when thou eatest thou dost not eat with thy
               senses, and when thou drinkest thou dost not <pb n="425"/>drink longingly that which
               thou drinkest. If thou canst eat like a dead man, eat, but if thou eatest like a
               living man, take heed that thou dost not taste thy food with pleasure; for the
               perception of the taste of that which thou eatest testifieth against thee that thou
               art still alive unto lust, and that thou eatest in order that thou mayest eat, and
               not that thou mayest live. And <persName>Saint Paul</persName>, standing upon the height of this
               freedom, said, <quote>Let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n425-1"/> neither
               let him that eateth because of his freedom despise him that eateth not because of the
               bondage of the law, because he whom the law leadeth is yet a servant, and hath not
               yet arrived at the perfect freedom of <persName>Christ</persName>. See then therefore, and think not
               that thou standest in the freedom of <persName>Christ</persName> whilst thou still servest in bondage,
               and dost eat everything without being permitted so to do. For <persName>the blessed Apostle</persName>
               also warns thee against lusting with thoughts of freedom, whilst thou art still a
               slave, saying, <quote>Ye have been called unto freedom, my brethren;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n425-2"/> but let not
               your freedom be for the eating of flesh, and if thou art still a slave, let not only
                  <pb type="external" n="444"/>the laws which are external direct thee, but also the
               laws of thy discretion. For the external laws are kept for many reasons, for
               appearance, for fear, for praise, for the love of honour, for imagination, for the
               growth of other passions, that a man may humble his enemies, and that he may shew
               unto others who are slack the comparison of his wickedness, and similarly there are
               many other reasons [for the keeping] of the external law; but let the law of thy
               discretion be unto thee, so that if thou lustest after anything thou must restrain
               thyself from making use thereof. And moreover, in respect of <pb n="426"/>that for
               which thou lustest, thou must know that as yet thou art a slave, and when thou hast
               in this manner perceived thy slavery, thou must know that the law requireth thee to
               conquer henceforth, and to encircle with the law all the motions of thy thoughts, and
               every thought which moveth in thee with the lust for something restrain by the fear
               of the law, examining very carefully both the motions of nature and the motions of
               lust, and if the motion be of nature, suppress it, but if it be of lust, root it up.
               Now thou hast power to uproot the motions of lust, but the motions of nature thou
               canst only suppress and quiet, because lust itself receiveth its motion from nature,
               for it inclineth and looketh unto nature to be moved; and when it seeth that it is
               moved, it taketh the motion and maketh it its own, and it bringeth it out, and giveth
               it unto thy will to perform in very deed. Thou must then, like one who seeth thy
               passions, understand when any feeling of lust is mingled in the <pb type="external"
                  n="445"/>motion, I mean the motion which receiveth [something] from nature,
               because it receiveth what it needeth, and returneth; now I distinguish between that
               motion and the motion of lust, that I may not eat and be overcome.</p>
            <p>Overcome therefore the lust for garden herbs, that thou mayest thereby overcome the
               lust of fornication, and let not common food stir thee up, in order that what hath a
               fair guise may not excite thee. Despise thou poor and contemptible things, lest they
               gather together against thee the lusts of those which are mighty, for lust doth not
               wage war against thee but against that which is akin unto thy rule of life. Because
               thou art remote from the meats of the world, and from preparations of cooked foods,
               and from the eating of flesh, and the drinking <pb n="427"/>of strained wines, lust
               is slow in bringing these things nigh unto thee, for it knoweth that they are remote
               from thee, and that they have no connexion with thy promises that thou shouldst make
               use of them, and that they are cut off from thee by custom, and by law, and by thy
               dwelling, and by thy rule of life. And where lust seeth that there is something which
               will fight on its account it ceaseth from making war against such things, and
               pricketh thee with others, that is with ordinary meats, with the lust of dried
               vegetables, with the lust of garden herbs, and with the lust for cold water instead
               of strained wine, which things will be thought by thee not [worthy] of great blame,
               for their commonness is an excuse for them, and it adviseth thee, saying, <quote>Eat, and
               thou shalt not be blamed, and drink and thou shalt not be reproached, for these are
               necessaries, and it is not meet that thou shouldst restrain thyself therefrom,
               especially <pb type="external" n="446"/>at eventide, or thou mayest draw nigh to
               taste them once in two days. Eat everything which is set before thee, and eat until
               thou art satisfied, in order that thy body may be strengthened, and [be able] to bear
               labours;</quote> for slackness in the guise of righteousness giveth thee counsel, because it
               seeth how many times thou hatest the advice of slackness which is evident. But do not
               thou be flattered by the person of these things, and despise not the commonness of
               things, and do not imagine that food is naturally reprehensible, for it is only so
               when a man shall eat it with lust; whether a man eat flesh or herbs with lust the
               eating of both is the same thing, and they are reprehensible because lust hath eaten
               them. It was not the fruit which <persName>Eve</persName> ate that brought forth death, but it was the
               lust thereof which brought forth <pb n="428"/>death; for if she had kept the law, and
               had not eaten with lust at that time, how many times could she have eaten of it
               afterwards, and not been blamed, provided that she took it unto herself in the
               ordinary way like [that of] other trees? And she drew nigh unto it, for it is written
               that she lusted, and then ate,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n428-1"/> and for this reason she was condemned. And
               what then was the nature of this fruit which was able to produce death, together with
               all [other] wickedness? Now, behold, according to what many say, and according also
               to the slight indication which the Book itself giveth unto us, the fruit which <persName>Eve</persName>
               ate was of the fig-tree, and it is manifest that the nature of the fig-tree is not to
               produce death; therefore it was lust which gave birth unto death, which it hath in
               all generations produced for man. For the root of death is <pb type="external"
                  n="447"/>lust, and the root of lust is carnal union, and for this reason all those
               who are born of carnal union are moved by lust, and are subject unto death, except
               One who was not born of carnal union; for this reason He was free from the motion of
               lust, and therefore He appeared superior to natural death, which, although He took it
               upon Himself, was voluntary and not natural. So then the nature of food is not
               reprehensible, although it is blameworthy when lust eateth it. And the reason for
               setting apart and prohibiting to the Jews the meats which are severally mentioned in
               the law was to teach them to overcome their lust for certain things, for if the law
               had prohibited every kind of meat the command would have been heavy upon them, and
               they would not have received it, and because the commandment <pb n="429"/>did not
               prevent them from [eating] even one [of them], they were moved within themselves,
               like animals without discretion, unto all lusts; and as they had not wherewith to
               learn that it was good for a rational being to overcome his lust, He allowed them to
               eat by reason of [their] weakness, and He prohibited them from eating many of them
               that the distinction of their rational nature might appear, and that they might learn
               to contend against lusts; and because they would not undertake with good will the war
               against lusts, He made meats unclean to them, that because they were unclean they
               might be restrained from making use of them. Now with thee He hath not done thus, but
                  <pb type="external" n="448"/>He hath purified and sanctified everything, as it is
               written, <quote>Everything is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n429-1"/> that
               henceforth the patient endurance of thy discretion might appear, and that thou
               mightest not eat, not because they were impure, but because it hath been said that it
               is good that thou shouldst not eat flesh nor drink wine, nor anything by which our
               brother may stumble,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n429-2"/> and also that thou mightest overcome lust by thine own
               will, and not by the restriction of the uncleanness of meats.</p>
            <p>Now against the things which are unclean naturally lust doth not rise up, and
               therefore everything is holy before thee; therefore when on all sides the materials
               which provoke thy lust shall appear, thou shalt suppress and overcome them by the
               love of God, and moreover, because of this, it is seemly for thee to appear
               temperate. Unto thee, then, let the meats which are set apart, that is to say,
               everything for which thou lustest, <pb n="430"/>be unclean unto thee, for that which
               thou bringest nigh unto thyself for its need's sake without lust thou art allowed to
               eat without reprehension, the law which restraineth thee permitting [thee so to do];
               the law is not written outside thee, as in the case of some, but it is that which is
               written upon thy heart, and thy conscience testifieth concerning it, and only by
               thyself is it read, and others who are outside thee see it not, and thy freedom, as
               by the law, is not prohibited from eating, that it may not transgress the law if it
               eateth.</p>
            <p>For freedom is above the law, <pb type="external" n="449"/>and therefore it is the
               same to thee whether thou eatest, or whether thou eatest not, even as <persName>Paul</persName> spake
               concerning this freedom of the spirit, saying, <quote>He that regardeth the day, regardeth
               it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth it not, regardeth it not unto the Lord; and
               he that eateth not eateth not unto God; and he that eateth, eateth unto God, and
               giveth thanks unto the Lord;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n430-1"/> so then it belongeth unto us by this freedom
               to eat, or not to eat. And for this reason He did not make a difference between meats
               severally mentioned by the law, that they might not be distinguished before us by
               lust or by the absence of lust, and that we should not excuse ourselves from eating
               that for which we lust as if through uncleanness, whether it be rare or whether it be
               common, or whether it be permitted to be eaten according to custom or not; so then
               that from the eating of which lust ariseth not in us we may eat as of that which is
               clean, without our conscience pricking us during the eating thereof. </p>
            <p>The prick of the conscience is the transgression of the <pb n="431"/>law, as hath
               been said also by <persName>the Apostle</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n431-1"/> for if a man be in doubt, and he eateth, he
               is condemned. The Jews ate flesh in the wilderness, and it is written concerning them
               that, <quote>While the flesh was yet between their teeth the anger of God had dominion
               over them,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n431-2"/> not because they had eaten flesh, but because with lust they had
               asked to eat it, for if the eating of flesh commonly brought anger whenever they ate
               it, they would have received this penalty, and, moreover, the priests who continually
               ate <pb type="external" n="450"/>flesh in the temple would have deserved also the
               very same condemnation; but it is not written anywhere that anger had dominion over
               them because of the eating of flesh except in this place. That they sought flesh
               lustfully, and asked for it with lust, <persName>David</persName> testifieth, saying, <quote>They lusted with
               lust in the wilderness, and they tempted God in the waterless desert. And He gave
               them their requests, and sent fulness into their souls.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n431-3"/> And in the place
               where they required flesh it is written that, <quote>The people said to <persName>Moses</persName>, It was
               better for us when we were in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, for we sat by the flesh pots, and did eat, and
               were filled [with] everything that our soul lusted for.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n431-4"/> And again when
               <persName>Moses</persName> saw that they lusted, and were made unclean by their lust, he said to them,
               <quote>Sanctify yourselves [against] tomorrow that ye may eat flesh,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n431-5"/> as if a man
               were to say, Because your persons have been made unclean by your lusts, and the gift
               of God draweth not nigh unto the unclean, sanctify yourselves from the lust that ye
               may be worthy to eat <pb n="432"/>the gift of flesh, for <quote>Ye shall not eat it one
               day, nor ten days, nor twenty days, but a whole month, until it come out from your
               nostrils, and it become indigestion unto you; because that ye have rejected the Lord
               Who is among you, and have said, Who will give us flesh to eat?</quote></p>
            <p>Behold then, according to the word of <persName>Moses</persName> unto the Jews, every one that eateth in
               lust, <pb type="external" n="451"/>rejecteth the Lord Who is in him, and he resteth
               upon his lust's desire. Well then was indigestion made the limit of the meat which
               lust required, for need observeth a limit, but lust hath neither limit nor end.
               Understand then [the matter] from another side also. It was because they lusted that
               they were condemned and not because they ate flesh, for behold <persName>Elijah</persName> did not ask
               for [food] with lust, but the ravens fed him with bread and flesh, evening and
               morning, and he drank water from the brook;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n432-1"/> and when flesh was sent unto the
               prophet by the Giver, he by the power of his freedom received it like a meal of
               garden herbs. And thou must in another way understand that it is lust which is
               reprehensible, for every day, morning after morning, the people gathered the manna
               which came down, and so long as they gathered it according to the command they were
               not reprehended or condemned; but when they lusted to gather it in too great a
               quantity, it swarmed with worms and stank,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n432-2"/> to the shame of the lust which
               gathered it. And moreover when they ate it formerly, its taste was changed into that
               of all [kinds of] meats in their mouth, and it is well known that it also took the
               place of flesh unto <pb n="433"/>them, for it is written, <quote>It was like honey comb,
               and its taste was as if it had been kneaded in oil.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n433-1"/> And although it was
               changed into all these varieties of food the eaters thereof were not condemned
               thereby, for <pb type="external" n="452"/>it was a gift of Grace, and not that which
               their lust had demanded.</p>
            <p>Now that thou mayest understand that it is everything that is eaten with lust, even
               though it be common, that is reprehensible, set before thine eyes these two examples,
               the eating of <persName>Esau</persName>, and the eating of <persName>Elijah</persName>. <persName>Esau</persName>, because he ate lentiles,
               was condemned, and therefore <persName>Paul</persName> calleth him <quote>dissolute,</quote> and <quote>fornicator,</quote>
               because <quote>for one mess of meat he sold his own birthright;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n433-2"/> and <persName>Elijah</persName>,
               though eating meat, was pure and holy, and a spiritual being, and like a spiritual
               being was removed unto the place of spiritual beings. Behold then, and understand
               from the two examples of <persName>Elijah</persName> and <persName>Esau</persName>, that it is lust which causeth
               condemnation and not meat. Seek then to eat everything and not to be condemned, and
               be above lust in everything, and eat everything; but if thou canst not be superior to
               lust, everything that thou eatest will be a condemnation unto thee, even though it be
               a common thing, as <persName>Eve</persName> was condemned for eating the fruit, and as the Jews were
               censured for gathering the manna, and as <persName>Esau</persName> was condemned for eating the
               lentiles, and as the people also who perished, because they ate and drank with lust
               before the calf.</p>
            <p>And that even the drinking of cold water with lust is reprehensible <persName>David</persName>, the wise
               man of God, shall prove unto thee, for when he lusted to drink water <pb n="434"
               />from the great cistern which was in <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>, and those who did hear [him]
               obeyed and brought [it] to him,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n434-1"/> he suppressed his lust, and poured it out
               before the Lord, as if <pb type="external" n="453"/>by means, thereof he was pouring
               out [his] lust; now the nature of water is not such as to cause sin even if he had
               partaken thereof, for it is cool and pleasant, but he perceived within himself that
               he had asked for it with lust and he conquered his lust, and did not grant its
               request. And he did this also that he might vex those who had been ministers unto his
               lust, by turning back their kindness upon themselves, that he might teach every man
               not to be in subjection unto his lust, and that we should not make our faces joyful
               towards those who minister unto our lust. And God permitted <persName>Noah</persName> also to eat every
               thing like green herbs, and though <persName>Adam</persName> was censured because he had eaten the
               fruit, yet to <persName>Noah</persName> power was given, as by a covenant of gift, over all meats—now
               where it was partaken of with lust, there was it reprehended, for having received
               through the taste of lust the pleasure of wine, he drank thereof inordinately and
               immoderately, and was in this case laid under sin—for God permitted him to eat every
               kind of flesh after which his soul lusted. Now although this meat is a burden unto
               the wise and prudent, yet was it given by promise unto <persName>Noah</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n434-2"/> and it was
               sent unto <persName>Elijah</persName> in a gift,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n434-3"/> and <persName>Abraham</persName> received God and His angels
               thereby,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n434-4"/> and <persName>Isaac</persName> was pleased to pour out blessings upon <persName>Jacob</persName>
               thereby,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n434-5"/> and <persName>Samuel</persName> offered this gift beforehand to <persName>Saul</persName> as to a
               king,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n434-6"/> and <persName>David</persName> and all the righteous <pb n="435"/>kings made use of such
               meat, and it was employed by all the righteous; <pb type="external" n="454"/>and they
               were not blamed therefor, because they were superior to lust. And they did not eat
               like slaves with lust, but they made use of every thing with authority like free men,
               and they in their eating of rare meats were praised, while those who fed themselves
               upon ordinary and common foods were rejected and reprobated. Now <persName>Paul</persName> crieth unto
               us, <quote>Let not your hearts be made heavy through the eating of flesh and the drinking
               of wine,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n435-1"/> that he may teach us that meat maketh heavy the heart, but they
               ate and did not become heavy, and they ate, moreover, that they might show that their
               lightness was more powerful than the heaviness of meat, and that by that thing which
               maketh dense the heart their mind became the brighter, and that by that which maketh
               heavy the body, and darkeneth the mind, the lightness of their understanding became
               more luminous. For being abstinent, that they should be clean, and pure, and holy,
               was not accounted by them so great a thing as that they should be purified in the
               matter of the things which make gross the heart, that is to say, that they should be
               purified in the matter of the things which are the contrary of purity, that they
               might overcome like mighty men that which was opposed to them, and that, like men of
               power and freemen, they might be uninjured by the things which cause injury.</p>
            <p>But thou hast not arrived at this point, and to this grade thou hast not yet
               ascended, therefore it is necessary for thee to abstain from every thing, and to eat
               in moderation that thou mayest be pure, and <pb n="436"/>to eat and to drink by
               weight and measure that thou mayest be clean, because according to thy promise thou
               must run after purity <pb type="external" n="455"/>of soul, and thou must seek
               diligently to arrive at the likeness of the angels. But thou wilt not be able to
               stand in the freedom of spiritual beings until thou hast cast away entirely the
               bondage of carnal beings, for when thou hast cast away this bondage like a spiritual
               being and freeman thou mayest eat of every thing blamelessly, without making thy
               heart gross by the eating of flesh, and the drinking of wine will not cloud thy
               thoughts, even as it is written concerning the angels, that <quote>They ate flesh and drank
               wine with <persName>Abraham</persName>;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n436-1"/> and their spiritualness was not weighed down by this
               food; moreover, like unto them also are all the righteous whose [names] are written
               in the Scriptures, who ate, and [whose hearts] neither became heavy nor gross,
               because they did not eat with a longing desire. Be thou without desire, and eat as
               did the angels with <persName>Abraham</persName>, and like all the righteous men who [are mentioned] in
               the Old Testament, and thou shall not be blamed, that is to say, thou must hold
               thyself bound to preserve the chastity of thy rule of life because this befitteth thy
               promise, and because of the benefit [which it will be] unto others, for freedom and
               power to draw nigh unto everything are not permitted unto us, and although freedom
               hath power over every thing, yet it may not be exercised in everything lest it
               destroy its own freedom. That a free man is not fettered by a lust for anything he
               sheweth by his freedom, and in that he hath the power and doth not make use thereof,
               he doubleth readily the freedom thereof, and he preserveth it from being dissipated.
                  <pb n="437"/>even as <persName>Paul</persName> writeth concerning <pb type="external" n="456"/>this
               freedom, saying, <quote>I have power [to do] everything, but not everything
               edifieth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n437-1"/> And that thou mayest learn that [it is thus] with all other
               things, and especially in the matter of eating and not eating, he maketh known the
               power of his freedom and saith immediately after these words, <quote>Meats of the belly,
               and the belly of meats, but God will bring both of them to nought.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n437-2"/></p>
            <p>Preserve then, O disciple, the habit of abstinence, that thou mayest also arrive at
               the power of freedom, and wean thyself, and eat not, that thou mayest draw nigh unto
               the state of eating without perceiving [it]; abstain from food by the power of thy
               soul, in order that the lusts which are mingled in thy members may be destroyed. Thou
               shalt not eat, that thou mayest sin not; thou shalt not drink, that thou mayest not
               err; be constant in fasting, through which thou mayest become worthy of the purity of
               prayer; diminish thy food at the time of thy eating, that the wing of thy
               understanding may be light to soar unto God; reckon with thy body even unto the most
               minute things, that thy soul may gain the mastery over the abundant riches of Divine
               knowledge thereby, and that He, who hath revealed unto thee the treasures of His
               wisdom and of His knowledge, may not make a reckoning with thee; wink thine eyes but
               little at lusts, and behold thou shalt pass over a difficult place, for the time
               wherein thou canst make use of them is little and short, but the time of immunity
               from them is without end. Be not then conquered in the time of victory, and grasp the
               battle against lust like a discovery, in order that <pb n="438"/>work may be found
               for thy soul; for so long as lusts perfect their work <pb type="external" n="457"/>in
               thee, thy soul hath no work in thee, and being in thee, it is as though it were not
               in thee, because it is empty of, and lacketh the works of its nature. When the body
               hath begun to make its lusts move in thee, leap up, and tarry [not], and abhor the
               sight of thy lust like a thing of destruction which has found work for itself. And
               thou shalt say unto thy soul, <quote>Why art thou troubled, O my soul, and why art thou sad
               because thou art deprived of gain? Behold, work hath fallen into thy hands, do it
               prosperously. Behold, lust is sent that it may shew itself against thee for the
               fight, shew forth then the skill of thy athletic art and the might of thy arms.
               Behold the material for gain, for thou lovest gain! Behold, thine enemies have
               gathered themselves together in the field of war, cry out against them with thy
               mighty voice, and rebuke and scatter the hosts of lusts which prosper not in this
               country, [for] they traffic in losses. Do thou then zealously collect [thy] gains,
               for thy victory will be the more proclaimed, if where others are conquered thou
               obtainest the victory. To the sluggish lust is the cause of defeat, but to thee,
               being diligent, it shall be the cause of triumph, for like the warrior who is
               confident in his strength, and who relieth upon his skill, and rejoiceth at the sight
               of [his] enemies, even so also do thou rejoice in the advance of lusts, for without
               them thy triumph would be empty, and thou wouldst have no material for the fight from
               which victory is produced.</quote> Let these things, then, be said unto thy soul by thee,
               whenever it happeneth <pb type="external" n="458"/>that lusts are stirred up against
               thee, but especially against this stupid lust of the belly, which is wont to spring
               from <pb n="439"/>childhood; for it entereth in as a destroyer alone, because it
               loveth to be seen by itself, and it layeth the foundation of slackness from the
               beginning of the growth of the stature of the body, so that beginning therefrom it
               may be found a helpmeet unto all lusts which spring up in every age of life.</p>
            <p>Now this is the first lust which conquered the world, and because of it the first
               transgression of the law took place; and next <persName>Cain</persName> also, in turning unto this,
               meditated the killing of his brother that he might inherit the earth by
               himself.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n439-1"/> It laid a blemish upon the righteous man <persName>Noah</persName>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n439-2"/> it

               also came to fornication,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n439-5"/> so that they were rejected from the household of

               the scribes and Pharisees received <quote>Woe</quote> from <persName>our Redeemer</persName>, because it had taught

               demanded tribute from the priests, who, without right, were taking it away from those
               who made offerings;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n440-3"/> it dismissed the sons of <persName>Eli</persName> from their
               priesthood;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n440-4"/> and by its exceeding dainties <persName>Solomon</persName> also was led into the
               error of idols.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n440-5"/> And even today it corrupteth every thing, for because of it
               the world is exhausted, and for its pleasure creation runneth its course; for its
               sake all the children of men work slavery, and it seemeth as if the door could be
               shut in the face of all wickedness if it did not exist. Consider too, and observe
               understandingly the course of every man, and the labour, and fatigue, and the sweat
               of all those who enter the world, for it is only because of it, and for its sake and
               need only, that merchants travel on the roads, and sailors go down into terrible
               seas, and ploughmen and farmers endure labour and fatigue, and workmen toil in the
               cities, and hirelings run in the market-place, and slaves serve their masters, and
               masters also sell and buy their slaves; because of it precious things are gathered
               together and treasure is laid up for years, and gold, and silver, and produce of all
               kinds are for its sake collected and heaped up. Ascend <pb type="external" n="460"
               />then, and stand upon the height of knowledge, and look upon all the world from <pb
                  n="441"/>that place, and watch the course, and the activity and the commotion, and
               the promises made by the inhabitants thereof on all sides. And observe how some
               ascend, and others descend; how some depart and others come; how one crieth out and
               another disputeth; how one contendeth, and another fighteth; how one carrieth off
               that which belongeth not to him, and another spoileth his fellow; how one stealeth
               like a thief, and how another, like a robber, plundereth on the highways; how battles
               are set in array in the marches; how kingdoms are divided against themselves; how
               captains of hosts rebel against kings, and how kings fight that their dominions be
               not taken away from them; how judges take bribes, and how advocates sell the success
               of cases iniquitously; and how for lust learners learn, and learned men teach. And
               when thou hast observed all these things and many others like unto them, and the
               various kinds of confusion and tumult which fill the world, turn thee and seek the
               cause of all these, and thou wilt find that it is the lust of the belly; and if it
               were overcome, everything would become peaceful and quiet, and thou wouldst see
               nothing in the world which would rebel against the will of God, or lead us to
               transgress the command, and to tread the law under foot, except this only.</p>
            <p>Now if any man shall say there are other causes for all the things which are
               ministered unto in the world, <pb type="external" n="461"/>let him that sayeth this
               know that the lust of the belly is also the primary cause of the other evils. And
               although passions are many and diverse, and they move themselves in various ways in
               the children of men, whereby the world is disturbed and creation troubled, yet the
               great fountain, from which these troubled streams <pb n="442"/>flow down on all
               sides, is the lust of the belly. And if a man stoppeth up this spring by the might of
               his patient endurance, he will straightway see that all the streams of wickedness,
               which are poured out therefrom, will dry up, and there will be quietness over
               everything, and peace will rule over all flesh, and there shall be abundant rest in
               troubled places, and all minds will be filled with happiness and joy, and so to say,
               if lust were not in the midst thou wouldst not see one vice in the world; for all
               wickednesses gather together thereunto, and all labours and wearying works hasten
               thereafter. That man should eat bread by the sweat of his face hath been born of
               lust, and it hath made brambles and briars to spring up, and through the ruin thereof
               the penalty of death ruleth over all; for it is the captain of the host of the left
               side, and to it are fettered all the hosts of sin, and as captains of hosts go forth
               to war at the head of their companies against the enemy, even so also doth it, as the
               captain of the host of all wickedness, go forth to war against that which is good.
               And thoughts and deeds of iniquity accompany it, and the motions and acts of sin, and
               all the deliberations of evil march at its perverse heel, <pb type="external" n="462"
               />and all the works of sin become unto it as members, and from it they receive their
               power, and they obtain their nourishment therefrom. As the senses are bound up with
               the head, even so in the lust of the belly are bound up error, and idolatry, and
               division, and suspicion, and falsehood; and as all the members of the body receive
               power and sustenance from the head, even so also are strengthened by the lust of the
               belly all wickednesses, which are:—fornication, and adultery, and other corrupt
               passions; the adornment of the person with fine apparel; the empty pleasures <pb
                  n="443"/>of the lust of the belly; and grief, and vain-glory, and pride; and wrath
               and despair, and bitterness; and wicked intent, and hatred, and enmity; and
               unrelenting anger, and burning wrath, and indignation; and violent rage, and envy,
               and bitterness; and sedition, and a deceitful face; and rule and dominion, and
               calumny, and whispering, and the tongue which continually smiteth in secret; and
               mocking, and scoffing, and fraud; and oppression, and murder, and soothsaying; and
               drunkenness, and blows; together with all other such like abominable passions, all of
               which are bound up with the lust of the belly. And I permit myself to say that of
               labours, and afflictions, and diseases, and sicknesses, and all such like things
               which afflict us in the body, lust is the cause.</p>
            <p>And whosoever fighteth by the power of forbearance, and conquereth this first evil,
               is able thereby to conquer all sin, and well <pb type="external" n="463"/>have divine
               men also handed down to us the tradition, that whosoever wisheth to be perfect in the
               way of <persName>Christ</persName> must first of all fight against this passion; therefore also if those
               who go forth from the world seeking perfection do not first of all begin by
               abstinence, they will not begin in the way of the commandments according to the law,
               and consequently they cannot finish [therein] because the lust of the belly carrieth
               them off like a thief. And although it may happen that at the beginning they make use
               thereof in a fitting manner, yet will it bring them to longings and desires of the
               thoughts, and to fantasies of the mind, and to that covering which standeth in front
               of the understanding, and darkeneth it to the sight of God, and maketh it especially
               dense, and until it be rent asunder from before <pb n="444"/>the face of the mind, a
               man will not be able to look at the Holy of Holies of the knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>, even
               though he bear afflictions and labours. For if the covering of grossness of heart be
               not rent asunder, the heavenly light cannot be seen by him, and he is not able to
               serve the rule of <persName>Christ</persName> with his soul's perception; but when this hath been rent
               asunder, a man then beginneth to perceive the renewing of his soul, and to know by
               the knowledge of his mind that he is something else besides that which can be seen
               and touched, and he receiveth also the perception of the things which are above the
               world, and wonderings and living motions concerning God, in order that he may be
               moved in a living manner like unto God Himself, and not in the manner of a dead man
               according to the nature of his body, <pb type="external" n="464"/>and briefly, after
               the victory over this lust, a man is worthy of every spiritual vision.</p>
            <p>Now if those who are in the world and who work righteousness have need of fasting and
               abstinence, how much more do those need them who have gone forth therefrom for the
               practice of a spiritual rule and conduct? For the limit of abstinence is that we
               should fight against all the meats which are made use of by the body, not with the
               forbearance of the members only, but also with the endurance of the thoughts; and if
               a man be constrained by his needs, let him eat the things which are of no account or
               value, and are common, and are both cheap and easily obtained. And let us be also
               watchful against the fulness of the belly, for as hath been said by one of the
               spiritual teachers, <quote>A fat belly cannot produce a refined mind.</quote> For the overfulness
               of the stomach without doubt darkeneth the <pb n="445"/>mind; therefore none of those
               who have had experience of knowledge can have any doubt about it, and if fools do
               doubt, they doubt because they have not experienced it, or if they do know it,
               because it is hard for them to depart from their lusts. Now therefore, what I now say
               shall shew thee a complete testimony. As the body is nourished, so the soul becometh
               enfeebled, and as the body becometh gross, and addeth body unto body by the food
               [which it taketh], the soul dwindleth and disappeareth, and although the soul
               existeth, it might be thought that it existed not in the body; and as the body addeth
               unto the strength and vigour of its stature, the stature of the soul boweth down, <pb
                  type="external" n="465"/>and its members—which are the thoughts—pine away, and its
               knowledge dwindleth, and the light of instruction is withheld from it; and so long as
               the body is found, the soul is lost, and so long as the body enjoyeth health, the
               soul is sick.</p>
            <p>Whosoever, then, seeketh to find his soul, must deliver his body unto the destruction
               of all afflictions, and behold, he will find his soul in the destruction of his body,
               and the health of the man of the spirit in the sickness of the carnal man, even as
               <persName>Paul</persName> also testifieth, saying, <quote>When I am sick, it is then that I am
               strong.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n445-1"/></p>
            <p>Now when two opposing parties are engaged in battle with each other, so long as their
               hosts are equal in number and are equally skilled in the art of war, there will be
               fighting between them continually, for they will always be conquered and conquering,
               and taking and giving the victory to each other, and plucking triumphs each from
               each, and giving them back each <pb n="446"/>to each, and by reason of their equality
               constant war will be produced between them. In this manner then are also the soul and
               body towards each other, and as their natures are contrary to each other, even so
               also are their wills, and concerning this hath <persName>Paul</persName> also said, <quote>The body lusteth
               after that which will harm the spirit, and the spirit lusteth after that which will
               harm the body, and both are contrary, each to each.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n446-1"/> And so long as they
               stand in this measure of equality, they will be at constant and unceasing war, and at
               one time the body will conquer the soul, and at another the soul will overcome the
               body; and <pb type="external" n="466"/>whosoever fighteth thus must stand in his
               place, for although he step forward even so little towards that which belongeth to
               the soul, the body hangeth on to him and turneth him back, and, moreover, it will
               even thrust him from his position, and drag him down into the abyss of sin. And
               during these ascents and descents, and goings and comings, a man must not depart from
               his place, or he will not be able to grow in the stature which hath been given unto
               him by God that he may increase unto spiritual life thereby.</p>
            <p>Now therefore if these, the motions of whose lives stand in equality of soul and
               body, are not able to grasp the victory and to go forth unto the end of the journey
               of their life and conduct, how can those who live in the body, and who feed it
               continually, and give it the fulness of its wants, and feed it as it were to
               transgress, and give it as much drink as it desireth, and make it to sink under the
               weight of sleep, be able to grasp the victory against the passions, and to arrive <pb
                  n="447"/>at the end of the Christian path along which they travel? For those who
               thus feed themselves, and who take care for their bodies in this manner, are not only
               unable to conquer sin, but their soul dieth and perisheth wholly and entirely, and
               their bodies become graves unto their souls, and their souls are buried within them
               like bodies in a grave, and they perceive not at all the life which is in them, <pb
                  type="external" n="467"/>and if there be in them the movement of life it is all on
               the behalf of the body. Now when the soul killeth the body, the work belongeth unto
               the soul in every particular, but if the body kill the soul, it thinketh, and acteth,
               and speaketh like a living being, and the soul dwelleth within it like a dead thing
               which perceiveth not at all; and if it thought that it liveth—because the nature of
               the soul is immortal—it liveth to the body and not to itself.</p>
            <p>Take away then from the body, and give to the soul, but take not away from the soul
               that thou mayest give to the body, and according to that which was promised should
               happen unto thee by thy Creator, so do thou thyself unto thyself. For this hope, that
               thy body should be exalted unto the grade of thy soul by the resurrection, was given
               unto thee, and not the expectation that the soul should be brought down to the
               deadness of the body and the corruption thereof, for it hath been said unto thee,
               <quote>One half of thee shall live with the other half,</quote> and not <quote>The portion which is
               superior in thee shall not perish with that which is inferior.</quote> So then lift thou up
               the power of thy body upon thy soul, and change and mingle the life thereof with the
               life of the soul, that its mortal life may be preserved with its immortal life, and
               its feeble power may be mingled with the might of its spiritual power. And instead of
                  <pb n="448"/>allowing the grave to bring thy body to an end, and to dissolve and
               scatter the constitution of thy members, take thou the portions of its members
               through the common labours of all the members, and lay them upon the soul, and when
               it goeth forth from thee through the dissolution of death, it shall not <pb
                  type="external" n="468"/>depart by itself, but shall bear upon itself all that
               belongeth unto the body, the strength of the body in its strength, the life of the
               body in its life, the carnalness of the body in its spirituality, and the members and
               senses of the body, together with all the labour of their ministration, in all the
               spiritual members of the soul.</p>
            <p>Now this strife is of use unto us—especially to conquer therewith—from the beginning
               of our youth. For from the beginning of the foundation of the childhood of the
               children of men this passion cleaveth unto their lives, and maketh to shoot up in all
               stages of their growth the passions which are peculiar unto them. In children, and in
               gray-haired men, in youths and in old men this passion begetteth wrath, and
               indignation, and constant annoyance, and rage; but in the other periods which fall
               between [youth and age], of young manhood, and the prime of life, it begetteth
               fornication, and empty pleasures, and the lust for money, and the lust for power, and
               other such like things, and according to the order of the periods [of life] it is
               meet that the forms of fighting should be changed. In the period of childhood, since
               it is below the knowledge of the prudent, it is meet that children should be
               restrained from the service of this lust by the power of the law, and they should be
               instructed by teachers and masters to perform the practice of abstinence—even though
               it be heavy upon them, and they be not <pb n="449"/>pleased therewith—and they should
               be constrained to perfect it that they may acquire a good habit, and be trained to
               endure patiently from <pb type="external" n="469"/>their youth up; and when they have
               arrived at the age which begetteth knowledge, they will feel the experience of their
               patient endurance, and will taste the sweetness of this victory. And the childhood
               which hath from the beginning been accustomed to learn that which is good, and hath
               been exercised in the training of patient endurance, is like a field which hath been
               cultivated and sown from its earliest times, that at the fitting season it may yield
               the fruits of knowledge.</p>
            <p>And what shall I say in respect of children? Unto those of all ages, and even also
               unto perfect and fullgrown men, the knowledge of contests appeareth not at the times
               when their thoughts are disturbed by fighting in the contests, but when they have
               ceased to war then they perceive [their] knowledge; if then the knowledge be found
               with them at the time when they are fighting, how they shall fight belongeth unto
               their knowledge, that is to say, the knowledge of the delivery of the law, which is
               established by hearing, and by tradition, and by doctrine, and by word, and not that
               knowledge of the spirit which shineth naturally upon the soul, and bringeth forth
               words without the remembrance of the tradition. And as the eye by its activity
               receiveth the vision of the clearness of light, even so also doth the sight of the
               soul receive, after the conquest of the carnal passions, the purity and simplicity of
               the knowledge of the spirit; and as the simple sun shineth upon things in nature, and
               upon diverse bodies, and he seemeth to them <pb type="external" n="470"/>divisible
               and separate, although he is of one single nature, and there is no division in him,
                  <pb n="450"/>even so also is it with the knowledge of the spirit when it shineth
               upon the rule, and conduct, and labours of life, for it seemeth to them separate and
               divisible, although in itself it is simple. Now the soul is not worthy to receive the
               brilliance of this light, except a man be first of all born from carnality to
               spirituality, the birth itself being perfected by labours and afflictions, for,
               <quote>Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n450-1"/> the blessed <persName>Paul</persName>
               teacheth us, or as a man might say, <quote>So long as the motions of a man are established
               by flesh and blood he is unable to inherit the spiritual knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>,</quote>
               which, as in a parable, he calleth the kingdom of heaven; and although this verse
               hath other meanings in respect of other passions, yet as regardeth the matter which
               is under discussion we may suitably apply it with this meaning. For the true kingdom
               is the knowledge which erreth not, and doubteth not, but seeth everything in its
               proper place distinctly, as well as things which are above nature, according to the
               capacity which is given unto created beings; and he whose life is established by
               means of motions of flesh and blood is unable to become the heir of this knowledge,
               and if it happen that he receive it by the tradition of words, he heareth the words
               from others, and it is not that <pb type="external" n="471"/>knowledge which itself
               hath revealed itself in his soul, for this knowledge is beyond words, and beyond
               appellations and names, as the demonstration of the Holy Children who were reared in
               <placeName>Babylon</placeName> testifieth unto us. Now those children, although they acquired human
               learning by the word of instruction, yet longed earnestly to <pb n="451"/>receive the
               divine knowledge, which was above oral tradition, and which revealed itself unto them
               at the fitting season, and that which human learning could not know this knowledge
               taught unto those children, and it was shewn unto them because they travelled towards
               it in the way of this knowledge according to the law. For although their food was
               allowed them from the royal table, and they were ordered to take the meat which
               befitted those who received royal instruction, they rejected it because they
               perceived that it gave increase unto worldly knowledge, and that clean and pure meats
               were necessary for those who received human instruction, that their bodily senses
               might be pure and active according to the purity of their food. Now spiritual
               knowledge hath no need of these things, because it holdeth nothing of the
               perspicacity of carnal senses in the soul, but when all parts of the soul have been
               purified and cleansed from evil passions, then this knowledge riseth therein.</p>
            <p>Now pure meats are helpful and beneficial in no slight degree to the activity of the
               senses of those who receive the knowledge of the soul, but spiritual beings <pb
                  type="external" n="472"/>have no need of anything thereof, and that thou mayest
               know that this is so, accept the testimony of these pure children, who instead of the
               royal, pure, and clean meats which give to the body solid and substantial
               nourishment, chose pulse and the drinking of water, for the might of the former food
               is a hindrance unto those who receive human learning. And because they were not
               refined in their bodies, but in their souls, they chose vegetable food that their
               bodies might become meagre, and the strength and the natural power of their members
               might be reduced, and <pb n="452"/>that after these things the living parts of the
               soul might be revealed unto the perception and sight of divine knowledge. And this
               actually took place, for after they had eaten pulse and drunk water for three years
               this knowledge was revealed unto them, not that which is born of words, but that
               which is born of deeds, for they were doing the works which gave birth unto the
               knowledge of the spirit, while they were learning the words which gave birth unto
               human knowledge; but because their expectation was directed unto the revelation of
               that knowledge which ariseth from works and not unto that which ariseth from words,
               where they looked they saw, and where they expected they received, and they became a
               medium for words, and receptive vessels of the knowledge of the spirit. And thou must
               understand from this matter that not merely did they eat pulse and drink water only,
               but they took this abstemious food after prolonged fasting, for whosoever eateth
               pulse is constant <pb type="external" n="473"/>in fasting also, and whosoever
               drinketh water is clean for pure prayer at all seasons, if the object of his
               abstinence be therefor. And thou must understand from the passage that when the time
               arrived in which that knowledge was to shew itself in them, they clave to abstinence,
               and fasting, and prayer, and then the revelations for which they asked were shewn
               unto them, for <persName>Daniel</persName> told his companions to entreat the God of heaven to reveal
               this mystery unto them in order that he and his brethren might not perish, together
               with all the other wise men of <placeName>Babylon</placeName>; and then unto <persName>Daniel</persName>, in a vision of the
               night, was the mystery revealed.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n452-1"/> This then is the gift which abstinence gave
               unto the Children, and this <pb n="453"/>is the harvest which they gathered in from
               the fields which had been sown with pulse and which had drunk in water. Run thy
               course then, O disciple, as did they, that like them thou mayest be able to restrain
               thyself and to go forth into a wide place; make thyself little that thou mayest be
               able to go through the narrow gate; drink water that thou mayest drink knowledge;
               feed upon pulse that thou mayest become wise in mysteries; eat by measure that thou
               mayest overcome without measure; fast that thou mayest see; this is the meat which
               belongeth to thee, because it is also thy discipleship, for according to this [hast
               thou] promised. For dainty meats and fulness of the belly belong not to thee, but
               unto those who live in wickedness in the world, and who at all seasons produce the
               brambles and thorns of sin, for the person who is sown with dainties and who drinketh
               wine is accustomed to yield fruit like unto these things; but of the eating of pulse
               and of the drinking <pb type="external" n="474"/>of water the harvest is heavenly
               visions and revelations, and the knowledge of the spirit, and divine wisdom, and the
               interpretation of hidden things, and that which human knowledge perceiveth not, but
               the soul which laboureth in such like things perceiveth it. And moreover from thy
               youth up abide in the rule of labours, and say not, <quote>I am a child,</quote> because thou wilt
               be taken as an example of what children [can do]. And besides, according to the
               indication of the history of the Book those beloved ones were only children of a few
               years of age when they began this divine service, and they found it out without being
               taught,—do thou, since thou hast teachers, practise this [habit]—for their teachers
               were persuading them to do the contrary, that is to say, to eat and to drink—now the
                  <pb n="454"/>divine doctrine counselleth thee, on the contrary, to love the rule
               of abstinence, and to lay hold upon patient endurance—and those children, without
               being obliged or required to do so, by their own discernment chose these things. And
               thou, if thou wilt do as they did, wilt pay what is due from thee, and thou wilt
               fulfil thy promise by the word of God which thou hast.</p>
            <p>Rouse thyself then, and observe these children of the Old Testament, who being born
               of one mother sucked the milk of another, for while the Old Testament brought them
               forth to the belief of God, they fulfilled the rule of life of the New Testament, and
               the milk of their mother was not sweet unto them, but they longed earnestly to suck
               from the breasts which suckle thee, <pb type="external" n="475"/>and they lusted for
               the meat of thy table. And thou, when thou doest these things, wilt do that which
               belongeth unto thee to do, and where thou wast produced there wilt thou be reared,
               and the laws which thou art bound to keep thou wilt keep—for thy choice itself
               proclaimeth labours, and afflictions, and abstinence, and the subjugation of the
               body—and after these things there will come upon thee the pleasures which are born
               therefrom, happiness, and joy, and confidence, and all these are above the world, and
               before the coming of the kingdom thou wilt inherit the kingdom. For whosoever
               purifieth and cleanseth his body by affliction and severe labours, and also his soul
               from wickedness, shall inherit the kingdom before the time of the kingdom, and before
               the coming of the glorious and universal revelation the glory thereof will be
               revealed unto him by his soul, and he himself will become the fountain of his
               knowledge, because he is about to be held worthy in heaven of the kingdom, and
               because he will find in <pb n="455"/>himself the kingdom. For behold, <quote>The kingdom of
               God is within you,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n455-1"/> and in another place [the Book] saith, <quote>Repent, for the
               kingdom of heaven is at hand,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n455-2"/> and two things are certain: the kingdom of
               heaven which the righteous shall inherit at the end of the world, above the heavens,
               and the kingdom which is in you, which is the knowledge of the spirit which is
               revealed unto spiritual beings, and as it were, we have already been in the kingdom
               of heaven in unspeakable happiness. Now neither of these can be found without
               afflictions and labours of the body, for those who bear labours in the body are heirs
               of the kingdom of heaven, <pb type="external" n="476"/>and those who, together with
               labours, possess innocency of soul also, become the discoverers of the kingdom which
               is in them, and in its blessings they fare luxuriously and revel in continual joy,
               over which sorrow ruleth not, because at all times they rejoice in the gladness which
               is born of them, even as <persName>Paul</persName> also said, <quote>Rejoice at all times,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n455-3"/> and in
               another place he also said, <quote>Rejoice in your hope, and endure patiently your
               tribulations; for from the patient endurance of tribulations the hope concerning the
               things which are to come increaseth in us,</quote> even as he said in another place,
               <quote>Tribulation perfecteth patience in us; and patience, probation, and probation, hope;
               and patience putteth not to shame.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n455-4"/></p>
            <p>Whosoever beareth not tribulations by his own constancy, in him it is evident that
               the remembrance of hope is not, for if he had hope, he would also be in tribulation
               because of his hope, even as all the <pb n="456"/>righteous who have come into the
               world were in tribulation with all kinds of labours, and in many afflictions they
               trod this path which leadeth to the kingdom of God; and because they trod it in hope
               the experience of the afflictions was pleasant unto them. Now the beginning of the
               way of tribulations unto them all was abstinence, even as the greed of the belly is
               the beginning of all wickedness, for from this very place two paths begin; from the
               love of the belly the path [which goeth to] the left, and from the hatred of the
               belly <pb type="external" n="477"/>the path [which goeth to] the right. And whosoever
               wisheth to begin the path of discipleship in good order, must start herefrom,
               afflicting and buffeting his body, and reducing its meat and drink, and loading it
               with the toils of vigil, and with the tribulations of fasting; and when its lusts are
               cut off it will become light and active for the business of the soul. Now the work of
               afflictions is not so hard as report saith, for a report from afar usually terrifieth
               every man, but when he hath tried and hath had experience of the matters in very
               deed, they become easy unto those who do them.</p>
            <p>To thee then, O thou who hast cast off the world, belong the things which will help
               thee greatly, and which will give thee power [to lead] the good life, for the fact of
               being removed from the affairs of the world, and from the sight and hearing thereof,
               keepeth thy life holy in no small degree. The beloved Children,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n456-1"/> the example
               of whom I have brought before thee, although the royal table was set before their
               sight, rejected its pleasures, and chose tribulations instead of delights. </p>
            <pb n="457"/>
            <p>And herefrom consider the power of their patient endurance, for having no teacher to
               admonish, and none to help or encourage, nor the pattern of others who were before
               them, nor the fear of the law upon them, nor want and need, nor fear and terror which
               restrained them, nor being removed from the sight of meats—which also is helpful to
               patient endurance—having <pb type="external" n="478"/>none of these [reasons, I say],
               they filled themselves with the power of their patient endurance. Do thou then, even
               though all these things help thee, persevere in the patience which befitteth thy
               discipleship, and conquer the wicked mistress of all iniquity, and subdue thy body
               and afflict thy members, even as <persName>Paul</persName> also said, <quote>I subdue my body, and bring it
               into subjection, lest peradventure I, who have preached to others, am myself
               rejected.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n457-1"/> And if <persName>Paul</persName>, although he, by the power of Grace, gained the
               victory over the passions, still had need to subdue his body, how much more have
               those, in whom there still live the lusts of the flesh, need to subdue their bodies
               by fasting and abstinence, and to fight and to overcome!</p>
            <p>Unto thee then, O disciple, if thou wishest thy discipleship to be good, let the
               table, which unto others is a place of pleasure, be a place of fighting, and set in
               array thereupon the battle against all meats, whether they be great or little, or
               rare or common, and despise not lust, because it is laid hold upon by small matters,
               and think [not] that it is not worthy of blame, for thou wilt be especially
               blameworthy if it happen that thou art overcome by small things, even more so than if
               thou wert conquered by great things, for if lust can <pb n="458"/>vanquish thee by
               little things, how much more shall it defeat thee by great? <pb type="external"
                  n="479"/>And if it conquereth thee by garden herbs, how much more shall it
               overcome thee by the meat of flesh? Whosoever will commit iniquity in a small thing
               will also commit iniquity in a great thing. Now with that with which lust doeth
               battle with thee must thou overcome it: if it be with the meat of flesh, and the
               various preparations of meat and dainty foods, fight therewith and vanquish the lust
               of the belly, and if it be with pulse, and garden herbs, and valueless and common
               fruits, with that very thing with which lust fighteth do thou oppose victory. And say
               not, <quote>To conquer these things is no victory at all,</quote> but consider that if thou be
               vanquished by these things the defeat will be great. What then? And if it be that
               that lust which is wont at all times to lust after great things, abaseth itself and
               lusteth after small things in order that it may subdue thee, do not thou abase
               thyself with it, but conquer it wherever it seeketh to conquer thee. For wherever it
               calleth there art thou bound to follow after it, and against that thing which it
               lusteth after, do thou set in array the battle against the incentives thereto, being
               in this respect like unto <persName>Christ thy Lord</persName>, Who, wherever <persName>the Tempter</persName> sought to
               tempt Him, was found present with him, and wherever he wished to enter into battle
               with Him, there did He respond unto him. And He began first of all the war which was
               against the greediness of the belly, and He overcame this lust by the patient
               endurance of fasting, that He might give unto us also an example, and lay down for us
               the law, so that we, if we desired to enter upon a spiritual rule of life and conduct
                  <pb type="external" n="480"/>might begin with fasting, and after <pb n="459"
               />that, little by little, we might advance unto all triumphs. For also <persName>our Lord</persName>
               first of all vanquished the lust of the belly, and after it the love of money, and
               the empty boasting of the world, and dominion and power—which things are born
               therefrom—and after these He conquered vain-glory—an abominable passion which is born
               of fine things—and by these three He overcame and brought to nought all the passions
               which cleave unto them, and then He began to preach the kingdom of His Father with
               power, and to deliver the doctrine of perfection unto the children of men.</p>
            <p>Now as <persName>Christ our Lord</persName>, when He had finished the service of the Law and had begun
               the rule of the spirit, began with fasting, even so also like Him art thou bound to
               make the beginning of thy discipleship, which is above the world therewith. For what
               abstinence could be as perfect as that of <persName>Jesus</persName>? Who not only made himself a
               stranger unto the taste of meats, but also unto the smell and sight thereof, in that
               He forsook the peaceful state in which these are found, and went forth into the
               wilderness, and deprived Himself of everything, in order that He might cut off and
               cast out from all the senses this abominable lust; for except a man go forth from the
               world he cannot tread the path of perfection. And consider also that <persName>our Redeemer</persName>
               protracted His fast unto the last limit to which our nature could attain! Now <persName>Moses</persName>
               and <persName>Elijah</persName> did also tread [that path], and attain to this number [of days], and if
               our nature had been able to go beyond it, <persName>our Redeemer</persName> would have fasted more, and
               also if <pb type="external" n="481"/>its strength had been insufficient to arrive at
               this number [of days], He would have diminished the number of the days which He
               fasted, <pb n="460"/>and would have limited Himself to the time up to which human
               nature could endure. For <persName>our Lord</persName> did not fast according to His strength, but
               according to our strength, for if He had fasted according to His own strength He
               would never have hungered at all, for the nature of His spirituality was not to
               hunger; but He fasted according to the body according to the capacity of the power of
               carnal beings, and He brought Himself down to us, and revealed unto us the limits of
               His natural endurance.</p>
            <p>Now the power of endurance hath become weak in us by reason of a multitude of
               dainties, and we think that without these our nature cannot live, and that if we
               diminish these dainties and supports of meat it will perish. <persName>Our Lord</persName> fasted forty
               days, and hath [thus] taught us that the power of our natural endurance can be
               prolonged unto this point, if the barriers of lust be not placed in the way to cut
               off the way of endurance; but <persName>our Redeemer</persName> broke through and passed over all the
               barriers of lusts and the endurance of sicknesses and diseases, and arrived at the
               end of the forty days, therefore unto this point have very many arrived, but beyond
               the limit which <persName>our Redeemer</persName> fixed hath no man passed, because it is the natural
               one. If then it hath been heard or said that a man hath passed this limit, it is
               beyond the power of human nature to do so, and it hath been performed solely by
               Grace, <pb type="external" n="482"/>because of many reasons, some of which are hidden
               from us, and some of which are manifest unto us.</p>
            <p>Now therefore it is meet that the disciple should place this example before his eyes,
               if he wisheth to be prosperous in the spiritual life, and as <persName>our Lord</persName> <pb n="461"
               />overcame the other passions, even so also for thee after abstinence will it be easy
               to vanquish the other lusts. And as after all lusts had been overcome <persName>Jesus</persName> began
               the teaching of authority, and the life of freedom, to eat with all men, to be
               invited by all men, and to mix with, and to talk with all [kinds of] people, which
               things are a sign of absolute freedom, even so also shalt thou stand in the freedom
               of <persName>Christ</persName>, when thou hast mastered the lust of the belly, and the other passions
               which follow in its train thereby, and shalt mingle with and talk to every one with
               authority, and thou shalt eat and drink with tax-gatherers and whores, and thou shalt
               converse fearlessly with women, thy freedom making no distinction between male and
               female, because thou hast cast off that thought which by reason of the passions seeth
               the difference between them; for when the mind is not goaded by passion it
               distinguished not between the person of a man or woman, nor between a beautiful face
               and an ugly one, but without passion it meeteth all and regardeth all alike. And
               without fear thou shalt enter into every [house], and thou shalt salute every man,
               and thou shalt be all things unto all men, being thyself without change, for the
               benefit of all. Now the patterns of these things <pb type="external" n="483"/>have
               been seen in <persName>Christ</persName> and in His disciples. And thou must observe that unto these and
               such like things <persName>our Redeemer</persName> arrived through abstinence, and not only Himself, but
               also the holy Apostles, and the divine Prophets, and also <persName>John the Baptist</persName> who came
               between the two Covenants. And remember how the Holy Book recounteth unto thee
               concerning his abstinent rule of life, which was new and different from that of all
               the other children of men, for his clothing was of <pb n="462"/>camel's
               hair,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n462-1"/> and skin girded his loins, like the prophets, and his food was locusts
               and wild honey, and his dwelling-place was the desert wilderness which was destitute
               of peace, and he lived among the beasts of the wilderness. And from his youth up he
               fulfilled all this stern life of abstinence, and after these things he was held to be
               worthy of the revelation, and to become a herald of the advent of the Highest, and
               before the Crucifixion to be equal unto those who were after the Crucifixion; and
               although as yet human nature was not born unto spirituality he alone was born thereto
               before the birth of all other men. And of this sight which is above speech, and the
               change which is to be wondered at and admired, together with the power of that Grace
               unto which everything is easy, he was held to be worthy by reason of his strict
               abstinence; for it is the nature of this rule of life that when purity of the soul is
               nigh thereunto, it giveth birth unto man that he may be in the world of the spirit,
               and a counterpart of the angels, although he still sojourneth in the world of the
               body.</p>
            <p>And besides this, then, thou must understand that the blessed Apostles, even though
               they had been chosen by divine Grace, <pb type="external" n="484"/>were not worthy of
               the gift of the Spirit until there had appeared in them first of all the life of
               abstinence, and behold, although they were going about with <persName>Jesus</persName> in the world, it
               is not written concerning them that they themselves observed the rules of abstinence,
               for through the abundance of Divine grace they led the life of the freedom of
               <persName>Christ</persName>, to which <persName>our Redeemer</persName> Himself came <pb n="463"/>after His temptation in
               the wilderness; and although in their course they had not as yet arrived at this
               point by temptation, <persName>Christ</persName> made them participators in His perfection. Now the
               Pharisees and the disciples of <persName>John</persName>, not having understood the power of this
               freedom, reproached <persName>Christ</persName> boldly, saying, <quote>Why do we fast so much, and thy
               disciples fast not?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n463-1"/> But <persName>Jesus</persName> made answer unto them in words the meaning
               of which was above the power of their understanding, saying, <quote>The children of the
               bride-chamber cannot fast so long as the bridegroom is with them, for as at a feast
               it is not only the bridegroom who is clothed in white, and who is occupied with
               pleasure, but also those who have been bidden to the feast, and similarly, it is not
               only I, Who, after the conquest and the payment of the debt of all sufferings having
               arrived at this freedom of the feast, rejoice and am glad, but also My disciples, who
               have been invited unto the kingdom, and them do I make to participate with Me; but
               the days shall come when I shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast in
               those days, <pb type="external" n="485"/>that is to say, when the full light of the
               power of free-will hath been gathered unto Me, then shall they also kindle the lamps
               of their endurance;</quote> and that there shall be a place for the spirit instead of the
               light [of which] <persName>Jesus</persName> [speaks] He himself will shine in their hidden places—which
               actually came to pass after His going up into heaven.</p>
            <p>Now although they lived beforehand the life of freedom, as a pledge, yet they did not
               receive this freedom in themselves until they had first of all laboured <pb n="464"
               />in the life of abstinence, for it is written concerning them that immediately <persName>our
               Redeemer</persName> was taken up they returned to that upper chamber in which they were
               abiding,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n464-1"/> and that they lived there with much fasting, and in close
               confinement, and with sincere prayers, and bitter weeping, and that afterwards they
               were held to be worthy to receive the Paraclete. And if from the ascension of
               <persName>Christ</persName> into heaven, unto the descent of the Spirit the days of their abstinence
               were few, we must learn that they also tarried in this service of fasting and
               abstinence after they had received the Spirit, and in every place is it written
               concerning them that they fasted and prayed. <quote>And while they were fasting and
               praying, the Holy Spirit said to them, Separate ye unto Me <persName>Paul</persName> and <persName>Barnabas</persName> for
               the work whereunto I have called them.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n464-2"/> And again the Apostles said when
               they wished to choose seven deacons, <quote>We will continue steadfastly in prayer, <pb
                  type="external" n="486"/>and in the ministry of the word;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n464-3"/> and again when
               <persName>Simon</persName> was bound in prison, it is written that the whole church prayed;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n464-4"/> and
               again it is written concerning <persName>Paul</persName>, that before he was baptized, and received the
               Holy Spirit, he neither ate nor drank for three days,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n464-5"/> nor rose up from his
               place, because he was lying upon his face praying, and thus he received the Holy
               Ghost. And he was occupied in fasting and prayer during the whole of the remaining
               period of his life after his election, even as he himself testifieth everywhere
               concerning his fasting, and his prayer, and his many <pb n="465"/>tribulations which
               he bore for the sake of the Gospel, and with all his other labours and afflictions he
               reckoned frequent fasting, saying, <quote>In fasting often, in watching often, in hunger
               often, in cold and in nakedness;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n465-1"/> and again he saith, <quote>I am trained in
               everything, both in fulness, and in hunger, in abundance, and in want.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n465-2"/> And
               to how much in want and poverty he was testify the fact that once until he had sold
               his clothing they were not able to buy food for him and for those who were with him,
               and the constant labour which he did with his hands at nights, in order that he might
               be a burden upon no man.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n465-3"/></p>
            <p>And concerning <persName>Simon</persName>, moreover, it is written that <quote>he went up to the roof to pray
               at the time of the ninth hour, and he was an hungered, and wished to eat,</quote> and he
               told [them] to make ready for him.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n465-4"/> And by this [example the Book] teacheth
               thee that, in addition to constant instruction, <pb type="external" n="487"/>and
               prayers at every hour, he prayed continually also at the stated seasons which [are
               those of] the common service, and that together with prayer was his fasting
               continual. That he was hungry and wished to eat at the ninth hour [sheweth] that his
               hunger arose from Divine dispensation and not from habit, and that he had not a rule
               for eating at that season, and it is evident from what he saith that when he went up
               to the roof to pray hunger suddenly fell upon him, and that he left his prayers and
               told them to prepare food for him. And if it had been the season when he was
               accustomed to eat, those who received him would have made ready for him according to
               [their] wont, but from the fact that he <pb n="466"/>commanded them to prepare for
               him, it is evident that he became hungry through Divine dispensation, that by the
               passion of his hunger he might receive the teaching of the things which were spoken
               unto him, his fasting being continual.</p>
            <p>And consider, the Apostles fasted not—now their rule of life is not suitable to come
               to testify unto thee, for when they had received the Spirit Paraclete they were
               perfect—and as <persName>our Lord</persName> did not fast after His temptation, so also was it not
               fitting for them to fast, according to the rule of freedom in which they stood, and
               the perfection in which they were. But although their spiritual rule of life was
               above labours, yet they descended to labours and afflictions, for one reason, that
               they might give us a good example, so that we might be like unto them, and for
               another, because they gratified their pleasure with tribulations and labours. Now of
               what did the food <pb type="external" n="488"/>of these great ones who arrived at
               perfection consist? When they had any did it not consist of bread, and garden herbs,
               and olives only? And if the Apostles had need of the rule of abstinence, and in the
               time of perfection lived like those who were in danger, who would not tremble and
               excuse himself from slackness, and run and lay hold of the rule of patient
               endurance?</p>
            <p>And thou must also understand from the testimony of the Prophets, that they too,
               whenever they were held worthy to receive a vision of God or of the angels, led a
               life of much fasting, and then were they worthy to receive the vision of revelations,
               even as it is written of that beloved man <persName>Daniel</persName>, that after his fast of three
               weeks he was wholly worthy of the sight <pb n="467"/>of angels.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n467-1"/> And if for
               that man who was looking for the advent of an angel all this fasting was necessary,
               and he was only then worthy to receive spiritual revelations, how much more for thee
               who awaitest the spiritual sight of <persName>Christ</persName>, and hopest to receive within thy soul
               the perception which is above nature, are much fasting, and abstinence, and the
               subduing of the body necessary, if thou wouldst arrive at things which are greater
               than those of <persName>Daniel</persName>?</p>
            <p>And so also <persName>Elijah</persName>, after his fast of forty days and forty nights,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n467-2"/>
               received the sight of God in <placeName>Mount Horeb</placeName>, and he was alone in the wilderness, and
               in addition to the protracted fast he bore also the labour of the journey of the way;
               and besides these he was shut off from the children of men, and [lived in] silent
               contemplation, and he was <pb type="external" n="489"/>in pure prayer, and after
               these things he heard the voice of God speaking with him. And like this holy man the
               blessed <persName>Moses</persName> also was twice<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n467-3"/> deemed worthy to go unto the thick darkness
               and to receive the law upon the tablets; and he was made pure by fasting like unto
               this, and then he was deemed worthy of the terrible sight. And the prophet
               <persName>Ezekiel</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n467-4"/> also, when he was about to receive the revelation of the prophecy
               of the uprooting of the city and the overthrowing of the temple, did the word of God
               bring into severe tribulations to eat bread by weight, and to drink water by measure,
               and to sleep upon his side in affliction—and then he arrived at the vision of
               prophecy. And thus also thou canst [shew] that all the righteous men and Prophets,
               either by <pb n="468"/>their own will, or by God's command unto them, endured always
               tribulations and labours, even as the blessed <persName>David</persName> maketh known that from the
               severity of his fasting the very limbs of his body had become enfeebled, saying, <quote>My
               knees have become sick through fasting, and my flesh faileth of fatness;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n468-1"/>
               and again he saith, <quote>For I have forgotten to eat my bread, and by reason of the voice
               of my groanings my flesh cleaveth unto my bones.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n468-2"/> It was not sufficient for
               him, through his remembrance of God to turn away from [his] natural food, but he
               forgot entirely this corruptible food because his mind was meditating upon that which
               belonged to the spirit; and by reason of the severity of his labours and
               tribulations, and through the pain and grief of his groanings his flesh clave to his
               bones.</p>
            <p>And again, he teacheth thee also concerning <pb type="external" n="490"/>that which
               he took as a preparation for his meat, saying, <quote>For I have eaten ashes like
               bread:</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n468-3"/> these were the condiments and dainties which were laid upon the
               table of this righteous king when he ate his food. Listen also concerning the
               strained wine which he drank: <quote>I have mingled my drink with tears.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n468-4"/> Behold
               the meat and drink of the righteous king! He fed himself upon ashes, and his drink
               was tears of suffering. What disciple on hearing these things will not break his
               heart in sorrow for his slothful life, if indeed he be a disciple? And again <persName>David</persName>
               saith, <quote>I have humbled my soul in fasting, and I have become unto them a reproach. I
               have made sackcloth my clothing, and I have become unto them a byword:</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n468-5"/> and
               by this <pb n="469"/>he teacheth us that he not only endured the labour of good
               deeds, but that he also heard reproaches and indignant words because thereof, and
               endured them patiently; from which thou also mayest learn that if thy labours are
               despised by the slothful, and thy tribulations are repeated mockingly by those who
               love pleasure, thou must remember these words and be comforted, and let them be a
               support for thy soul when irritation at the wicked cometh upon thee. And again, in
               another place, he telleth unto what severity of labours he had arrived in the patient
               endurance of his tribulations, saying, <quote>I have become like a skin bottle in the ice,
               but I have not forgotten Thy commandments;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n469-1"/> and by this he teacheth thee <pb
                  type="external" n="491"/>that through excessive meagreness and dryness even the
               moisture of his body had dried up and come to an end. And again listen unto him, for
               he teacheth thee in another place that before a man hath gone through tribulations
               and hath been tried in the furnace of enduring labours patiently, he cannot go forth
               into the wide place of spiritual happiness, saying, <quote>Thou hast brought me through
               fire and water, and hast brought me out into a wide place;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n469-2"/> now he likeneth
               unto fire and water the afflictions, and wickedness, and labours which surround him
               on all sides, whether the afflictions arose from his own will, or from the
               chastisement of God which took place to try him, or from the wicked men who envied
               him his good works.</p>
            <p>And besides this righteous king, listen also unto the words of the spiritual athlete
               <persName>Job</persName>, whom the healing of the spirit taught what manner of thing he should set <pb
                  n="470"/>upon his table before his food, <quote>For my sighing entereth in before I eat,
               and my roarings are poured out like water;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n470-1"/> these are the fruits which he
               took before [his food]—groanings and weeping—and then he drew nigh [to eat] his
               natural food, for he ate first of all suffering, and drank the tears of his
               groanings, and then he took his carnal food, from which also [we may learn] that that
               which he ate was consecrated and not ordinary food. Hear also from him what
               tribulations he bore and yet did not depart from the love of God: <quote>Why have I taken
               my flesh in my teeth, and [why] is my soul laid in my hands? Even if He slay me, it
               is for Him only that I will wait,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n470-2"/> <pb type="external" n="492"/>as if a man
               were to say, Even though He love me not, yet will I not depart from His love. God
               punished him like an enemy, yet he cried out, <quote>I am smitten by a friend,</quote> and he
               denied not the love of Him that punished him. And everywhere, if thou seekest, O
               disciple, thou wilt find that none of the righteous pleased God in the world without
               tribulations and labours, for this is the road of the royal city which is above, and
               that <quote>strait and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n470-3"/></p>
            <p>Let us travel then, in the narrow path which God hath trodden for us, and let us walk
               in the way of the tribulations which He hath shewn us. Let us restrict ourselves
               here, that we may live in freedom there; let us hunger here, that we may be filled
               there; let us diminish our food and drink [here], that we may have spiritual food in
               abundance there; let us take ourselves into the furnace of tribulations, that we may
               be given unto <pb n="471"/>the kingdom as pure gold in which there is no blemish; let
               us not spare the destruction of our body, that our inner man may be renewed day by
               day. Let us not think anxiously about the pains and sicknesses which will befall
               [us], but let us think that if things be not thus the wounds of the soul cannot be
               healed; let us be filled with joy in running our course, because it is known that we
               hasten after hope. Let us labour like sons of grace for the Father of truth, that we
               may be worthy of that inheritance which is filled with blessings, and is promised
               unto sons, and let us always remember the word of <persName>the Apostle</persName>, <quote>By tribulation it
               is meet that we should enter the kingdom of God,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n471-1"/> and with the Apostle let
               us say each to each, <quote>If we suffer with <persName>Christ</persName>, <pb type="external" n="493"/>we
               shall be glorified with <persName>Christ</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n471-2"/> and if we endure [with Him], we shall also
               reign with Him;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n471-3"/> to Whom be glory from us all, for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
            <p>Here endeth the Eleventh Discourse, which is on Abstinence. </p>
