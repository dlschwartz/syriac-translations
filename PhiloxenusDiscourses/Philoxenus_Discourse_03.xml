            <head type="title">The Third Discourseâ€”On Faith</head>
            <p>And again come, O disciple, and hearken unto the triumphs of faith which are much to
               be desired. Come and incline thine ear to the voice of thy mother who giveth thee
               life by the sweet music of her voice. Come and suck the sweet milk of doctrine from
               the living breast of the mother who bore thee. Come and stand by the fountain which
               watereth nations and tribes, for whosoever drinketh not from her his thirst is not
               quenched, Come and sit at the table which is full of the food of life, for whosoever
               feedeth not therefrom hath no life in his life. Come and incline thine ear and hear;
               come, open thine eyes and see the wonderful things which have been manifested by
               faith. Come, hew out for thyself new eyes; come, establish for thyself secret ears;
               to hear secret things thou art invited, therefore secret ears are necessary for thee;
               and to see spiritual things thou art called, therefore eyes of the spirit are useful
               for thee. Come, look upon thyself [as] something which thou art not, and renew
               thyself before thou shalt be made new. The Creator hath made thee a new creation, and
               faith hath helped in the making of thee; thou hast become a change of wonder and a
               construction of heaven, and faith was with Him when He established thee. <pb
                  type="external" n="53"/>For in the beginning when He created the world and <pb
                  n="50"/>all that therein is, and when He was establishing things, wisdom worked
               with Him, even as <persName>Solomon</persName> saith, <quote>The Lord by His wisdom laid the foundations of
               the earth, and He constructed the heavens by His understanding; and by His knowledge
               were the depths broken up, and the clouds distilled water.</quote> And again wisdom saith,
               <quote>When He constructed the heaven I was with Him, and when He made a circle upon the
               face of the deep, and when He made firm the clouds from above, and when the fountains
               of the depths became strong</quote>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n50-1"/> Now wisdom was with God in His primaeval works,
               but in this second creation faith is with Him; and in this second giving of birth He
               hath taken to Himself faith as a helpmeet. In everything faith cleaveth to God, and
               without it to-day He worketh no new things. It were an easy thing for Him to give
               thee birth from water and spirit without it, but until it is satisfied He doth not
               give thee new birth. He is able to make thee a new creature, and from being old to
               make thee new, but until He receiveth from thee faith [as] a pledge He neither
               changeth thee nor maketh thee a new creature.</p>
            <p>From him that is baptized faith is required, and then he receiveth treasure from the
               water; but without faith everything is common. When faith hath come the most
               contemptible things appear glorious. Without faith baptism is water [only], and
               without faith the life-giving Mysteries are bread and wine [only]; and the old man
               appeareth as he is if it be not the eye of faith that seeth him. The Mysteries are
               common things, and marvellous things are to be despised <pb type="external" n="54"/>
               <pb n="51"/>if it be not the eye of faith which seeth them. The power of faith cannot
               be experienced by the test of words, but it must be felt in and from itself. Faith
               cannot be perfected by the hearing of the ear, but it must be made certain from
               within by the power of the soul. The ear only receiveth the report of faith, but the
               substance of faith is born from the mind. The pure understanding is a fountain which
               floweth with faith and a simple mind in which there is nothing else. For the mind of
               faith is single, and there is nothing therein which maketh contest against its
               neighbour. Faith regardeth secretly, and peereth, and looketh fixedly beyond unto the
               power which is buried in things.</p>
            <p>Now faith is more deeply seated within than knowledge, for that which knowledge seeth
               not by the faith which is therein is made manifest. Knowledge is not able to perform
               the work of faith, and when knowledge hath gone forth faith entereth in her place.
               For in respect of created things knowledge is external, but faith is within the thing
               itself. Knowledge investigateth the wisdom which is hidden deeply in creation, and
               faith looketh steadfastly at the hidden things of the Mysteries. Knowledge looketh
               through and through into the force which [is in] edible things and fruit, and in all
               the food which is given to the body, but faith looketh through and through into the
               power which is hidden in the life-giving Mysteries, which are the food of the soul.
               However refined knowledge may make itself it burroweth among corporeal things, and in
               the visible world it goeth round about and wandereth; but faith <pb type="external"
                  n="55"/>goeth not about among created things, and the power of created things is
               unable to receive it to dwell in them.</p>
            <p>The tongue cannot taste the power of faith, <pb n="52"/>and speech is unable either
               to declare its beauties or to describe and depict its similitudes. Its might cannot
               be experienced by the voice, neither can it be known by the speech, nor by the
               portion of the mind which turneth to the body; but within the place of the hidden and
               spiritual holy of holies of the understanding are the mysteries of faith made
               manifest, and secret things revealed. For that part which is within us and is more
               glorious than all [the other] parts of man, that part alone is able to perceive
               faith; now the works of faith are visible from without, and its words may be heard
               with the ears. And its power must be experienced in the understanding, for even if
               thou seest the dead rise, or the eyes of the blind opened, or the devils going forth
               [from a man], still thou hast not yet seen the power of faith. For how canst thou see
               the power of faith in a body which riseth, for behold it also maketh the soul alive
               from the dead? And how canst thou experience its power in the healing of the eyes of
               the body, for behold it also createth eyes for spiritual natures? And how canst thou
               see its power in the devils going forth, for behold it also driveth out of the soul
               natural thoughts? To those who are without the power of faith faith appeareth in
               external things, but man himself must experience it by the power of the soul. To the
               understanding faith giveth the experience of itself by nothing that is alien, but
               without the intervention of any alien thing faith lighteth upon it, and maketh it to
               experience <pb type="external" n="56"/>its power. To the soul within signs from
               without can never become means for the experiencing of faith, but faith itself
               dwelleth therein and maketh it glad, and enlighteneth and maketh its thoughts to
               rejoice; it maketh the light of its nature to rise within <pb n="53"/>it, and the
               soul admireth the new light which is shed upon it. For until faith maketh to turn and
               concentrateth the sight of the soul from every place it showeth not the soul the
               beauty of its nature, because the soul is unable to see it while its vision is
               distracted by other things. The natural vision of the soul becometh enfeebled when it
               is divided, and it looketh outside itself, and it becometh incapable of looking
               fixedly at the clear light of faith.</p>
            <p>Now to the soul which becometh unto it a pure dwelling-place faith giveth such power
               that it doth not look upon things as they are, but as it wisheth to see them. For
               behold thou bearest upon thy hands the live coal of the Mysteries, which in their
               nature are common bread, but faith seeth therein the body of the Only One.[a] The eye
               of faith seeth not as the eye of the body, but faith compelleth the vision of the
               body to see what is invisible to it. For the body seeth bread, and wine, and oil, and
               water, but faith compelleth it to see with its vision spiritually that which
               corporeally cannot be seen, that is to say, instead of bread we eat the Body, and
               instead of wine we drink the Blood, and instead of water we see the baptism of the
               Spirit, and instead of oil the power of <persName>Christ</persName>. <pb type="external" n="57"/>And
               faith possesseth the power of God, and the will and dominion of God are in it, and it
               gathereth together excellent things wheresoever it wisheth. Faith draweth nigh to the
               bones of the saints, and instead of dead men it looketh at them as living men, and
               speaketh with them as with the living, and entreateth them concerning its needs. For
               faith revealeth itself to the dead body in order that what it lacketh it may receive
               from the Giver of requests, and faith is persuaded that through <pb n="54"/>this dead
               body it will receive this gift, without considering that the dead body is without
               life, and silent, without speech, and still without voice, and incapable of movement,
               and a stranger to all the movements of nature. And faith doth not entreat the dead
               body to be a mediator by these things, for it knoweth that as concerns the things of
               its nature the dead body is insufficient in death, even as it was in life, to be a
               mediator for it with the Creator for this creation. But inasmuch as the dead body is
               superior to nature, and some of the power of <persName>Christ</persName> hath been mingled in the
               saints, and they also possess it, even though they are laid in the tomb, upon this
               faith looketh, and it entreateth the dead as if they were living, and speaketh unto
               those who are silent as unto those who have the power of speech.</p>
            <p>And the eye of faith putteth off the sight of all things that are visible, and
               putteth on the hidden sight of all spiritual things, and in every thing which is
               within the body it moveth. For man standeth in one place but looketh steadfastly at
               another; he sojourneth in the lower world of the body but dwelleth by faith in the
               world above. Faith heareth concerning the resurrection of the dead, and concerning
               the renewing of human bodies, <pb type="external" n="58"/>and it considereth that
               they have already risen and have been made new creatures. Faith hath received the
               promise concerning the world of life, and of the kingdom of light and of the
               countries of glory, and of spiritual delights, and of the food of the blessed, and of
               the interpretation of the Mysteries, and of becoming in the form of the angels, and
               having heard of these things they are accounted sure by it. And faith is an
               intermediary between the things which are <pb n="55"/>past and the things which are
               to come, for of all those things which took place before us, and those which are
               about to take place after us, we receive their teaching by faith, according to what
               is said by <persName>Paul</persName>, <quote>By faith we understand that the worlds have been constructed by
               the word of God, and that out of the things which are unseen these things which are
               seen have come into being.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n55-1"/></p>
            <p>If man possesseth not faith he is able to make all these things which are written in
               the Holy Books a lie, and he is able to say of all hidden things which most truly
               exist, that they exist not; and inasmuch as they are invisible there is not rebuke
               near at hand for [his] doubt; but faith needeth not a testimony whereby it may be
               certain of what it heareth. To knowledge proofs and testimonies are necessary, and to
               him that desireth first of all to see and to feel and then to be certain; but faith
               ariseth not from wonderful things. As God hath no need to receive persuasion by
               mighty deeds and wonders concerning the things which are about to come into existence
               from Him, to Whose knowledge aforetime everything is manifest and revealed, so
               neither <pb type="external" n="59"/>doth faith need wonders; for how can it be in
               need of that thing which it doeth? For behold, mighty deeds, and signs, and wonders
               and all such like things come into existence by faith; how then doth it need the
               testimony of that thing which it itself doeth to be certain of hidden things? As God
               needeth not the [testimony of] His works, in the same manner faith needeth not the
               [testimony of] the wonderful things which are <pb n="56"/>wrought by it. For faith
               needeth nothing, neither sight, nor feeling, nor signs and wonders, nor arguments and
               testimonies, but only the hearing of the word of God, and when it knoweth that it is
               God Who speaketh, straightway it receiveth it and doubteth not.</p>
            <p>And none of the righteous pleased God without faith, even as the teaching of <persName>Paul</persName>
               testifieth, who, beginning with <persName>Abel</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56-1"/> repeated all [their names] one after
               the other coming down unto the manifestation of <persName>Christ</persName>, and he showed that they all
               pleased God by faith. And setting a definite limit for all disciples he said,
               <quote>Without faith man cannot please God;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56-2"/> and again he said, <quote>In faith all these
               died, and did not receive their promises,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n56-3"/> for God considered aforetime help
               for us that they might not be perfected without us. And for their whole lives,
               according to the word of <persName>Christ</persName>, and until their departure [from this world] faith
               clave to them; by it they did mighty deeds while they were in the world, and by it
               they hoped and expected <pb type="external" n="60"/>to receive the promises which
               were about to be, and to receive what had been promised to them for [the sake of]
               which they went forth after His word. Faith is the ground which receiveth the seed of
               the word of God, and as the seed of the husbandman is empty of produce if it hath no
               field [in which to be sown], so also is the word of God, as far as we are concerned,
               barren of spiritual advantages if the ground of faith receive it not. And as the eye
               of the body [receiveth] the sun, even so doth the sight of faith receive the
               spiritual light of the commandments of <persName>Christ</persName>. And as by the light of the sun,
               which maketh <pb n="57"/>everything manifest, nothing can be seen unless the eye
               receiveth it, so also the commandment of God, Who is the Maker of everything, is not
               made certain to us without faith. The sun is a luminous body by nature, and the word
               of God is mighty when it giveth the command; but as the light of the sun's nature is
               diminished in power in respect of blind eyes, and maketh nothing visible, so also in
               the soul in which there is no faith is the commandment of God esteemed a feeble
               thing.</p>
            <p>Faith is the eye of discernment which looketh at everything, and it regardeth [a
               thing] as it is; and because the things which are visible are too small for its
               vision, it forsaketh them and looketh at those which are invisible, and it regardeth
               those things which are above nature, and beyond feeling, and is made known unto them.
               By faith also a name was established for us, because it gave us birth from error to
               the knowledge of God, <pb type="external" n="61"/>and for this reason every one, who
               would draw nigh to <persName>Christ</persName> and would become a disciple of His Gospel, taketh his
               name from faith, and is called Faithful one; for faith gave us birth and is our
               mother, and it is good that we should receive our name from her who gave us birth.
               And it is a wonderful thing unto what limit hath arrived the majesty of faith. For as
               the children of men also are called by the name of God and of His <persName>Christ</persName>, so also
               are we called godly men after the name of God, and Christians after the name of
               <persName>Christ</persName>[b], and we are named faithful after the name of Faith. This is the name
               which hath separated us from all false beliefs, and hath made us strangers to all
               doctrines of error. For no man is called faithful except him that <pb n="58"/>hath
               been born of true faith, and she is his mother and nurse, because our whole doctrine
               looketh at the hope of those things which are to come, and desireth the expectation
               of invisible things; and the things of which we have become disciples are neither
               manifest nor known unto these corporeal feelings. For these reasons it is good that
               we have been <quote>faithful,</quote> for the hope of all our good things standeth in faith, and
               if faith be removed from the way not one of these things which we have is to be
               believed.</p>
            <p>For behold, whether it be Mysteries which are in this world, or the good things
               beyond which are promised to us, it is faith which graspeth them and preserveth them.
               Now if a man were to look with the eye of the body and without faith upon all the
               mysteries of the service of the Church, he would consider them common and
               contemptible, while those which took their origin in [this] world would appear to be
               mightier <pb type="external" n="62"/>and more magnificent than our own. For behold
               with us is poverty, but with the world there are riches; with us there is disgrace,
               but with it glory; with us there is humility, but with it pride; with us there is
               inferiority, but with it dominion; with us there is indigence, but with it
               possessions; with us there is hunger, but with it satiety; with us there is want, but
               with it abundance; with us there are afflictions, but with it pleasures; with us
               there is subjection, but with it command; with us there is the <quote>narrow way,</quote> but with
               it the broad path; with us is the single garment which is limited by command, but
               with it are various kinds of fine raiment and apparel; with us is the order which
               restraineth us from our daily food, but with it are the treasures which are <pb
                  n="59"/>collected for generations and years; with us is the obligation to appear
               in neglect and contempt, but with it the appearance of pride and honour.</p>
            <p>All these things, and those which are like unto them, appear glorious to the world,
               and better in every respect than those which we have; but if we remove from the midst
               faith which is our true riches, even as our teacher <persName>Paul</persName> also testified concerning
               this in his word, <quote>If in this life [only] we have hope in <persName>Christ</persName>, of all men we are
               the most miserable.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n59-1"/> And again in another place<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n59-2"/> he saith, <quote>We are
               fools for <persName>Christ's</persName> sake, and sick, and despised, and dishonoured, and we have
               nothing.</quote> And while in this world in which we live we possess nothing, we hold
               everything in that which is ours, also according to the words of the
               <persName>Apostle</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n59-3"/> <quote>As having nothing, yet possessing all things;</quote> and to speak
               briefly, no one thing of ours <pb type="external" n="63"/>can be seen in this life
               without the eye of faith which alone can see it. For in this world our riches are not
               seen, nor our power, nor the various grades of our labour, nor our honours, nor our
               enjoyments, nor our kingdom, nor the mansions of pleasures, nor the sealed and hidden
               happiness which is laid up for us, nor the city of our habitation [which is] heaven,
               nor <placeName>Zion</placeName> the country of life which thirsteth and desireth to receive her children,
               nor our stored up treasures, nor the riches of our heavenly possessions, nor our
               freedom which is above all subjection, nor the fulness of all the good things which
               we are about to receive. For all these things of ours are hidden in this life, and
               they cannot be seen by <pb n="60"/>corporeal beings. Believing men by faith only can
               perceive them, and they look upon everything which is not seen, and they hear those
               voices which are not audible to the ear of the body, and they feel that which cannot
               be felt with the hand of the body, and they taste those things which cannot be tasted
               by the palate of the mouth, because inside, beyond all bodily senses, the perception
               of the spiritual good things which are promised to us is placed. And if we have no
               spiritual senses faith perceiveth with them even though they be not. Now if thou
               sayest, <quote>Behold the mysteries which are here are glorious,</quote> yet see, for without
               faith their glory cannot be perceived. And everything which we have received from
               [this] world and of which we make use according to the tradition which hath come down
               to us, if we look at it with the eye of the world, it is of the world; but if we
               perceive it by the eye of faith, <pb type="external" n="64"/>it is above the world.
               The temples of our houses of prayer are of the world because the buildings thereof
               are derived from the world and constructed [therein]; but they are spiritual things
               above the world, because they are types of that Church of the firstborn, whose
               [names] are inscribed in heaven, which is <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> the free, the mother of us
               all.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n60-1"/> And all the altars and all the other vessels of the service of the
               Mysteries, and everything with which we perform the Mysteries which have been
               delivered to us, according to natural origin are of the world; but by reason of the
               greatness of those things which are administered in them they are exalted and most
               high, and are esteemed by us as being above nature, for they <pb n="61"/>are the
               likeness of the living and spiritual powers which are in heaven, in which the service
               of the hidden Mysteries of God and of His will are perfected. And again those holy
               Mysteries which are performed by us for the redemption of our life are taken first of
               all from the world, for the bread and the wine which goeth up on the spiritual altar
               is of the world; but when the altar receiveth them, as the womb received the Word, it
               maketh them to be above the world, and to be the Body and living Blood of God Who is
               above the world. And thus also is it with the water which is [mixed] with the oil,
               with which the mystery of our baptism is performed, for both are taken from this
               world; but when the time hath arrived that those who are called to Grace should be
               born by and from them, the baptism of common oil and water becometh the womb and
               power which give birth to spiritual beings. For the dead sinner who hath gone down to
               baptism cometh up alive, <pb type="external" n="65"/>even as <persName>Christ</persName> [rose] from the
               grave on the third day; but instead of becoming alive on the third day like our
               <persName>Lord</persName>, the sinner is renewed by three baptisms in three names.</p>
            <p>And as our <persName>Lord</persName> after His resurrection departed to a spiritual life from the
               corporeal life which [He led] before His crucifixion, so also the man, who hath been
               quickened into life by baptism as from the grave, walketh in a new life according to
               the doctrine of <persName>Paul</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n61-1"/> Now we bury our dead after the manner of all other
               men, and the external appearance of our method of sepulture and burial is in no way
               different from that of the heathen and the Jews; but we, in the <pb n="62"/>hope of
               faith and in the expectation of the vivification of the dead, commit our dead to life
               and not to death, and according to our faith they are sent by us to heaven and not to
               hell. And the dead of those who err because the hope of faith is not found in them
               are sent to death and destruction.</p>
            <p>The mysteries of believing men are great and exalted, if one will draw nigh unto them
               with the mind of faith. And because the eye of the body was too small for the sight
               of our mysteries, another eye, that of faith, was given to us, which is sufficient to
               look at them and to see them as they shall be, and not as they are; and the things
               which are remote and which have been promised to us it seeth as if they were near,
               and they are not accounted afar off by it.</p>
            <p>Therefore must thou understand, O thou who wishest to become a disciple of <persName>Christ</persName>,
               that all our affairs are established by faith, and without faith neither can we be
               seen, nor the things which we have, nor those which come from us, nor those which are
               promised to be given, and they are as if they existed not. So then in the beginning
                  <pb type="external" n="66"/>of thy discipleship take to thyself faith, and go
               forth after God, for thou wilt not hear Him to keep His commandments unless thou dost
               first believe in Him. Now faith hath been planted and set in thee by the Creator,
               that thou mightest believe in Him by the faith which He placed in us. Turn not back
               then the power of faith, and by its means believe those things which are not; and
               instead of believing in these things which are fixed and abide for ever thou must
               believe in what is not fixed and in what remaineth not. For all the things which
               exist here in appearance pass away and are dissolved, according to the teaching of
                  <pb n="63"/>the Book;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n63-1"/> and all things which are promised and are about to
               come into being for the true believers, abide for ever, and they neither pass away
               nor are destroyed. Believe not then with that faith which is in thee in what passeth
               away, and deem it not an abiding thing, but thou shalt make use of faith in its
               fitting order, and shalt believe by it in spiritual things. For behold those who
               worship idols, and who consider stones, and blocks of wood, and all the natural
               substances of creation to be gods, also have faith within them, but they have changed
               its fair order, and instead of believing by it in God have believed in made idols,
               and have called them gods erringly, since they are not [gods]. For as long as faith
               believeth certainly in the things which are fitting thereunto it is faith; but if it
               believeth other things which are contrary, and thinketh them to be what they are not,
               it is thenceforth not faith <pb type="external" n="67"/>but error. And it was for
               this reason that God set faith in thy nature, that thou mightest believe only on Him,
               and through Him upon what He wisheth thee to believe and nothing else. For in that
               manner in which the recognition of God is placed within us naturally, even as the
               blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said, <quote>The notion of God is manifest in them, for God hath revealed it
               in them,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n63-2"/> is faith also naturally implanted in all our thoughts. But as the
               notion of God was fixed in them, although they worshipped not His nature, and
               honoured not His Being, yet they worshipped His name, and paid honour [to it] in all
               creation, because of natural faith, so we with the faith which is placed in us
               believe everything, and whithersoever our desire wisheth thither it <pb n="64"
               />turneth our faith, and it directeth the natural movements which are in us so that
               we may see them.</p>
            <p>If our desire seeketh in faith to believe, it believeth in God, and if it wisheth in
               faith, it believeth certainly in idols and devils; and if it seeketh the world of
               life it believeth that it will abide for ever, and for it it lusteth and seeketh
               eagerly; but if it desireth this world which shall be dissolved it believeth like a
               true believer, and it loveth it and runneth after it. For desire is the governor of
               faith, as it is also of all the other natural movements which are in us, and it is
               the director of everything, whether of external feelings or internal thoughts. <pb
                  type="external" n="68"/>And as eyes are given to us to see the beauties of
               creation, and ears to hear the divine commandments, and hands that they may be
               stretched out to good things, and feet to run to the trysting-places of excellent
               thingsâ€”now it is the will which changeth them to the opposite, and which maketh the
               limbs and senses do wicked and hateful things instead of the good deeds for which
               they were createdâ€”so also the faith which is placed in our nature, by which we
               believe in God and make sure of His spiritual promises, hath reversed the power of
               the will, and instead of God it believeth in devils therewith, and instead of
               spiritual things it maketh sure of corporeal things, and instead of the things which
               are invisible the things here which are visible, and instead of the things which do
               not pass away the things here which shall be dissolved.</p>
            <p>Do thou then, O disciple, make use of faith in its fair order, and turn it not into
               error; and believe by it in God and in His promises, and believe not in the world and
               in its delights therewith. Everything which <pb n="65"/>is seen is temporal, and
               everything which is unseen is eternal, even as <persName>Paul</persName> also taught;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n65-1"/> believe
               then in God, and hope that everlasting blessing will be given to thee by Him, and let
               faith be the beginning of the way of thy instruction. If thou believest not in these
               things which are invisible thou canst not forsake the things which are visible; and
               if thou believest not that the promise of Christ is sure and also in the blessings
               which were promised by Him to all those who should go forth after His Gospel, thou
               wilt not forsake that of which thou hast possession, and wilt not run after the good
               things which He promised to thee. <pb type="external" n="69"/><quote>Unless a man deny his
               father, and his mother, and his brothers, and his sisters, and the whole world, and
               also himself, he cannot be My disciple;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n65-2"/> hear this voice, O disciple, and go
               forth from the world, and this Gospel which promiseth spiritual blessings alone can
               lead thee away from the life and conduct and habits of [this] world. Thou hast heard
               this voice, believe it then, and of it be a disciple and of nothing else, and let
               nothing else be the cause of thy going forth from the world, otherwise thy going
               forth will not prosper. For as is the first cause, so also happeneth it with the rest
               of the matters which follow after it. Now many have, for sundry and divers reasons,
               forsaken the life of the world, and have drawn nigh to the discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName>,
               but not by reason of the one true cause, and in consequence their discipleship hath
               not prospered. And they have become like sick members in the healthy body of the
               discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName>, and they also prevent healthy members from the <pb n="66"
               />performance of the service of the spirit and from the doing of all the commands of
               our <persName>Lord</persName>; it would have been better had they remained in the world and not made an
               exhibition of slackness in the land of spiritual beings. The whole life and conduct
               of the world is sick and infirm in respect of spiritual things, but the body of the
               discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName> is sound and healthy. And whosoever would cut off his own
               members from that sick body, and come to be absorbed in this living body, <pb
                  type="external" n="70"/>it is the love of the Christian life and rule alone which
               can bring him into union with [this] body. And it is not meet that there should be
               [any] other cause for his drawing nigh thereto, as it is in the case of many men, for
               by compulsion, and from obligation, and from the forcing of parents, and by the
               irritation of a woman, and from many other unsound reasons, many men are driven
               perforce to come and be disciples to <persName>Christ</persName>. And when they have come they are only
               [His disciples] in name, while in truth they belong to the world; to the Christian
               life [they belong] falsely and according to the sight of the eye only, and to the
               world in thought and deed; to the Christian life for custom's sake only, and to the
               world for their will's sake; to the Christian life by forcible consent, and to the
               world by the intelligence of their own freewill. And to speak briefly, in the
               Christian life is their shadow, and in the world is their body; in the Christian life
               they exist in form and appearance only, and in the world in [their] true person,
               being made the cause of stumbling to themselves and also to their brethren. And they
               eat the bread of <persName>Christ</persName> by theft, and not by right; and although they are hired by
               Him they labour for another, and <pb n="67"/>are not ashamed. When He calleth them,
               they obey another who is His opponent, and when any man taketh and bringeth them as
               his own property, they abuse His goodness, and despise His commandments. And they are
               made a stumbling-block in the place of the building, and a vision of detriment in the
               region of excellent things, and an occasion of falling in the land of truth, and a
               form of iniquity among helpful appearances. And for those who are thus, it would have
               been better, according to the word of <persName>Christ</persName> <pb type="external" n="71"/>if they
               had never been born,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n67-1"/> or if they were born that they had remained in the
               infirm country of the life of [this] world in which they were, and had not come to
               make others sick with themselves, or to make living limbs die, being themselves dead
               before God. Do thou then, O disciple of God, flee from such things as these, and let
               faith itself alone be the cause of thy going forth from the world, that as thou hast
               laid the foundation, so also the whole building of thy works may ascend. For when thy
               works have received strength from thy faith which is [laid down] first, and which
               hath brought thee forth from the world, all things will be completed and preserved by
               faith in sound condition, and they will abide in integrity, and they will advance
               towards the secret eye of God, and will be completed and perfected by the exhortation
               of faith itself. Now so long as faith looketh upwards it travelleth over the path of
               Christian life and character readily, and it runneth the way of works with swiftness.
               It is that eye of faith which, from the beginning, hath opened itself, and hath seen
               from afar the <pb n="68"/>promises of <persName>Christ</persName>; take heed then that ye blind it not
               by any cause which lighteth upon thee when thou hast begun [to walk] in the path of
               thy journey, lest a stumbling-block come in thy way suddenly, and thou fall down in
               the path along which thou art walking. But as those who begin [to walk] in a material
               path walk along it to the end thereof with the gaze of those who begin, taking care
               that they shut not their eyes in the course of their journey and so obstruct the
               sight which guideth them, so also do thou, O disciple, who hast begun to travel upon
               the heavenly road, keep with thee until the end that sight <pb type="external" n="72"
               />which thou hast had from the beginning. So long as the eye of thy faith regardeth
               the things which are to come, so long will the labours of thy life and conduct be
               light upon thee, and thou wilt delight thyself in the afflictions of thy fair deeds,
               And as the foot is guarded from stumbling-blocks so long as thine eye is open to see,
               so will thy soul be remote and free from slothfulness so long as the sight of faith
               is whole, and it looketh upon and regardeth heavenly things. The soul from which the
               sight of faith is removed is either asleep or dead. That soul which driveth away
               faith from it entirely is dead, and that soul which hath preserved to itself the name
               of faith, but whose eye is not at all times open to look upon spiritual things, is
               asleep, and it is sunk in the sleep of slothfulness. And although it worketh, it
               perceiveth not; and although it is justified, it knoweth not; and although it
               runneth, it is not conscious thereof. And as he that is asleep is not conscious of
               those things which exist by his side, so also the man whose eye of faith is shut
               cannot perceive the good things which are wrought by it; but <pb n="69"/>like as a
               blind man is led by another, so also is he driven by the force of custom, or because
               he is unable to change the forms of the labours upon which he hath laid hold, he
               goeth on in the place in which he is. Now it befitteth not the disciple of <persName>Christ</persName>
               that his virtues should be established by the laws of the children of men, lest when
               the laws are abrogated, or <pb type="external" n="73"/>those who have made them seek
               to change them, his blessings be also dispersed and scattered. He that hath laid down
               the conditions of the strife for us is not a man, and therefore it is not meet for us
               to keep the laws of the children of men in the contest of this strife, but only the
               will of <persName>Christ</persName> Who hath laid down the conditions of the strife.</p>
            <p>This then is the beginning of thy going forth from the world, O thou that wouldst
               begin the journey of the way of heaven! And thou must cast away from thee by faith
