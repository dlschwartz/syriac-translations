            <head type="title">The Eighth Discourse; which teacheth that a man cannot become a perfect disciple of
               <persName>Christ</persName>, unless he first of all make himself destitute of all human possessions, and
               go forth from the world openly with his inner man and with his outer man.</head>
            <p>The man who wisheth to travel along the open way of perfection hath need to make the
               beginning of his journey in the fair order which is becoming to that way, and he
               should not begin his discipleship in the law which seemeth good unto him, but in that
               defined law which was delivered by the word of <persName>Christ</persName> our God unto His disciples,
               even as He walked in this way of perfection. And He in His own Person became a law
               unto us, and He gave us a fair example that we might journey after His footsteps; for
               <persName>Jesus</persName> was not a teacher unto us in words only, but also in the works of perfection
               which He fulfilled in Himself, and therefore <pb type="external" n="223"/>He is truly
               the good Teacher Who taught, and practised, for His teaching was practice, and His
               practice was teaching. And thus also <persName>our Lord</persName> Himself depicted and shewed us in His
               own ministration, for after He had performed all the righteousness which justice
               required, and had kept the law of the commandments which are to be perfected in the
               world. He then left the world, and went forth therefrom that <pb n="215"/>He might
               teach perfection. For I do not say also that those who are in the world cannot be
               justified, but that it is not possible for them to arrive at perfection, for the
               world itself is an obstacle to perfection, that is to say, of righteousness also, and
               of the uprightness which is worked therein. And a man is not able to bear two labours
               and to be perfect in two virtues while he is in the world, and for this reason the
               commandments were defined and set apart for those who journey in the world in order
               that they might possess their lives through them, and the other path of perfection,
               which is above the world, was opened. For the Will of <persName>Christ</persName> ordained the law, that
               is, He required that all the children of men should journey along the path of angels,
               and that no man should turn aside from that mark which He placed in the midst, but
               because not every man was able to do this—now He wished that every man should live—He
               gave divers commandments to every man that he might live thereby. And He made
               measures and steps in His doctrine, not because these things exist in it, but because
               of those who were to receive it, and because they were in need [of them], and without
               them they were not able to live. <pb type="external" n="224"/>To the path of the
               world the life of righteousness is united, and to the path which is outside the world
               is attached perfection, and the end of the path of righteousness and justice is
               absolute destitution of all possessions. For so long as a man possesseth human
               wealth, whether it be little, or whether it be much, he is unable to walk in the path
               of perfection, for in respect of every possession which existed, according to the
               measure thereof doth it become a fetter to the mind, and a chain to the light wings
                  <pb n="216"/>of the understanding so that they cannot fly along the heavenly path.
               Whosoever hath riches must perforce meditate thereupon, and whosoever meditateth upon
               riches cannot meditate upon God, and if on an occasion the remembrance of God rise up
               in him, it is not lasting; for it is not possible that he should remember God when he
               is meditating upon [his] possessions, or if he imagine that he doth remember Him, the
               remembrance is borrowed and is not true, for it is not possible that these two
               remembrances should dwell together at one time in the soul, and if they dwell therein
               one of them must necessarily be borrowed, and the other be true. And if a man think
               truly that he meditateth upon God while he hath in his mind the anxious care of
               riches, [he doeth it] not with all the might of his soul, which it is seemly to us to
               give wholly to God; for we are obliged to serve God not with one of our members, and
               the world with another, and to meditate upon Him at one time, and upon mammon at
               another, but it is right that we should give all our might <pb type="external"
                  n="225"/>to the service of the commandments, and that always the seasons may be
               helpful to us to remember Him, that we may become temples to Him alone, having poured
               out from us every meditation of the mind which is outside Him. And that man is not
               able to serve God worthily while he is in the world, and while he is a possessor of
               riches, and the owner of wealth, the word of <persName>our Redeemer</persName> Himself testifieth, <quote>Ye
               cannot serve God and mammon;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n216-1"/> and forthwith the hearer thought that
               henceforth the door of righteousness was shut in the <pb n="217"/>face of all the
               children of men, for they cannot be wholly free from the care of riches, and
               according to the decision of the word of <persName>Christ</persName>, whosoever careth for it cannot
               care for God. And it is necessary for us to understand the word as it was spoken, for
               according to the rule of those who are perfect, the man who careth for riches cannot
               care for God; but a man, being a possessor of wealth, is able to be justified by that
               other measure of righteousness which is worked in the world, if it be that he is not
               a servant who worshippeth his riches, but a master of the things which he possesseth.
               Some men are slaves of their possessions, and some are masters of their wealth, and
               one man is worshipped by his possessions, and another man worshippeth them. Now the
               word of <persName>our Lord</persName> was spoken concerning the man who is a slave of his possessions,
               and who is not able to be a servant of God; <quote>For ye cannot serve two
               masters.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n217-1"/> Thou seest <pb type="external" n="226"/>that He shewed two masters
               in His discourse, and that in explaining who these were, He said, <quote>Ye cannot serve
               God and mammon.</quote></p>
            <p>Behold then, whosoever hath made mammon his master cannot serve God, but he serveth
               that master whom he hath chosen of his own freewill, his service being especially
               dear unto him, and his dominion over him being beloved by him, because he hath become
               subject unto, him of his own freewill. For the children of men are wont to love
               exceedingly that which they have chosen of their own freewill, and they love it much
               more than Him Who perforce and naturally is Master over them. And behold, if there
               were a few men who have <pb n="218"/>pleased, or who please God, it is because they
               were and are masters of their wealth, and they sent it forth to [do] everything like
               a slave and subject, sometimes to feed the hungry, sometimes to clothe the naked,
               sometimes to redeem the captive, sometimes [to pay] vows and offerings unto God, and
               sometimes to free those who were in the bondage of debts; and wheresoever the will
               desired to rule over it, there it sent it like a servant, even as did <persName>Abraham</persName>, and
               <persName>Isaac</persName>, and <persName>Jacob</persName>, and <persName>Job</persName>, and <persName>Joseph</persName>, and <persName>David</persName>, and <persName>Hezekiah</persName>. And of
               these men some were rich, and some were princes, and some were kings, and
               collectively they all were owners of great possessions and wealth; but they were
               masters of their riches, and their riches were not <pb type="external" n="227"
               />masters of them, their riches worked for them in all the good things which they
               wished [to do], and they did not serve them in all the wickedness which mammon
               demanded.</p>
            <p>Now there are distinctions between the commandments, and it must be understood to
               whom each was spoken. For this commandment, <quote>Ye cannot serve two masters—God and
               mammon,</quote> must, according to the meaning of the passage, have been spoken to those who
               wished to be righteous while they were [still] in the world, and He advised and
               admonished them that because they had ceased from the path of perfection they should
               not become wholly and entirely servants of mammon, and forsake the dominion of God
               which was naturally set over their lives. <quote>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
               earth, where the moth and the rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and
               steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where the moth and the rust do
                  <pb n="219"/>not corrupt, and where thieves break not through nor steal.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n219-1"/>
               And it is evident that this commandment is not applicable to solitaries and to those
               who are perfect, for how could <quote>Lay not up for thyself treasure upon earth</quote> be said
               to him to whom it was commanded, <quote>Take no thought for the morrow?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n219-2"/> And how
               could the words, <quote>Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven of your alms,</quote> apply to
               the man to whom it was said, <quote>Thou shalt not possess two coats, nor wallet, nor
               cloak, nor money in the wallet.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n219-3"/> And what hath the thief who stealeth, or
               the moth which destroyeth to do with him to whom it is commanded that, save himself,
               he should possess nothing? So therefore the words, <pb type="external" n="228"/><quote>Ye
               cannot serve God and mammon,</quote> are a command to those who have possessions, for
               because <persName>the Teacher</persName> saw that they could not. rise up to the grade of perfection, He
               brought Himself down in His speech to their level, and He ordained for them a law
               which was suitable to the position in which they stood, and said, <quote>Since it is
               impossible for thee to be destitute, thou shalt not become a slave to thy wealth, and
               serve it like one subject thereto, but thou shalt be unto it a master in the
               ministration of all good things. For when it is thy master, whithersoever it wisheth
               it sendeth thee, at one time to plunder, at another to thieve, and at another to bear
               false witness, at another to oppress and to despoil, at another to swear false oaths,
               and sometimes [it sendeth thee] even to commit murder, and also to the participation
               with devils, and it omitteth no one of these wicked <pb n="220"/>things which it will
               command thee to do so long as it is thy lord, and thou art its servant. And as, if
               thou be its master, it sendeth thee [to do] all good things, so also if it be thy
               master it sendeth thee [to do] all wickedness.</quote> For it is the law that a master
               should give the command, and that the servant should be commanded, and so long as a
               man is the master he giveth the command, and so long as he is a servant he is
               commanded. And where there are those who give commands those who are commanded will
               be found, and things will be done according to the will of those who give the
               commands. And <persName>Jesus</persName> the Teacher did not lay a heavy command upon those who had
               possessions when He commanded them to be masters of their riches, but only that <pb
                  type="external" n="229"/>which they themselves should have desired, and because
               they did not know how to obtain it, He taught them in this manner. And it is like a
               man who eagerly desireth to become wise, but who knoweth not how to gather together
               knowledge, and another man is found who becometh his teacher and [sheweth him] how to
               collect it and to obtain possession thereof; or another man who loveth wealth, but
               who knoweth not how it is gathered together; or another man who loveth edifices which
               are richly furnished, but he knoweth not how they are to be built, or how they are to
               be furnished. In this manner the children of men desire to be masters of [their]
               riches, but unconsciously it is found that their wealth hath become their master; and
               <persName>the Teacher</persName>, having pity upon those who had possessions, taught them, [saying], <quote>Be
               ye masters of your riches, according to your desire;</quote> and together with this He
               shewed them in what way they should be masters. The desire <pb n="221"/>[to obtain]
               things is one thing, and the knowledge of [how to obtain] them is another. One man
               desireth, but knoweth not how to obtain that which he desireth; and another knoweth
               how to find and to obtain [things], but he desireth [them] not. Now to those who
               desired to become masters of riches, and who had obtained them and they had turned
               and become their master, <persName>Jesus</persName> taught the knowledge of that thing which they
               desired; these then, <persName>Jesus</persName> commanded to be masters of [their] riches, and not to be
               servants thereof, while those who were perfect He commanded to be not even masters,
                  <pb type="external" n="230"/>and He counselled them not to humble themselves to be
               masters of dumb possessions. Those, however, who had possessions He freed from the
               bondage of senseless stuff, lest while they served it they should become servers of
               idols, concerning which it is written, <quote>They have no breath in their mouth, and
               although they have eyes, and ears, and hands, they see not, and hear not, and work
               not.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n221-1"/> And for this reason <persName>the Apostle Paul</persName> called the love of mammon
               <quote>idolatry,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n221-2"/> for as the heathen worship things which have no feeling, and in
               which there is neither life nor perception, even so do those who love riches worship
               the gold which is silent, and the silver which is dumb, together with all [their]
               possessions which have neither feeling nor knowledge. One man <persName>Jesus</persName> commanded,
               [saying], <quote>Be not a servant of riches,</quote> and to another He ordained the law, <quote>Be not
               even a master of wealth;</quote> to one He said, <quote>It is a disgrace to thy freedom that thou
               shouldst be subject unto gold,</quote> and to the other He said, <quote>It is a contemptible <pb
                  n="222"/>thing for thy mastership to rule over natural things, for thou art
               humbled to the possessions which are the shells of natural things.</quote> For to him who
               had forsaken mastership over everything, and had been caught fast by the desire of
               little wealth, He said, <quote>Possess, only when thou hast become possessor of thy
               possession, let it not happen that thy possession possess thee;</quote> but the other whom
               He saw had been exalted from being a servant to wealth, He raised up to a higher
               grade than this, and said, <quote>Be not a master unto it.</quote> For as <pb type="external"
                  n="231"/>it is a disgrace to him that wisheth to be master of his possessions to
               become a servant thereto, even so is it a disgrace also to him that hath been freed
               from the bondage of wealth, that there should be found with him the mastership of
               wealth.</p>
            <p>The poor man possesseth the things of poverty, and the rich man the great and
               glorious things of wealth; now therefore since those which have possessions are poor,
               they possess poverty, [which is] riches and temporal possessions, but the destitute
               are rich, and it would be a disgrace to that excellent name if it became the
               possessor of the things of poverty, gold, and silver, and raiment, and if it
               exchanged the riches of eternity for the poverty of time, and heavenly possessions
               for human mammon. And that thou mightest not serve mammon <persName>our Lord</persName> said unto him
               that loved mammon, <quote>Be thou its master, and let it be to thee a slave.</quote> It appeareth
               therefore that <persName>Jesus</persName> gave this commandment to those who were rich, but to all the
               others who wished to walk in the lofty path of perfection He said, <quote>Possess not gold,
               nor silver, nor money in your wallets, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor <pb n="223"
               />staff, for the labourer is worthy of his food,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n223-1"/> that is to say, <quote>Such
               freedom befitteth such labour.</quote> So then <persName>Jesus</persName> sent them from all the world, and
               then <pb type="external" n="232"/>He brought them out of the world, saying, <quote>Go
               forth, and leave everything in its place in the world, and take not out with you to
               the country of life things which are mortal. Ye have been called to put on purple,
               cast off first the filthy rags of the world, and then put on royal purple. For who
               that wisheth to put on the glory which is for eternity would not first cast off the
               garments which are worn out, and then put on that glory which never becometh old? And
               whosoever wisheth to be enrolled in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> above will not have a dwelling in the
               earth, but he will dwell in that city. Whosoever wisheth not to be received in that
               world by Grace shall be received in this world graciously by every man; and whosoever
               wisheth to be a dweller in the marriage chamber, let him not possess in this world
               either a wallet or a cloak; and whosoever seeketh to obtain God, let him not possess
               money in his wallet; for it is an endless disgrace that together with God a man
               should be possessed of money. For he who possesseth the things of time, together with
               those of eternity, is not sensible of the greatness of his possession, and therefore
               he runneth to obtain poverty together with riches. And neither is it possible that
               these two treasures can be contained in one vessel, for no man ever put scourings
               together with gold in one vessel, nor did any one ever account straw and wood of
               equal value with precious stones.</quote> This commandment then was given by <persName>the Master</persName> to
                  <pb n="224"/>His disciples when He sent them to be fishers of men unto life; <pb
                  type="external" n="233"/>He cut off first from them all the fetters of the world,
               and He loosed from them all human ties, and then He sent them to loose others, for
               the man that is fettered cannot loose him that is in bondage. The possession of the
               things of the world is a fetter to all the members, and a curb of all the senses, and
               the whole man is bound and fettered in his inward and outward things thereby. And
               well did <persName>our Lord</persName> first loose the fetters of the world from His disciples, and then
               send them to loose the bonds of others, that those who were in bonds might see that
               those whose bonds were loosed bore the mark of freedom, and the sign of the Kingdom,
               and that He that loosed them might be believed in by them, especially when they saw
               that those from whom they had cut off the bonds of the world were free.</p>
            <p>This similitude then did <persName>our Lord</persName> set in the place of these commandments which He
               delivered to the Apostles when He commanded them to possess nothing; He made them
               destitute of everything, and then He sent them to be ministers of His will in the
               conversion of others, so that therefrom we might learn, that everyone who wisheth to
               be a minister unto God must deny himself all worldly possessions, and must be
               destitute of everything after the manner of the Apostles, and then he shall go forth
               and become a minister of the perfect will of God. For as long as the Apostles were
               with <persName>Jesus</persName>, and were going about with Him from place to place, they stood not in
               the position of perfection, <pb type="external" n="234"/>and for this reason our Lord
               was silent about the [other] commandments, so long as they were Apostles with Him;
               and He allowed them to do the <pb n="225"/>other things which followed closely upon
               their continuance with Him, and which were useful also to those who drew nigh to Him,
               either going about among the multitudes who were sitting down in the wilderness, or
               when they were sent by Him [to do] things which were of use for some visible purpose,
               even as when He sent <persName>Simon</persName> to the sea to catch a fish and to pay the poll
               tax,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n225-1"/> and as when they were also invited with Him in the body to the feast
               chamber.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n225-2"/> And they wandered from city to city and went round about with Him,
               and they paid Him honour visibly before the crowds, and they kept back from Him the
               press of the multitudes that not every man might forcibly make his way to Him, even
               as it is written, <quote>And certain people sought to bring little children to Him that He
               might bless them, and His disciples restrained them;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n225-3"/> and everywhere,
               according to the measure of their knowledge at that time they paid Him honour like
               unto this. And He humbled Himself and accepted these things from them from time to
               time, because He knew that they were only able to offer unto Him visible
               ministration. And although their ministration was feeble, still it was according to
               the measure of their knowledge; for He considered the willingness, and likewise
               accepted the ministration thereof. And it is the wont of <persName>Jesus</persName>, whether it be then
               or now, to demand service according to the power of the will, and He desireth not
               that the work should be above <pb type="external" n="235"/>the will of him that doeth
               it, for if it be apparent that he doeth for Him a work which is above his
               intelligence, or above the law, <pb n="226"/>either perfunctorily or slothfully, this
               <persName>Jesus</persName> wisheth not, nor to receive service from a rational man as if he were a dumb
               vessel. For while He was humbling Himself to receive from all the measures of their
               intelligence, and the services which they offered to Him, He magnified them in His
               teaching, that they might be exalted to the ministration of those who are perfect
               from their former state, so that the first service might be a path for that which
               followed after it, and that the first virtue might become training and exercise for
               the other virtue which should be perfected therefrom. And together with the work <persName>the
               Teacher</persName> set forth doctrine, not only in deed but also by His word, even as He did to
               <persName>Mary</persName> and <persName>Martha</persName>, who both offered service unto Him, but the service of <persName>Mary</persName> was
               more perfect than that of <persName>Martha</persName>, and both ministered unto Him, the one only
               according to the body, and the other according to the spirit, and our Lord received
               both services, and pronounced blessed the service which was superior to its fellow,
               [saying], <quote><persName>Mary</persName> hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from
               her.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n226-1"/> As if a man should say, <quote>Do thou also, O <persName>Martha</persName>, forsake that
               [service] which is imperfect, and be exalted in thy service to the more excellent
               grade.</quote> And Jesus did not reject the ministration of <persName>Martha</persName>, for according to the
               measure of her knowledge and of her love was <pb type="external" n="236"/>the measure
               of her ministration; but He wished that she would offer great instead of little
               things, and instead of the service of the body the service of the spirit. And the
               service of <persName>Mary</persName> and of <persName>Martha</persName> was like exactly unto the service of <pb n="227"
               />the holy Apostles of the old and of the latter times, for that bodily service which
               they also offered unto Him in one place after another was like unto that of <persName>Martha</persName>;
               but that other service which He taught them to offer unto Him in the commandment, <quote>Ye
               shall possess nothing,</quote> was the counterpart of the service of the blessed <persName>Mary</persName>. For
               there are many who, like <persName>Martha</persName> and <persName>Zacchaeus</persName>, and those women who clave to Him,
               and who ministered unto Him from their possessions, are justified, and there are some
               whose service like that of <persName>Mary</persName> and the Apostles is wholly of the spirit; and
               <persName>Jesus</persName> wished and desired this service, so that all the children of men might arrive
               at perfection. And His coming into the world took place that He might deliver to the
               children of men the life and rule of spiritual beings, even as also <persName>the holy
               Apostle</persName> taught that it was meet that the man of God should be in all perfection,
               [saying], <quote>The man of God shall be perfect [to do] every good and perfect
               thing.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n227-1"/></p>
            <p>Now this perfection <persName>Jesus</persName> delivered unto His disciples by those commandments
               concerning absolute poverty which He gave to them, when He denied to them the whole
               world, and everything that is therein, and not them only, but also, in them and with
               them, every man <pb type="external" n="237"/>who followeth after perfection. For when
               He ordained the law for the persons of the Apostles, He delivered doctrine unto the
               multitude, and unto the whole race of the children of men, and He urged every one who
               wished to be obedient unto Him to [follow] this fair thing. And moreover, at the
               beginning of their election when He called them to go <pb n="228"/>after Him, it is
               written of them that, <quote>Immediately He called them they forsook everything and went
               after Him.</quote> They were casting nets into the sea and He saw and called them, <quote>and they
               left their nets and their ship, and went after Him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n228-1"/> And He saw also <persName>James</persName>
               and <persName>John</persName> in a ship with <persName>Zebedee</persName> their father, and He called them also, and
               straightway they left the net with <persName>Zebedee</persName> their father, and went after Him.</p>
            <p>Behold the law of the going forth after God! And behold the straight rule which hath
               been marked for us in the Holy Books! Therefore it is right that every man who
               desireth to go forth after God should emulate the going forth of the Apostles, and
               that he should despise and reject everything which is visible, and deny the whole
               world, for <persName>Christ</persName> hath said that the man who desireth to be a perfect disciple of
               Him must also deny himself.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n228-2"/> If a man denieth his life according to the word
               of <persName>our Redeemer</persName>, then will he be a disciple, but without this there is no means of
               a man arriving at perfection. <pb type="external" n="238"/>And how can a man who
               denieth not himself the possessions of the world, and who despiseth not all the
               riches which are seen, and bodily pleasures, arrive at that perfection which <persName>Jesus</persName>
               delivered? And I do not speak these things of myself, but I follow after the desire
               of the Holy Books, and I take my stand upon the law which hath been ordained by the
               King.</p>
            <p>The disciples are the beginning of the discipleship of Christians, and their calling
               was such—as it is written concerning them—that immediately they were called <pb
                  n="229"/>they forsook everything, and went forth after Him. And whosoever wisheth
               to become a disciple let him consider this example, and let him look at this mark
               with all his mind and understanding, in order that inwardly and outwardly he may make
               himself destitute of everything, and then let him begin to journey along this
               heavenly path; for he will never be filled unless he first of all empty himself, and
               he will never lay his hand upon the riches of heaven unless he first let go the
               poverty which he holdeth. It is impossible for him to lay hold upon the one, unless
               he let go the other, especially as they are opposed to each other, and each of them
               when it draweth nigh destroyeth the other. And behold when we have made ourselves
               destitute of everything, if we have only emptied ourselves to the extent of keeping
               His commandments, our ministration is not yet worthy of God, inasmuch as the strength
               of our soul is divided and split asunder, and some thereof is occupied with the love
               of the things of the world, and it is not able to offer unto God the service <pb
                  type="external" n="239"/>of love. For this command is grievous unto whomsoever is
               fettered with the love of riches, and although it be freedom from the world, yet to
               those who are held fast in the subjection of the world—those who are fettered, and
               whose fetters are pleasant unto them; and those who are fast bound, and their bonds
               are sweet unto them; those who have thrown the chains of anxious care upon all their
               members, and have taken upon them to become subject unto the world, and not servants
               of Christ—it is hard and difficult. For Jesus proclaimeth freedom unto thee, but the
               world hath prepared slavery for thee, and if the bondage of the world is sweet to
               thee, it is not <pb n="230"/>because its nature is to be so, but because thy own
               desire hath been corrupted, and it hath lusted evilly. When a man longeth for
               something belonging to the world, his desire is not healthy, but he desireth, like a
               sick man, that which will not benefit him, and [his] desire is altogether to his own
               injury; for it is the custom with many sick persons to desire [things] for their own
               injury rather than for their good, and [to choose] that which will prevent their
               recovery rather than that which will heal their sickness. For the healing which is in
               them is turned to illness, and the power of the natural appetite which is in them is
               also changed from its natural condition, for the strength of the appetite is
               preserved by the uniformity of admixture and by the healthy condition of the body,
               and when the admixture of the body is disturbed the bodily appetites are also
               confounded. <pb type="external" n="240"/>The man who is being consumed with fever
               desireth a draught of cold water, and although it would do him harm to drink he
               asketh to drink, and is furious with those who will not give him [water]; but the
               wise physician answereth him not, because he knoweth that it is the blind craving
               that is in him which asketh for that which would prevent his recovery. Similarly the
               riches of the world are sweet, and the possessions thereof are much desired by those
               who are diseased in their souls, and who are lacking the healing of divine knowledge,
               and they ask for everything which will do them harm; but our heavenly Physician by
               His health-giving provisions warneth us against harm, and He commandeth us to do, not
               that which is sweet to us and in which we find satisfaction, but that which will be
               of benefit to us, even though we may not find satisfaction in the doing thereof, for
               the wise physician <pb n="231"/>followeth not the desire of the sick, and he doth not
               submit himself to their appetites which will retard and injure their recovery, but he
               treateth them according to the beneficial law of healing, and teacheth them to fight
               against their desire that they may be healed.</p>
            <p>Let us then receive the yoke of poverty according as <persName>our Redeemer</persName> commanded, even
               though it be heavy upon us, for it will not be heavy to the will which agreeth with
               the commandments of <persName>Christ</persName>. For there is no man who doth not desire to be a free
               man, and to be free from the yoke of bondage, and moreover, unto every man the name
               of <quote>free</quote> is more beloved than that of <quote>slave.</quote> And <persName>our Lord</persName>, in that He commanded
               us to be aliens to the world, <pb type="external" n="241"/>gave us true freedom, in
               which He Himself lived and moved while He was in the world, for although by nature
               inasmuch as He was God, He was free, yet in that He took the form of a slave He lived
               and moved in freedom, and He was above all the care of [this] world. For it is
               written that <persName>Jesus</persName> <quote>took the form of a servant, and He became the likeness of the
               children of men, and He was found to be in form like unto a man,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n231-1"/> and He was
               truly as we are. But in one thing, which is outside of us, He did not participate,
               that is to say, He did not possess on [this] earth riches, and possessions, or
               mammon, or wealth, or buildings, or estates, or vineyards, for <persName>Jesus</persName> possessed none
               of these things in order that He might teach His own [disciples] that they should not
               possess them; and that Being Who was free took no care for them, that He might free
               us also from care for them. And He was not bowed <pb n="232"/>beneath the yoke of
               bondage to the world, that He might also take from off us the heavy yoke of the
               bondage of the world; and He was not fettered by human affairs that He might loose
               from off us the fetters thereof; and carking care did not chain Him, that He might
               raise His disciples above the care and anxiety concerning all the things which are
               visible. The free Man dwelt in creation in freedom in order that He might teach us in
               very deed also to live therein in freedom. Whosoever then wisheth to become a
               disciple to that Master let him regard the sojourn of His Master in the world, and as
               He was, even so let him himself be in creation. The Lord of the world was a stranger
               and an alien in the world, and as was the Lord, even so it is meet <pb
                  type="external" n="242"/>that the servants should be. And observe how destitute of
               human things was He in Whom all fulness was gathered together, for in all creation He
               had neither a nest nor a den which have even the beast and bird! <quote>The foxes have
               holes, and the bird of heaven hath a covert, but the <persName>Son of Man</persName> hath not even where
               to lay His head.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n232-1"/></p>
            <p>Behold, O disciple, thy course of life and action are marked out by the words of thy
               Master: that which He had not, thou shalt not have, and that which He possessed not,
               thou shalt not possess. Disciples are not known by [their] outward appearance, but by
               the similarity and agreement of works, and by their treading in the footsteps of
               their Master, and by their walking in the way which He trod for them; for if the path
               had not been trodden, and if the footsteps of our God were not visible therein, there
               would then have <pb n="233"/>been an excuse for the slothful, those to whom the bonds
               of the world are dear, but behold the path is open, and the way is known, and the
               tracks therein can be seen by every man with the light of truth. But if a man seeth
               them not, although he setteth his footsteps upon them, it is manifest that it must be
               because he lacketh the light of faith which sheweth [them], and although he thinketh
               that he is journeying along the way, he is travelling away from it into error. And
               the words which <persName>Jesus</persName> spake to thee, [when He said] that He had not a place wherein
               to lay His head, were to teach thee that thou also shouldst not have a place wherein
               to lay thy head, for He said, <quote>The foxes have holes, and the bird of heaven hath a
               covert;</quote> therefore if thou possessest a house thou art like unto these, <pb
                  type="external" n="243"/>and if thou hast a dwelling-place in the world, thou art
               to be compared with the beasts and birds, for this is what the literal interpretation
               of the words teacheth. But if thou art destitute of everything which is in the world,
               and thou hast not upon earth a place wherein to rest thy head, thou art like unto
               God, for that which <persName>the Master</persName> wished the disciples to be, He depicted and showed
               to them in His own Person, and He confirmed His doctrine unto us by His deeds, even
               as it is written concerning Him, <quote>From [the time of] His baptism by <persName>John</persName> He began
               to work and to teach,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n233-1"/> even until that day in which He was taken up [into
               heaven]. These were the fair deeds and the excellent manner of life which He shewed
               forth in His own Person. And although the raising of the dead, and the cleansing of
               the lepers, and the opening of the <pb n="234"/>eyes of the blind, and the making the
               lame to walk, and the straightening of the crooked limbed, and the making upright of
               those bent double, and the driving away of devils, and the walking upon the waves,
               and the stilling of the winds, were also works, because they were signs and wonders,
               yet the writer calleth the spiritual life and conduct which appeared in the Person of
               <persName>Christ</persName>, the work which was closely united to teaching. For if He came only for the
               sake of [doing] good deeds, and not to work wonders, His teaching also was for
               spiritual life and conduct, and to this He also united work, in order that He might
               show us in Himself the type of all perfection. And He forsook the world and all the
               conversation among the children of men immediately after the baptism of <persName>John</persName>, <pb
                  type="external" n="244"/>and went forth to the wilderness, for until [the time of]
               His baptism He was fulfilling another rule of life, and He kept everything of the old
               law, that He might pay that debt on account of which all our race had become subject
               unto the bondage of sin, and of the law, and of death. And <persName>Jesus</persName> in His own Person
               kept everything which it was meet for those who lived righteously in the world to do,
               for it is written concerning Him<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n234-1"/> that He went up into the Temple, and
               offered up offerings, and that He was subject unto the priests, and that He fulfilled
               everything which was written in the law. And this [He did] for two reasons: firstly,
               that He might pay that which was due, and secondly that He might teach everyone in
               the world that the righteousness of the law should be a care to <pb n="235"/>him, and
               that he should minister to the service of God by the observance of the law. And He
               omitted not to keep the smallest jot or tittle of the law, in order that He might
               teach him that was still in the world to keep everything which he was commanded like
               one subject thereunto, for everyone who still leadeth the life of the world, and who
               is still fettered by the taking and giving of the cares of the children of men is
               still under the law; but whosoever hath made himself poor and goeth forth from the
               world is above the world, and he is of necessity also above the law, because the law
               hath not power to bring into subjection those who are above the law. For whosoever
               standeth in the country of bondage is perforce governed by the law, but whosoever
               standeth in the country <pb type="external" n="245"/>of freedom, his whole life is
               like that of a free man, and of his own freewill, like a freeman, he doeth good deeds
               with power, and not like one who is bowed under the yoke of the law. And to speak
               briefly, wherever wickedness is wrought there also hath the law power to turn it back
               and to restrain it, according to the testimony of the teacher <persName>Paul</persName>, who saith, <quote>The
               law was not laid down for the righteous, but for the wicked and unruly, and for the
               unclean, and for those who smite their fathers and mothers, and for murderers, and
               adulterers, and whoremongers;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n235-1"/> over such as these hath the law power. Now
               therefore, although our discourse was wishing to shew that the perfect who are led by
               the spirit are alone above the law, it is found that <persName>Paul</persName> teacheth that the
               righteous also, who are on a lower level than the perfect, are free from the law, for
               they do not do the <pb n="236"/>good things of the law as if they were fearers
               thereof, but as those who are at peace with the law. For the man who killeth not,
               that he may die not, since murder is ready in his mind, is a murderer; and he who
               committeth not adultery, although he wisheth to do so, through fear of being
               condemned by the judge, and delivered over to the law, is an adulterer; and every one
               who deviseth harm, but who by reason of the fear of the punishments which are
               commanded by the law is held back, and doeth it not, is nevertheless, according to
               his own will, the worker of all wickedness. Now as for the righteous who are kept
               back from doing wickedness, it is not because they are afraid lest wickedness should
               happen through them, but because they may not provoke God to anger by a deed which is
               unpleasing to Him. <pb type="external" n="246"/>Therefore there are some who are held
               back from wickedness, because they are afraid of wickedness itself, and there are
               some who are held back therefrom because they would [rather] do the things which are
               good, for unless a man bringeth wickedness to nought, he is not able to do good
               things.</p>
            <p>Up to [the time of] baptism <persName>our Lord</persName> delivered the rule and life of righteousness
               to the children of men that they might do the good things which are written in the
               law, and offer up offerings of their possessions to God, and vow vows and pay [them],
               and be constant in the Temple of God, and receive blessings in faith from the
               priests, that children might be subject unto parents and minister unto them, that
               they might also seek the word of life, and ask and learn from the teachers everything
               which is necessary for instruction in virtues, and that they might hear and be
               subject unto the prophets; these <pb n="237"/>then, and things like unto them, and
               all the righteousness which befitteth believing men, did our Lord deliver in the life
               and conduct of His Gospel, from the beginning up to the time of of [His] baptism, to
               those who had possessions, that they might gather together their possessions while
               they were in the world, and He Himself did everything that He might teach us to do
               likewise. He was purified according to the command of the law, that He might teach
               the faithful to be purified from iniquity; He was circumcised that they also might
               circumcise and cast away from them the foreskin of the heart, and that they might cut
               off from themselves the ministration unto every lust; He went up to the Temple laden
               with offerings that He might tread for them the path in which they should run to the
               house of God bearing their vows and offerings, <pb type="external" n="247"/>He drew
               nigh to the priest that he might bless Him and pray over Him, and although He was the
               Priest of the Spirit, he spake with Him other great things, that He might shew the
               faithful also to ask for the prayer of the priests, and to bow the heads of
               themselves and of their children to their blessing. He went up each year to <placeName>the
               Temple</placeName>, as it is written of Him,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n237-1"/> that He might teach the faithful to go to
               the Temple of God always. He made feasts according to their proper times and
               ceremonies that He might stir thee up to keep the festivals of the Church with
               discretion, and that thou mightest fulfil in them all thy obligations. He sat among
               the teachers, and listened unto them, and asked them questions,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n237-2"/> and He bowed
               His ear, and received instruction, <pb n="238"/>that thou also mightest hear and ask
               questions, and incline thine ear continually to the hearing of the divine
               commandments, and that thou mightest ask questions and learn those things which are
               beneficial to thy life, even from those who are inferior to thee in knowledge, even
               as <persName>our Lord</persName> Himself asked questions of those who were inferior to Him in knowledge,
               and He received doctrine from those who had gathered together doctrine from the law
               which He Himself had given. And moreover, finally, when He saw all the sinners who
               were running to the baptism of <persName>John</persName>, the prophet of God, He also went with them,
               and He bowed His head under the hand of the Herald, and He received baptism from him
               as one who was in need thereof—from him who needed to be baptized of Him; and He
               forsook the habitation of man, and went forth to the wilderness to <persName>John</persName> with all
               the multitudes.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n238-1"/> <pb type="external" n="248"/>And why [did He do] these
               things unless it were to teach those who were masters of wealth, and those who dwelt
               in the world, to go forth to the saints, and to run to the solitary dwellers, and to
               honour the prophets and righteous men, and to be obedient to the admonition of their
               words by the discretion of their faith?</p>
            <p>Now therefore this righteousness did our <persName>Redeemer</persName> deliver, and this rule and
               conduct did He shew to the faithful in the time which preceded [His] baptism, and He
               admonished those who had possessions to possess these virtues, for He did not give
               this rule and conduct of life to the solitary dwellers, neither did He deliver it to
               those who were perfect. What temple <pb n="239"/>hath the spiritual man to go to,
               seeing that he himself is the temple of God? And what dwelling hath he from which to
               go to the house of God, seeing that He hath not even a shelter in the world wherein
               to dwell? And with what shall he offer offerings and pay vows, seeing that in [all]
               creation he possesseth nothing? And with what shall he clothe the naked and receive
               strangers, seeing that he himself is both a stranger and naked? And what wickedness
               can the man who is perfect, and complete in all virtues, cut off and cast from him?
               And of whom shall the man who hath no conversation with the children of men ask, and
               from whom shall he learn? if he hath need to learn, the Spirit of God instead of a
               man will teach him.</p>
            <p>Now therefore this doctrine until [the time of His] baptism was delivered unto
               righteous believers, <pb type="external" n="249"/>and it was given unto righteous
               owners of possessions, and to those who had not entirely gone forth from the world,
               in order that those who were suitable for the condition in which they lived might not
               be deprived of good works. And <persName>Christ</persName> Himself Who is everything, in Whom is
               everything, in Whose hand is everything, and because of Whom everything is,
               manifested this rule and conduct of life in His own Person, and although it fell
               short of perfection, yet He nevertheless fulfilled it, in order that He might give
               unto every man his measure of instruction, and that according to his grade and
               position he might draw nigh to a fair life, for without virtues it is not possible
               for a man to live. Now these virtues are different from one another, and moreover the
               commandments which are given concerning them, are like the virtues, different each
               from each. For behold, it is written that before His <pb n="240"/>baptism He was
               subject unto His parents; <quote>He went back with them to <placeName>Nazareth</placeName>, and was subject unto
               them.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n240-1"/> But observe that, after the baptism, when He was delivering a rule of
               life which was more perfect than this to the children of men, He was not persuaded to
               acknowledge parents after the body. <quote>Who is My mother, and who are My
               brethren?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n240-2"/> He said to him that spake of them to Him. And although He was
               obedient and subject unto His parents before baptism, in the time which followed,
               when He was delivering the rule and course of life of spiritual beings, He said, <quote>I
               know them not;</quote> and they called Him to go forth to them, but He would not be
               persuaded. <pb type="external" n="250"/>And His mother spake to Him, and He listened
               not unto her then because He was perfecting the will of the Father Who sent Him, and
               was not fulfilling the humble commandments. Now if <persName>our Lord</persName> had done this before
               baptism when He was keeping the law, that is, if He had been called by His mother,
               and He had not obeyed, He would have transgressed the law; but in this case, He did
               not [transgress] except to shew that He was more obedient to the Father of nature
               than to the parents of grace, and that He might also teach those who are perfect to
               be more obedient unto the Father of grace than unto natural parents. <quote>I do not seek
               My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. And I did not come down from heaven to
               do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me</quote>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n240-3"/> These things were spoken
               when He was fulfilling within Himself perfection, in order that spiritual beings who
               are outside the world might understand that not only to natural <pb n="241"/>parents
               should they not be obedient and keep in subjection unto them, but also that they
               should not be persuaded by their own will, neither by their own wants and pleasures
               in any thing, but that they should deny themselves, even as it was said by <persName>the
               Redeemer</persName>, <quote>Whosoever denieth not himself cannot be My disciple.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n241-1"/> Now
               therefore it is written that three days after <persName>our Lord</persName> had returned from the
               wilderness, He was bidden to a feast, He, and His mother, and His brethren, and His
               disciples.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n241-2"/> <pb type="external" n="251"/>And when wine was lacking for the
               guests, His mother said to <persName>Jesus</persName>, <quote>They have no wine,</quote> and she began on this
               occasion also to speak to Him with authority, even as a mother doth from early habit;
               but <persName>Jesus</persName> restrained that freedom of speech, teaching that the obligation of
               parental reverence had been paid by Him, and that henceforth He would not be subject
               unto His parents as He had been of yore. And observe what a severe rebuke He brought
               against that early authority thereby! <quote>What have I to do with thee, woman?</quote> The words
               are full of rebuke, and the whole speech is full of indignation, and rightly so,
               because by this speech He was giving an example to those who are perfect of not being
               governed by the law of natural parents when they have come out from the world in
               which [their] parents still live. For <persName>Mary</persName> stood in one rule of life, and <persName>Jesus</persName>
               stood in another, that is to say, she lived the life of the law, and He lived the
               life of the Spirit; and it was not well that He Who lived the life of the Spirit
               should be commanded by one who was still governed by the law. <pb n="242"/><persName>Mary</persName>
               gave the command like a woman in authority, and <persName>Jesus</persName> answered her like a free man;
               <quote>They have no wine,</quote> said <persName>Mary</persName>, and these are words of authority, and like a mother
               she spake with a command. <quote>What have I to do with thee, O woman?</quote> He replied like one
               who was not subject [unto her], and He spake as unto a strange woman who was not His
               mother. For He did not say, <quote>What hast thou to do with me, My mother?</quote>, but, <quote>What
               hast thou to do with Me, O woman? By grace thou hast become my mother, <pb
                  type="external" n="252"/>and through Divine dispensation I have been born of thee;
               and I have been subject unto thee, and I have been obedient, but not because I am
               bound [to be so] to thee naturally. My beginning was not from thee, that I should
               receive grace from thee, for it was for thy sake that I came into being. Thou didst
               not become with child with suffering, neither didst thou bring me forth with the
               pangs of birth; thou didst not rear Me as one who was in need of rearing that I
               should give unto thee the reward of the fulfilling of My wants. Everything which thou
               didst give to Me I have given to thee. And if thou didst carry Me in thy womb, and
               didst grow great with Me, and didst bring Me forth, and didst care for Me, and didst
               bring Me up, these things took place by the power which came from Me. And that I have
               been obedient and subject unto thee was not a debt which I was bound to pay thee on
               My own behalf, but I paid the debt and I fulfilled the law on behalf of all the
               children who rebel against [their] parents. And now that the debt hath been paid, and
               dispensation of the law hath been fulfilled, what have I to do with thee, O woman?</quote>
               Now this speech is like unto the words, <quote>Who is My mother?</quote> and unto that <pb n="243"
               />which He said to <persName>John</persName>, <quote>Behold thy mother!</quote> and again He said to <persName>Mary</persName>, <quote>Behold
               thy son!</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n243-1"/> And it is moreover like unto another speech which <persName>Jesus</persName> spake
               unto them when they sought to take Him with them to the feast as they were going up
               to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, to that feast, according to [His] former wont before baptism, when He
               separated Himself from them, [saying], <quote>Go ye up to the feast, but I will not go up
               to the feast,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n243-2"/> and after <pb type="external" n="253"/>He had dismissed them,
               and had not gone up with them, He turned back, and went up in the midst of the feast.
               And His going up is not contrary to that which He said, <quote>I will not go up,</quote> for He
               said, <quote>I will not go up as one who is subject [unto the law],</quote> because they were
               going up as men who were subject to the law, that they might do the works of the law;
               but <persName>Jesus</persName> went up as one having authority, to gather together unto Him those who
               were bidden to the new feast. And in that He said, <quote>I will not go up,</quote> He shewed two
               things; that He was subject neither unto parents, nor unto the law. For he that is
               subject unto parents doeth whatsoever they command him, and he also who is under the
               law must, together with the commandments, observe all its works. He was from the
               beginning of the feast bound to go up, because at this feast all the Jews also were
               going up to the Temple, and, moreover, they went up thither a few days before [the
               feast], to purify themselves, that when they came to the first day of the feast they
               might be pure. But <persName>Jesus</persName> did none of these things, for He went not up with them in
               order that He might shew them that He was not subject unto them, and He did not [go
               up] <pb n="244"/>at the beginning of the feast that He might teach them that He did
               not go up to keep the feast; but He went up in the middle thereof, going up of His
               own freewill. And His going up after He had told His parents that He was not going up
               was like unto that which He did at the feast of <placeName>Cana</placeName>, for after He had said to
               <persName>Mary</persName>, <quote>What hast thou to do with me, O woman</quote>—a speech which seemed to indicate
               that He would not be obedient unto what she had said—He turned and did <pb
                  type="external" n="254"/>that thing which she had said, not because she had
               commanded Him, but because of His power, and because the time had come for Him to
               begin to work miracles, that thereby it might be seen Who He was, and that He might
               make His glory known and gather together unto Him disciples, and also that He might
               shew that henceforth He would do everything with authority like One that was free,
               and not according to the feebleness of human nature, and not according to the
               subjection of parents, and not according to the law's command.</p>
            <p>Now we have shewn the power of these things which we have spoken from the Holy Book,
               and it is right, moreover, for him that readeth, that while he readeth our discourse,
               he should examine the Holy Book, and see that these matters are, in their several
               places, known to be thus; and in order that this meaning should be marked out for us
               the passages are distinct, each from the other, and one course of life and action is
               different from the other. This mystery, then, <persName>Jesus</persName> delivered unto us by the life
               which He led until [His] baptism, and from [His] baptism to the cross, because all
               righteousness is defined by these two courses: a man should work either in himself,
               or he should work with that which <pb n="245"/>belongeth to him; the service which is
               of himself is the righteousness which is outside him, and the service which is in him
               is his own perfection. For the righteousness of the law is one thing, and the
               righteousness which <persName>Christ</persName> gave was another; the righteousness of the law [lasted]
               until [His] baptism, but that which was of Him was from baptism unto the Cross, and
               thenceforward it is the delight and life which is above the world. Therefore at the
               end of [His] baptism <persName>Jesus</persName> had attained <pb type="external" n="255"/>unto the limit
               of the righteousness of the law, but from that time until the Cross He stood at the
               limit of the spiritual perfection in the perfect goodness which He Himself had
               brought unto creation. Henceforth then it is meet for us to understand that all the
               children of men who, being still in the world, work good things, are even as the
               righteous men of old, that is to say, like <persName>Abraham</persName>, and <persName>Isaac</persName>, and <persName>Jacob</persName>, and
               all the other just men and Prophets of old. And the righteousness of the law may be
               thus described: a man should labour while he is in the world, whether to clothe the
               naked, or relieve the afflicted, or receive strangers into his house, or visit the
               sick, or hasten to the help of the saints, and solitary dwellers, and monks, or
               whether he set apart for himself seasons of prayer, or whether he be constant in the
               temple of God, or whether he lend money without diminution of the amount and without
               exacting interest, or whether he covet not that which is his neighbour's, or whether
               he be subject unto his parents, or whether he be obedient unto, and honoureth the
               priests and teachers, or whether he do good deeds unto every man, that is to say, if
               as he would that men should do unto him, so he doeth unto them. </p>
            <pb n="246"/>
            <p>This is the righteousness which the old law taught, and <persName>Jesus</persName> fulfilled it until
               [His] baptism, and all believing men, who have not yet made themselves destitute of
               their riches, are bound to perform [it]; <pb type="external" n="256"/>but the
               spiritual rule and conduct of life, and perfection, <persName>Jesus</persName> delivered unto us from
               [His] baptism unto the cross. May we all, through His grace, be accounted worthy by
               Him, to Whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>
