            <head type="title">The Sixth Discourse: which maketh known therein that, after that faith which is born
               of the simplicity of nature, the fear of God is stirred up in man, and how it is
               produced, and by what things faith is established and confirmed within us.</head>
            <p>Let us now with a mind fearing God again draw nigh to the doctrine of the word of the
               fear of God, and according to our power, and as we are able, that is to say,
               according as the grace of God shall grant, let us make use of [our] speech for our
               own help, and for the advantage of others. For we do not write in order that we may
               appear to be learned, but because we love to speak of our own benefits for [the good
               of] others. And we do not remain silent and speak not because many [others] have
               spoken and written, for those who were before us have written and spoken like
               teachers; but we, like their disciples, repeat after them their doctrine, even as a
               child who giveth utterance to and repeateth at all times the doctrine which he
               receiveth from his master that he may not forget it; and thus also do we repeat the
               things which have been heard by us, so that by repetition we may remember them, and
               so that our thoughts may be kept from wandering after empty things which benefit not. </p>
            <pb n="154"/>
            <p>For as long as the mind is not held fast <pb type="external" n="160"/>by beneficial
               thoughts it wandereth outside itself, and goeth hither and thither in a place which
               is outside the help of God. And as when it meditateth upon virtues it dwelleth in the
               light of the remembrance of God, so also when it constructeth and meditateth upon
               useless and empty thoughts, its whole conversation is in the darkness. Whosoever
               standeth in darkness, seeth not, and is unseen; and he discerneth not, and is not
               discerned; and he knoweth not, and is not known; but he is deprived of the beauty of
               the appearance of created things, and all who themselves see are removed from his
               sight; and he discerneth not the path and understandeth not the way; and he seeth not
               the passage of those who go by. Now that this may not happen to us, let us be at all
               times occupied in the word of God, not merely bringing it up in repetition upon the
               tongue, but with the understanding meditating and thinking thereupon with the mind,
               so that at all times our mouth may speak through the superabundance of our heart. For
               what the mind meditateth upon in secret, that will the tongue speak openly, however
               careful a man may be; and if the tongue remaineth quiet through craftiness from that
               which it would speak, the secrets of the heart are made manifest to beholders by
               other means and motions of the senses, and the face by its various expressions giveth
               indications concerning the secret mind which hideth in the soul. Whosoever drinketh
               continually of the doctrine of God, the tree of his own person yieldeth divine fruit
               at all times, if it be not that he heareth the word of doctrine from mere habit, and
               that he listeneth not unto the helpful <pb n="155"/>word of God for pleasure's sake,
               and that he receiveth it not that he may increase in him human knowledge thereby, <pb
                  type="external" n="161"/>and that he listeneth not to learn it so that it may be
               for him the material of the handicraft of vain-glory. For the doctrine which is
               spoken in knowledge, and is heard with discernment, manifesteth spiritual fruit in
               two places, in the tongue of him that soweth it, and in the ear of him that receiveth
               it, because both the man who teacheth and the man who learneth hear his word gladly
               if he be an exact teacher, and if he be not a mere passage for the doctrine of
               others.</p>
            <p>Now continuous labour at a handicraft addeth unto the knowledge thereof, and a man
               traineth all [his] faculties in working at it. And thus also meditation at all times
               in the word of doctrine moveth the thoughts to knowledge, and sharpeneth the tongue
               for speech, and bindeth the understanding in the contemplation of God. And whosoever
               meditateth upon God at all times, having this remembrance constant within his soul
               secretly, in him also is increased the fear of God, which becometh unto him a wall
               which protecteth from all evil things. For as the wall of a city protecteth its
               inhabitants from the harmful attacks of [their] enemies, so also doth the fear of God
               protect a man from enemies, and from those who would spoil our souls, and it keepeth
               back the body from the working of the lusts [thereof], and it protecteth the soul
               from abominable thoughts. Whosoever hath learned in very truth to fear God not only
               preserveth his body from the lusts [thereof], but also his heart from abominable
               motions. Now what the manner of the fear of God is, and in what grade standeth the
                  <pb n="156"/>man who feareth God, <pb type="external" n="162"/>and how this fear
               is to be acquired, and by what things it is increased, it is meet for us to shew
               forth, according to what we have learned from those who were before us spectators of
               knowledge, and ministers of the word of teaching. Now according to what they have
               taught me, the true fear of God is produced from true faith, and whosoever believeth
               truly will himself also fear Him in Whom he believeth. And as his faith existeth not
               by means of plans and devices, so also his fear consisteth not of skill and
               knowledge; for as soon as a man believeth that God is, he beginneth to receive the
               doctrine of His commandments. For faith itself is born of the simplicity of nature,
               and it is established and protected entirely by simplicity. Now those commandments
               which faith heareth and accepteth, doth the fear of God keep; for in the manner in
               which simplicity preserveth faith, doth also the fear of God keep His commandments.
               Now by <quote>fear" I do not mean the fear which a man meaneth when he sayeth by word of
               mouth, <quote>I fear God,</quote> nor that fear which existeth in many who are habitually thought
               to be fearers of God; but I mean the fear which is excited in the soul naturally, and
               when the soul which is within trembleth and tottereth, it moveth together with itself
               all the members of the body. For the body is afraid of that which can injure it, and
               the soul also <pb type="external" n="163"/>is moved at that which hath power to
               destroy it. For as is the fear of the body of external things which can injure it, of
               wild beasts, or of fire, or of swords and of scrapers, or of drowning in the water,
               or of falling from lofty rocks, or of the rumour of thieves, or of the sight of
               judges, or of painful <pb n="157"/>lashes, or of fetterings and imprisonment, so also
               is the soul naturally afraid of the hidden Judge Who is able to punish it with
               spiritual afflictions, according to its nature, together with the body. And as the
               body is naturally afraid of all these things which we have enumerated, even so is the
               soul naturally afraid of the remembrance of the judgment of God, and of the
               punishments which are laid up for those who provoke to wrath, and of the <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>
               which is threatened for those who work wickedness, and of the report of the outer
               darkness, and of the rumour of the fire which is not quenched, and of the worm which
               dieth not. For when the body seeth the things which can injure it, it is afraid of
               them, and when the soul looketh upon the things which can torment it, it is
               affrighted at them. The body is not excited by the machinations which exist to do it
               harm, but immediately it seeth them, or it meditateth upon the remembrance of them,
               it becometh excited and is afraid of them naturally. And thus also is it with the
               soul, for when, with the eye of faith, it looketh at the things which are threatened
               in the future, and it seeth inwardly the fearful things which the word of the Judge
               hath revealed, it is straightway filled with fear, and all its thoughts—which are its
               spiritual members—tremble, and by reason of its trembling, the body also trembleth,
               and through the fear of its thoughts the members of its body are also afraid. And as
               the soul itself participateth in the fear of the body, <pb type="external" n="164"
               />so also is the body mingled in the fear of the soul; for although the nature of the
               soul cannot be injured by the things which do harm to the body, yet, inasmuch as it
               is mingled therewith, it feareth therewith. And although the afflictions and <pb
                  n="158"/>punishments which are about to come are not visible to the eyes of the
               body, yet because the soul seeth them inwardly it trembleth and is affrighted at
               them; and the body is also moved with it, and fear and terror take up their abode in
               all its members. For according to the experience of facts it is thus, and those who
               have had experience thereof, and have received the test thereof in their own persons
               know that immediately the soul remembereth the judgment of God, it shaketh at the
               remembrance thereof, and together with itself it maketh all the members of the body
               shake with one accord. When the soul and body of a man are not purified from sin,
               immediately he remembereth God he is forthwith wholly and entirely filled with fear,
               and all his members tremble, in the manner in which his body trembleth when it seeth
               suddenly that which can destroy and do it harm. And if a man hath not experienced
               this in his own person—for not every man hath arrived at the measure of natural fear
               of God—from the fact that the body being moved, it moveth the soul also with it—which
               is manifest and well known unto every man—we may also understand that the soul is
               capable of fear and that it poureth out its fear upon the body, which only the few
               have experienced, that is to say, those whose souls are not dead in the death of sin,
               because the sin which happeneth carnally outside the remembrance of God, is the
               complete death of the soul, even as <pb type="external" n="165"/>the Holy Book
               calleth the sinner dead which repenteth not. For repentance ariseth from the
               remembrance of God by a man, so then whosoever sinneth, and in whom the remembrance
               of the judgment of God is not moved, either when he sinneth, or after his <pb n="159"
               />committing sin, this man is dead in his own soul, although in the body he appeareth
               to be alive. By the constant remembrance of God then may the soul which liveth be
               known; and if it sinneth and repenteth it is a sick thing, but if it sinneth carnally
               without repentance and without the remembrance of God, from this it is made manifest
               that it hath been slain by sin. For the knowledge of God is itself the spiritual life
               of the soul, even as the life of the body consisteth of the abiding of the soul which
               is therein within it; and its life is known by its perceiving everything which
               draweth nigh to it, or which it itself approacheth. And thus also the life of the
               soul is the knowledge of God, and it is known that it liveth from the fact that it is
               sensible of God.</p>
            <p>For the body which is dead cannot feel any harm, neither can the soul which is slain
               feel the remembrance of the judgment of God. And whatever pains and tortures thou
               mayest bring upon the dead body it feeleth them not, and if thou wert to make the
               soul which is once dead to God a participator in all wickedness it would feel it not.
               If the dead body be struck it perceiveth it not, and if it be hacked and hewn in
               pieces it feeleth it not, and thus is it with the soul which is dead to God. It
               sinneth, and perceiveth it not; it doeth wickedness, and knoweth it not; it sinneth,
               and is unmindful of it; it is condemned, and its conscience pricketh it not; it doeth
               evil, and feeleth it not; and as its conscience pricketh it not to discretion <pb
                  type="external" n="166"/>when it fulfilleth naturally the things which are its
               natural need, even so the soul which is destroyed by sin, and is once dead to God, is
               not condemned by its conscience for the things which are wrought by it.</p>
            <p>So then the remembrance of God is the life of the <pb n="160"/>soul. And as all the
               motions of the body are constant, and it moveth and is moved throughout by all its
               nerves and members so long as it participateth in life, even so the soul which hath
               therein the knowledge of God, moveth and is moved at all times by the remembrance of
               God, and so long as it remembereth God, it sinneth not. And if it happeneth that for
               a brief space the light of its knowledge becometh obscured through the smoke of lust,
               the remembrance of God is straightway stirred up in it, and the fear which ariseth
               therefrom driveth it to repentance. For the fear of God worketh two things in the
               soul: it keepeth a man that he sin not, or if he sinneth, it urgeth him to heal his
               sin in repentance; for it is the habit of all those with whom the fear of God or the
               fear of man is found, that they either offend not, or when they have offended they
               rectify their wrongdoing.</p>
            <p>The fear of God then is a shield against all wickedness; it guardeth the man who is
               behind it from being harmed, and it is a wall of protection against all abominable
               things; now there are times when it becometh the healer of wickedness, even as both
               qualities <pb type="external" n="167"/>—that of healer and that of protector—may be
               seen in this fear. For it is a protecting wall against evils that they come not, and
               it is a wise healer of the wickedness which is wrought by negligence. One man is
               terrified at the very sight of the judge, and another trembleth at the mere mention
               of him. The man who taketh heed that he sin not is restrained from wickedness by the
               sight of the judge; but the man who, after he hath sinned, turneth to repentance is
               terrified at the rumour of him, and he is affrighted <pb n="161"/>at the mere sound
               of his judgment. In the act of committing his sin he is unable to see him, for sin is
               the blindness of the soul; and when sin is wrought and ministered unto in the person
               of a man, the sight of the soul is obscured by the vapour of the work of lust as by
               much smoke, and it is unable to see the Judge. It heareth, however, the voice of His
               threatenings from the mouth of others—that is to say from the Holy Books—and it
               trembleth at the report thereof, and is afraid when it heareth them; now this
               happeneth while the soul is not entirely dead to the knowledge and perception of God.
               And the man also who is blind in his natural body is not terrified by the sight of
               dangers, neither is he afraid of them, except by the report which he heareth from
               others. For the lion which would come to crush him cannot be seen by him, nor the
               serpent which hisseth to sting him; but if he heareth the report of them from another
               man, he is frightened. And again, the rock or the pit which is in front of his
               footsteps he seeth not; but if another reveal to him <pb type="external" n="168"/>the
               danger which is before him, fear preventeth him, and he straightway checketh himself,
               and turneth back; but whosoever hath sound sight naturally hath no need to learn
               concerning these things from others, for his sight teacheth him concerning the harm
               of his body. After this manner let us also consider the one who taketh heed unto
               himself and sinneth not, and the other who having sinned repenteth of his evil; for
               the soul is not afraid of the dangers of the body, although it must be imagined that
               it feareth because it is mingled therewith. And when the soul feareth the things
               which are here, its fear is outside its own nature, that is to say, the vapour of <pb
                  n="162"/>bodily fear goeth up upon it, and darkeneth its power of discernment, and
               together with the body it is afraid of those things which cannot harm it. But if the
               soul is afraid of God its fear is natural, for the natural fear of the soul is that
               it should fear God alone; for the body is not naturally afraid of God, nor doth the
               soul naturally fear wild animals or any other harmful things. And behold, beasts, and
               wild animals, and birds, because they are body only, and participate not in a living
               soul, have not in their nature any fear of God; they only fear death by each other,
               or by other things which are opposed to them. And similarly the body also feareth
               only the dangers which belong to itself; now if thou liftest up the soul to
               participate in its thoughts, the body feeleth with it the fear of God, <pb
                  type="external" n="169"/>even as the soul feeleth with the body in its fear of
               wild animals. For the Judge Who can torment the soul is God Himself only, because He
               Who is more subtle of nature than the soul is alone able to be the Judge thereof; but
               the children of men may be judges of the body, and they are able even to kill it,
               although in their judgment they have no power over the soul, even according to the
               testimony of the word of <persName>Christ</persName> which saith, <quote>Fear not those which kill the body,
               but who are not able to kill the soul;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n162-1"/> for the dominion of judges extendeth
               over the body only, and it can they judge, and torment, and slay. But as for the
               soul, its nature is exalted above the injury of those who can slay [it], and it
               cannot burn in their fire, and their stripes cannot fall upon its spiritual nature,
               and it cannot be cut in pieces by their swords, and its person cannot be lacerated
                  <pb n="163"/>by their tools of torture; for he that judgeth is of the body, and
               the sentence which he passeth on evil doers he uttereth with the tongue of the body,
               although the soul moveth inwardly the deliberation of the penalty. And all the
               members which are ready [to receive] the sufferings are of the body, and through
               bodily sufferings the body alone receiveth injury; but the nature of the soul,
               because of its spirituality, is exalted and raised above these things. And however
               deeply the sufferings may penetrate, they sink into the body only, and however far in
               and deep they may pierce, the soul is situated more deeply within, and the death of
               these members hath no power over its life. Now judges are not able to kill the soul,
               and therefore it is not meet for men to be afraid of their judgment; <quote>but fear Him
               that is able to destroy both the body and the soul <pb type="external" n="170"/>in
               <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n163-1"/> The Lord Himself alone is the Judge of the soul, and He that
               made it a living thing is Himself able to bring death upon its life, and to torment
               its spiritual nature by a spiritual sentence of judgment; and because the soul
               perceiveth that the Lord alone is its Judge it is afraid of Him naturally. And as
               with those who are alive in the body and are dead in their souls the remembrance of
               the judgment of [the] world restraineth them from their evil actions, so also doth
               the remembrance of the judgment of God check the man who is alive in his soul from
               his wickedness, and as long as he remembereth His judgment he keepeth himself from
               sin. The judgment which is near is not depicted before the eyes of the wise man, but
               upon that which is afar off he looketh intently, <pb n="164"/>and he trembleth and is
               affrighted thereat. For as the things which are manifest are revealed to the eye of
               the body, so also are the things which are hidden revealed to the eye of faith. And
               as the body which is alive perceiveth all the material things of this world, so also
               doth the soul which is alive feel all the spiritual things of the world which is to
               come, and it beholdeth them spiritually.</p>
            <p>So therefore the remembrance of God is the light which sheweth the things which are
               to come, and where there is sin the making mention of His name causeth terror; but
               unless the conscience of a man in sin prick him, the fear of the future Judge will
               not prick him, for as is every man towards himself, even so is he towards the
               remembrance of God. If he standeth in the grade of sinners, <pb type="external"
                  n="171"/>God appeareth to him as a Judge; but if he hath gone up into the other
               grade of penitents, He sheweth Himself to him as one Who forgiveth. And again, if he
               standeth in the state of loving-kindness, he looketh at the riches of God's
               loving-kindness; if he be clothed with humility and meekness, the favour of God is
               apparent before him; if he hath acquired an understanding mind, he looketh at the
               unsurpassable wisdom of God; if he cease from anger and be free from wrath, and peace
               and quietness be moved in him at all times, he is lifted up to see the untroubled
               sincerity of God; and if the motions of faith are constantly rising within his soul,
               he at all times observeth the incomprehensibility of the works of God, and those
               things also which are thought to be simple he maketh sure that they are beyond [his]
               knowledge.</p>
            <p>Now if a man standeth in the exalted state of <pb n="165"/>spiritual love, according
               to the state in which he is doth God appear to him, that is, He is wholly and
               entirely love. And this is a thing to be wondered at; although God is single in His
               nature, and He hath neither parts nor members, He appeareth unto every man in many
               [different] forms, and to whomsoever seeketh He appeareth on every side that He
               wisheth. And as in respect of Himself He is One, and hath no similitudes, He
               appeareth to minds in similitudes, according to the feelings which are nigh unto the
               soul. Whosoever wisheth to see that God is good, let him himself be good, and behold,
               He will appear to him to be good. Imagine not that thou wilt see God as a good Being
               whilst thou standest in a place of wickedness, for this sight would work sluggishness
               in thee, <pb type="external" n="172"/>and thou wouldst see God as He wisheth not to
               be seen by thee, that is to say, thou wouldst not see Him at all, because thou
               wishest to see Him outside His will; for until thou hast become like unto Him in
               every one of the virtues which He hath commanded thee to keep, He appeareth to thee
               as He is; and if thou thinkest that thou seest [Him], thou seest Him only in thy
               imagination, and not His true appearance. Now therefore everyone who standeth in a
               place of sin, and who feeleth that there are evil passions within him, and whose
               conscience pricketh him because of his wrong-doing, must look upon God as the Judge
               Who condemneth; and he must not dare to regard Him differently, lest thereby he may
               increase in himself the fear which will remove evil things from him. If now thou
               wishest to see God as One Who forgiveth, put away thy wickedness, and draw nigh to
               repentance, and put away also the sin which others <pb n="166"/>have sinned against
               thee; then shalt thou lift up the eye of thy understanding, and thou shalt see the
               One Who forgiveth. The man who sinneth continually, and worketh folly, and who
               thinketh that God is One Who forgiveth, heapeth up wickedness upon wickedness. Put
               not your trust in remission of sins, lest thou heap up sin upon sin; for many sin
               continually, and without repentance, relying upon pardon, never having felt pardon,
               and having heard only of the report of pardon. The man who forgiveth others is
               himself able to feel the pardon of God, and after this manner also is every good
               thing of God; until we have become the doers of good we cannot perceive that it is in
               God. For from hearing hath every man learned that God is good, but from knowledge of
               the soul <pb type="external" n="173"/>alone it is that those who are good perceive
               His goodness; and from the rumour which is uttered every man confesseth that He is
               merciful, and long-suffering, and of great kindness, and that He is wholly and
               entirely filled with love. Those who have kept these things in their own persons
               through the perception of their soul experience them in God. Now therefore so long as
               thou standest in the place of sin, thou art bound to be mindful of the judgment of
               God, that by the remembrance of His judgment thou mayest drive away thy wickedness,
               and thou must not dare to think of Him in any other manner, so long as thou standest
               in the place of sin. For the place of fear is one, and the place of joy is another.
               The place of fear belongeth to penitents, and to those who feel their sins, and to
               the men who are not as yet free from [their] passions; but the place of joy is above
               love. After the victory over lusts a man is deemed worthy to arrive at joy, and when
               he <pb n="167"/>hath brought all his passions under the power of his thoughts, he
               then goeth into the country of joy, where there is neither terror nor fear, to live
               gloriously. Now fear is the opposite of joy, and where there is fear joy is not born,
               and where there is joy fear cometh not; because fear is an accessory of wickedness,
               and joy of goodness; and as goodness is the opposite of wickedness, so also is joy
               the opposite of fear. The man who [liveth] in wickedness perceiveth not the joy of
               the spirit when it is born of goodness, and the man who [liveth] in joy feeleth not
               the fear which is closely united to wickedness. That a man should wish to [live] in
               joy while <pb type="external" n="174"/>he yet standeth in the region of fear, is like
               unto the man who imagineth himself to be good while he is evil, and while he
               fulfilleth all abominable things, or unto the man who imagineth himself to be rich
               while he is actually the poorest of men.</p>
            <p>Everyone then who is conscious of his own follies and evil doings is bound to
               increase within himself at all times the fear of God, and he must meditate upon it in
               his going out and coming in, and he must deliberate upon it when he sitteth down, and
               when he riseth up, and during all his acts and deeds must his thoughts be filled with
               the fear of God. And one certain time must not be set apart for this fear, but all
               times must be to him times for the fear of God. When this fear springeth not up in a
               man, contempt for the commandments of God is found in him, and his thoughts are sunk
               in the sleep of error; and like a vessel without sense he meditateth wickedness, and
               doeth abominable things, and he sinneth, but knoweth not that he sinneth. But if he
               knoweth, it is the <pb n="168"/>knowledge of hearing and not of the truth, because
               the certain knowledge of wickedness straightway formeth fear in a man. And as when
               the eyes are opened the light shineth in through the pupils, so also is it with the
               remembrance of God; for immediately the fear of God shineth into the mind, it rouseth
               a man and it maketh him to rise up as out of the depth of slumber. And it is as if
               the light should shine upon a man who is plucked away into the depth of slumber, and
               although he be ready to get up forthwith, it should find him upon his bed; and when
               he openeth <pb type="external" n="175"/>his eyes, and seeth it, he is straightway
               roused and greatly moved, and his sudden fright speedily driveth away from him all
               the heaviness of the sleep in which he was plunged. And so if a man be careless, and
               the wakefulness of the remembrance of God be taken away from him, and he remain in
               the sleep of contempt and the abyss of carelessness, if it happen that either for one
               reason or another, or by his own will, the light of the remembrance of God shineth in
               his soul, he is straightway roused and he casteth away his former contempt, and he is
               filled with fear, and the terror at the remembrance of the righteousness of the Judge
               groweth strong in him; and when contempt hath gone out from him, repentance therefor
               entereth into him straightway, and he is filled with trembling, either on account of
               the things which have been done by him, or on account of the wasted seasons which he
               hath enjoyed without the remembrance of God. For behold, the man who liveth in this
               remembrance is filled at all times with fear immediately an ordinary motion of lust
               flieth over his soul, and he is greatly moved and is roused by reason of the lustful
               thought <pb n="169"/>which hath come to him; and this thought of wickedness
               straightway fleeth, and is destroyed before the fear of the soul, even as a bird
               which riseth up unexpectedly before a man, who is thereby suddenly startled out of
               his composure.</p>
            <p>Now fear and shame of the children of men preserve the body from lusts, but the fear
               and shame which man hath of God preserve the motions of the soul from thoughts of
               evil things; and because man seeth that at all times God seeth him, he becometh
               perpetually an observer <pb type="external" n="176"/>of himself that he sin not, and
               he preserveth his inner man from the secret blemishes upon which the hidden eye of
               God looketh. Hedge thyself round then with a fence of the fear of God, O man of
               understanding, and evil things will not dare to enter into the city of thy soul. Be
               thou ashamed before God inwardly, and behold thy soul shall be preserved in its
               purity; excite within thee at all times the fear of Him, and behold thou shalt be
               kept from sins of the thoughts. Let the continual remembrance of Him abide in thee,
               and the remembrance of wickedness cannot sojourn with thee. For so long as thou art
               mindful of God it is not possible for thee to remember evil things; because light and
               darkness cannot dwell in the eye together, neither can the remembrance of God and the
               remembrance of wickedness abide together within the soul. Until thou forgettest God
               thou canst not be mindful of wickedness, and until thou forgettest wickedness, the
               remembrance of God riseth not in thee; for the error of the one is the remembrance of
               the other, and the going in of one is the going out of the other. And the remembrance
               of wickedness is error, and the remembrance of God <pb n="170"/>is true knowledge;
               and error is darkness, but knowledge is light. And as modesty is near unto the man
               who standeth in the light, so also is the soul, into which the remembrance of God
               shineth, always constant in shamefacedness at the nakedness of wickedness. And as the
               sight of men frighteneth a man to cover his nakedness, so also when the remembrance
               of God looketh <pb type="external" n="177"/>into the soul, it dazeth it, and maketh
               it quickly to be ashamed, and it suddenly spreadeth over itself the garment of
               modesty. And if it hath any member of darkness which is manifest, it covereth it; and
               if it containeth any thing which is not seemly thereto, it is straightway terrified
               and casteth it away. And if it be confused, it setteth itself in order; and if it be
               in turmoil, it composeth itself; and if it sinneth, it maketh itself just; and if it
               be spotted, it maketh itself white; and if it be foul, it purifieth itself; and if it
               be unclean, it sanctifieth itself; and if it be polluted, it is made clean; and if it
               be impure it is made chaste; and if it be wanton, it becometh modest; and if it be
               foolish, it is made wise; and if it be poured out, it is gathered together; and if it
               wander outside itself, it returneth to itself; and if it be poverty-stricken, it
               gaineth wealth; and if it hath lost its life, it runneth and seeketh it; and if it be
               sick, it is healed; and if it be feeble, it is made strong; and if it be infirm, it
               is healed; and if it hath in it a breaking [of bones], it bindeth them up; and if it
               be filled with gaping wounds it presseth them together; and if it happen that it hath
               grown old, and hath become worn out in sin, straightway the remembrance of God,
               together with the fear of Him, maketh it new.</p>
            <p>Therefore the experience of the fear of God <pb n="171"/>belongeth to the soul, and
               man himself is alone able to know by it whether he feareth God or not. Each one of us
               is bound to take this good thing within himself. If thou art mindful of God, and if
               thou art moved when thou rememberest him, and art straightway filled with fear, and
               thy thoughts and thy members tremble, and thy soul and body are moved, and thy
               knowledge boweth down its head, and thy understanding is ashamed before God inwardly,
               if these things happen unto thee thou mayest know <pb type="external" n="178"/>that
               thou hast the fear of God in thee, and that the remembrance of the Lord is in very
               truth near unto thee. For it is not the man who saith, <quote>I fear God,</quote> who feareth God,
               but the man who experienceth within himself the things which I have said is he who is
               truly a fearer of God. The good deeds which are seen outwardly do not prove that the
               doer of them is in truth a fearer of God, because the causes which work good deeds
               among the children of men are many, and there are various ways of keeping the
               commandments. The man who keepeth God's commandments through fear of him, is a true
               servant, and a divine labourer who feareth Him that laid down the law, and he
               fulfilleth His law; and moreover the divine law cannot be kept wholly unless it be
               kept by the body and by the soul. <choice><sic>There</sic><corr>There are</corr></choice> many who bear the weight of
               spiritual labours outwardly, but who inwardly minister unto all wickedness; and there
               are others who have bound their limbs with the fetters of afflictions, but who have
               sent away and dismissed their thoughts to wander after abominable things; and there
               are others who are outwardly clothed in chastity, but who are clothed with wantonness
               within; and there are others who to outward appearance fast, but who <pb n="172"
               />inwardly are prodigals and gluttons; and there are others who outwardly appear to
               be righteous, but who secretly work all wickedness. One man keeping a fast, eateth;
               and another professing poverty, is a lover of money; and another, professing
               outwardly to be long-suffering, is a man of wrath, for his patient endurance
               appeareth outwardly, but anger secretly dwelleth within him. One man excuseth himself
               from pleasures outwardly, but he seeketh for them secretly; and another cannot be
               constrained to hear the word of blasphemy, but inwardly he blasphemeth actually at
               all times. <pb type="external" n="179"/>One man prayeth openly, and another prayeth
               in secret; one man singeth Psalms with his tongue, and another singeth them with his
               understanding. One man crucifieth his body only, and another crucifieth his soul
               together with his body. One man keepeth himself from sin that he may not be
               reproached by man, and another restraineth himself from it because of the love of
               righteousness. One man standeth in awe at the face of God, and another is ashamed
               before the face of the children of men. One man hateth to sin because he knoweth that
               sin is hateful to God; and another taketh heed not to commit iniquity because he
               seeth that wickedness is disgraceful in the sight of men. One man sinneth not through
               fear of the judgment which is beyond [this world], and another committeth not
               offences through fear of the judgment which is nigh. One through the remembrance of
               the fire which is near cooleth the lust of his members, and maketh its motions to be
               at rest; and another through the remembrance of the <placeName>Gehenna</placeName> which is afar off
               allayeth his lust and destroyeth it.</p>
            <p>So therefore the labours which are visible are not <pb n="173"/>alone sufficient to
               prove a man to be a fearer of God; do thou then, O man of understanding, examine
               thyself, and let thy testimony be from and in thyself, if the fear of God be in thy
               soul. For by the righteousness which dwelleth within is the fear of God made, but
               that fear which dwelleth without, and the course of the actions of which is external,
               the sight of man inciteth thereto, and its agency is external, and not internal, and
               it is only seen by the eyes of men, and it is not wrought for the sight of God
               inwardly.</p>
            <p>The afflictions which can be seen are good because they compel <pb type="external"
                  n="180"/>the limbs to become obedient to the thoughts, and they subdue the stony
               nature of the body, and make it to become subservient to the soul, but they do not
               cleanse the understanding from the motions of sins, and they do not make the soul to
               fear God, unless the soul hath learned inwardly to fear God; for the hidden service
               belongeth to the soul, and the labour which is manifest belongeth to the body. The
               labour of the body cannot be justified without the service of the soul, but the
               service of the soul can be justified even without the labours of the body, if it be
               that a man doth not excuse himself from labours through contempt, and he doth not
               flee from afflictions like a man who loveth pleasures. For the sight of men doth not
               protect the outward and inner man from sins, but the sight of the fear of God doth
               restrain the body and soul from sins; and as the man who standeth before the judge to
               be questioned concerning his wrong-doing hath no means wherewith to act corruptly
               before the judge, but is anxious to hide also his former offences, so also the man
               before whose sight the fear of God the Judge is set, and the <pb n="174"/>fear of
               Whom striketh his thoughts at all times, cannot sin, but by day, and by night, and at
               all times he putteth on chastity and modesty over his inner man, and every motion of
               sin which riseth up in him he driveth away from him in the fear of God. The fear
               which is of God maketh beautiful the inner man, but the fear which is of men adorneth
               with virtues the outer man; <pb type="external" n="181"/>He Who is the Judge of thy
               works shall also be the One Who shall approve of thy contest, and the fear of Him
               must be set before thine eyes continually.</p>
            <p>For if the fear of masters is set before the sight of their servants, and the dread
               of kings, and of judges, and of generals clotheth always those who have been subdued
               by them, and those who are subject unto them—and moreover the fear of teachers and
               masters preserveth and guardeth continually the innocency of childhood—how much more
               binding is it upon that man who hath become a disciple of God, and who is naturally a
               servant of the Heavenly Lord, and a soldier of the Everlasting King, and a subject of
               the Judge of the truth of the law, that the fear of Him should rule continually over
               his whole course of life, and over his thoughts in secret, and over his members
               outwardly? The fear of God is a bridle which holdeth back the violent impulses of a
               man from the error of wickedness, and it driveth him back from the pursuit of
               abominable lusts, not in his outer man only, but more especially in his inner man.
               The spiritual soldier should not fear God only as servants fear their masters, or as
               people who have been conquered fear kings and judges, for the fear of them decks
               itself in outward forms, and it appeareth externally on the members of <pb n="175"
               />the body only; for although it may happen that they hate them inwardly, and despise
               them in their thoughts, yet outwardly they manifest to them the guise of fear. Let
               then thy fear of God be not like unto this, but from the place on which He looketh,
               from there let it shew fear, and where He seeth <pb type="external" n="182"/>secretly
               the motions of thy soul, there let the power of His fear lay hold upon thee. And let
               thy whole being—both thy inner man, and thy outer man—entirely fear God, Who is the
               Judge of thy secret things, and of those which are manifest. Let thy soul be ashamed
               before Him, and sin not, and let thy thought be shamefaced, and commit no wickedness.
               For if the shame of the children of men driveth us from sin, how much more should the
               shame of God restrain us from wickedness?</p>
            <p>Remember thou then at all times that God looketh at thee, and do thou thyself also
               look at Him inwardly, even as He seeth thee inwardly, and sin shall not abide in thy
               thoughts. For as in the place whereupon the sun looketh darkness abideth not, even so
               in the soul upon which God looketh, and which itself also feeleth that He is
               regarding it, the darkness of wickedness remaineth not. <quote>The eyes of the Lord are ten
               thousand times brighter than the Sun,</quote> saith the Holy Book, <quote>and He seeth all the
               works of the children of men.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n176-1"/> And in another place it saith, <quote>All the deeds
               of men shine as the sun before Him, and He examineth and knoweth their
               ways.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n176-2"/> Now the <persName>prophet of God</persName> also rebuketh by his speech the wickedness
               of that man who is without the fear of God, and who upon the cushion of his couch
               acteth abominably, <pb n="176"/>and rebuking his stupid thought that God could not
               see him, for God doth see him, he brought forward this proof saying, <quote>The eyes of the
               Lord are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,</quote> in order that he might teach
               every man that God seeth our secret things, and that we should take heed with all
               diligence against the sins which are wrought in secret. For thou shalt not sin in thy
               thought, <pb type="external" n="183"/>neither shalt thou do wickedly in thy house in
               secret, because God seeth thee especially in these secret things. Immediately the
               sight of the children of men is turned away from thee, the sight of God receiveth
               thee; and when the children of men no longer look at thee as thou art, the Lord of
               what hath been formed observeth thee the more, for He knoweth that as long as man
               looketh upon thee that thou wilt be watchful against [doing] before them the deeds of
               shame, and that fear and shamefacedness of them will drive thee from the deeds of
               sin. So then when thou art alone, and the walls and the roof of thy house hide thee
               on all sides, the armour of the fear of God is necessary for thee, for in the
               darkness sin is readily committed; and then art thou bound to rouse up thyself to the
               remembrance of God, and thou must strengthen thy members that they be not conquered
               before lust, and thou must stand up like a man against the sin which warreth against
               thee to overcome thee, and against the secret Enemy who with the motions of thy lust
               fighteth with thy life.</p>
            <p>The thoughts of the soul hide within the members of the body, and as the body hideth
               within the house, even so do the thoughts of the soul hide themselves under the
               covering of the body. And because the man who is within cannot easily be seen
               corporeally, he <pb n="177"/>sinneth quickly, and every time he wisheth, he doeth
               wickedly. The sin of the thoughts is more easy and light than the sin of the members,
               because the members are restrained and impeded by many things; but immediately the
               thought wisheth to sin, it fulfilleth in itself the act of sin. <pb type="external"
                  n="184"/>And neither time, nor place, nor material, is necessary for sin, for as
               is the swiftness of the movement, so also is the swiftness of its sin, and against
               this swiftness which the thought hath is the persistence of the remembrance of God
               necessary, and the perpetual fear of the Judge of secret things must abide therein.
               And, if we may say so, the motion of the fear of God must be swifter in him than the
               motion of his thought, so that when the thought of sin hath been moved the
               remembrance of God may smite it at once. The soul upon which this bridle hath been
               cast is silently dumb to the motions of hateful thoughts, and if it happen that it be
               seized suddenly, this remembrance checketh it, and turneth it back that it may look
               upon its own person.</p>
            <p>Now therefore there is none of the virtues which is not preserved by the fear of God,
               and if a man were to call the fear of God <quote>a guard-house of virtues,</quote> he would not do
               wrong. For faith is confirmed thereby, it preserveth fasting, through the remembrance
               of it prayers are made constant with us, it urgeth [us] to give alms, it quieteth the
               abominable motions which are in the soul, it quencheth the lust which burneth in the
               members, it purifieth filthy thoughts, it uprooteth the meditation of abominable
               things from the soul, it maketh it empty of thoughts, and anger and enmity, it
               driveth the mind of every man from daring to lust for that which is not his own, it
               stablisheth laws that they be <pb n="178"/>not trodden under foot, it counselleth men
               that the divine commandments be not transgressed; and it is a boundary against <pb
                  type="external" n="185"/>all wickedness, and like a shield it standeth against all
               abominable things. It standeth against the left hand, and inciteth to the right with
               noble deeds; it doeth away with wickedness, and stirreth up to the service of the
               virtues. The fear of God also preventeth wickedness from being wrought. It keepeth a
               man back from the path of iniquity, and it ministereth unto good in two ways, for it
               keepeth a man from the way of wickedness, and maketh him watchful to travel in the
               path of virtue, and it inciteth him to gather together noble things, and it turneth
               and guardeth what hath been gathered together by him; for if there was no fear [of
               God], corruption would rule over everything. It followeth judges, and for this reason
               their commandments are established firmly; it surroundeth kings, and therefore their
               laws are not transgressed; it cleaveth to governors, and therefore their rule is
               formidable to those who are subject unto them; and it keepeth all men in the faith of
               God. Now although the fear [of God] is born of faith, yet it itself is also the
               preserver of faith. Whosoever feareth God taketh heed not to transgress the boundary
               of the faith of God, and whosoever believeth in God himself draweth nigh to the fear
               of God, and the man, in whose soul the fear of God dwelleth, himself becometh a
               watchful guardian of all the commandments. <persName>Adam</persName> believed in God, and he was not
               afraid of God; he believed that He was, and he received from Him the law which He
               delivered into him. And because he cast out the fear of God from his mind, he forsook
               the faith, and trod the law under foot. </p>
            <pb n="179"/>
            <p>For He that ordained the law <pb type="external" n="186"/>involved the commandment
               with fear: <quote>In the day that thou eatest of the tree, thou shalt die the
               death.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n179-1"/> And because <persName>Adam</persName> had cast out from him that fear, he believed the
               crafty one instead of God, and trod under foot the law which had been ordained by the
               Judge. And not only <persName>Adam</persName> did God surround with fear that it might be a fence for
               the keeping of His commandments, but in all generations, to all the commandments
               which He ordained did He unite fear. Over <persName>Cain</persName>, who did not fear God of his own
               freewill, did fear rule of necessity, and he became a vagabond and a wanderer in the
               earth; for because he did not fear the One Who was worthy to be feared, he was filled
               with fears at everything which appeared unto him. And by reason of the torture of
               fear he entreated God and besought Him that whosoever found him might kill him, so
               that he might flee from a life filled with fear and dread. And God also gave the law
               by the hand of <persName>Moses</persName>, which was filled with many and divers commandments, and to
               all the commandments He linked fear, for without fear the commandments would not be
               kept. <quote>Thou shalt do no murder,</quote> and <quote>whosoever slayeth shall be slain;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n179-2"/> for
               the sickness He ordained the medicine of fear, that it might not increase and grow
               strong in iniquity. <quote>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</quote> and <quote>whosoever committed
               adultery shall be slain;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n179-3"/> and fear keepeth [this] commandment from being
               held in contempt. </p>
            <pb n="180"/>
            <p>For by fear He checked them from doing wickedness to one another, and because He saw
               that they loved wickedness, He restrained them from their [evil] deed by the fear of
               the judgment. Where there is no love, <pb type="external" n="187"/>it is fear that
               keepeth the commandments. There are three things through which all commandments are
               kept; by fear, or by reward, or by love. Of all these the first is fear, and the
               second is the possessions which are promised, and the third is true love; the first
               belongeth to servants, and the second belongeth to hirelings, and the third belongeth
               to spiritual beings and friends. Now the beginning of the way of the conduct and life
               of <persName>Christ</persName> is accompanied by fear, for unto every one who beginneth to learn this
               doctrine cleaveth the mind of a child, and fear is seemly unto childhood, and it
               urgeth it to receive instruction. For childhood is unable to taste the sweets of
               knowledge, and on this account it is meet that fear should accompany it; for when it
               has tasted the knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>, and a man hath felt the power of His
               commandments, the pleasantness itself of what he tasteth leadeth him to the keeping
               of the commandments. But so long as a man hath not arrived at this state, it is
               necessary for fear to be his nurse, and a teacher, and a reminder of all the
               commandments. And as the children of nature receive instruction from teachers, and
               the schoolmaster receiveth them that he may be unto them at all times a reminder of
               what they have heard, so also doth a man receive the doctrine of the commandments
               from God, Who is the true Teacher and Doctor.</p>
            <p>So then fear must straightway be used, that, like the schoolmaster, it may remind a
               man of what he hath <pb n="181"/>received; and that if he forgetteth, it may remind
               him; and if he be negligent, it may stir him up; and if <pb type="external" n="188"
               />he sleep, it may awake him; and if he love foolish talk, it may rebuke him; and if
               he wander forth towards deceit, it may turn him back into the path; and if he act
               contemptuously, it may remind him of authority; and if he act scornfully, it may
               remind him of the instructor; for these things a life of fear accompanieth not, for
               it wandereth among all wickedness.</p>
            <p>For every one who hath need to learn fear is necessary to remind him of his
               instruction, for without fear instruction is not perfected, or if it be perfected
               without it, it is not acceptable, and if it be accepted without it, it is not
               preserved. And <persName>the prophet of God</persName> reproacheth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n181-1"/> severely those who have
               broken the yoke, and cut the bands of the fear of God, and again, in another
               place<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n181-2"/> he heapeth contumely upon <placeName>Israel</placeName> who had slipped his shoulder from
               [under] the yoke of the divine commandments: <quote>As an ox which hath escaped from the
               yoke, so have the children of <placeName>Israel</placeName> escaped, they and their kings and their
               nobles.</quote> Now <placeName>Israel</placeName> became rebels because there was no fear [in them]; and they
               trod under foot the commandments because they were not mindful of what was
               threatened; and they despised the law because they remembered not the penalty of Him
               that ordained it. For He Who ordained the law because He knew to whom He was giving
               the law, against [the breaking of] His commandments multiplied His threats in His
               wisdom, so that although freewill might hold the law in contempt, <pb n="182"/>the
               fear which followed thereafter might incite [<placeName>Israel</placeName>] to the keeping thereof. And
               because he that received the law became a rebellious slave, He made him to labour in
               bondage in the fear of tribulation. Before his face He displayed all the various
               forms of punishment, so that as long <pb type="external" n="189"/>as he looked
               thereupon he might take heed to the commandments, and keep the law.</p>
            <p>Let us then study to fix the fear of God in our mind, and let us meditate thereupon
               by day and by night. If the fire of lust kindleth in us, let us set in opposition
               thereto the fire of <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n182-1"/> If greediness of the belly seize upon us, let
               us remember the worm which dieth not.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n182-2"/> If the beauty of the face excite us,
               let us remember the outer darkness.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n182-3"/> If the love of mammon fight against us,
               let us call to mind our own unworthiness. If human benefits stir us, let us be afraid
               lest we lose the kingdom which abideth for ever. If wrath attacketh us with its
               violent onset, let us look at the threat of God against those who provoke to wrath.
               If vainglory raise a tumult within us, let us bring up in our minds the disgrace and
               contempt [which we shall feel] before our Judge. By fear let us make fear of none
               effect, and by death let us vanquish death.</p>
            <p>And together with these things, whosoever wisheth to keep his life with all diligence
               from sin hath need of the perpetual remembrance of death; for whosoever is
               continually mindful of the day of his <pb n="183"/>departure, and who at all seasons
               meditateth upon the hour of his death doth not easily march on to iniquity, and doth
               not dare to draw nigh unto the work of sin. The remembrance of death drieth up all
               lusts, and the sight of the remembrance of death scattereth all the wickedness which
               is gathered together against the soul, and all the lusts which are drawn up against
               the body. Let the death which is near be unto us a teacher against the death of
               <placeName>Gehenna</placeName>, and let us keep <pb type="external" n="190"/>our life on all sides with
               watchfulness, let us remember God and fear His judgment, and let us keep His
               commandments, that being pure from all vices, and our persons being adorned with all
               virtues, we may be worthy to enjoy the heavenly delights with all the saints, and
               that, together with them, we may praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost for ever,
               Amen.</p>
