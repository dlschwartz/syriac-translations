            <head type="title">The Seventh Discourse: which sheweth that all the righteous men of old fulfilled the
               commandments of God in the fear of God.</head>
            <p>The way of the rule and conduct of the Christian life hath been trodden and made
               smooth by the example of the righteous men of old for whomsoever wisheth to travel
               rightly therein, and the marks of the footsteps of those who have before gone
               thereupon are before us, that we ourselves may go forward therein with ease. And like
               the sign-posts and mile-stones which are set by the side of a natural road that they
               may define the place wherein the passers-by are to travel, so also do the examples
               and types of the men of old, and the divine commandment and law encompass the way in
               which we are to travel, and they limit the passage of our footsteps within them, so
               that no man may venture to stray to the right hand or to the left. For like as we are
               obliged not to stray on either side of the plain path of truth, that we may not
               wander in deceit, and be tripped up in our faith, so also let us not go forth, either
               to one side or the other, from the lawful way of the divine course of life which hath
               been delivered unto us, but as in the way of faith, <pb type="external" n="192"/>let
               us travel rightly along this fair path. And let us know the beginning, and the end,
               and the middle, and let us look closely at the many steps, so that we, <pb n="185"
               />one step after another, in fitting order, may mount this ladder which leadeth up to
               heaven. Now the Dweller in heaven shewed this ladder aforetime, as in a mystery, to
               the elect of the Fathers, the blessed <persName>Jacob</persName>;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n185-1"/> and also that those who went
               up and those who came down upon it were angels. And that that ladder belongeth not to
               heavenly angels alone, the word of the Book indicateth to us, because the angels of
               God were going up and coming down thereupon; for every man who draweth nigh to
               enquire thereat, and who beginneth to mount it, laboureth after the order of angels,
               and is numbered among the elect of spiritual beings, and he hath inscribed his name
               as a heavenly soldier. And as the children of men who receive human positions, and
               who labour in some one of the grades of the world, change the name of <quote>rustics,</quote> by
               which they were formerly called, to <quote>servants</quote> (or soldiers), so also the man who of
               his own freewill enrolleth himself in the company which Christ hath formed, and who
               serveth in the army of spiritual beings, the word of the Book nameth him <quote>angel,</quote> and
               not <quote>man,</quote> and rightly so, because he hath begun the service of angels, and he is
               bound to receive their name. And he is called <quote>angel</quote> instead of <quote>man</quote> because of his
               service and manner of life, and not because of his nature. And moreover upon the
               ladder, <persName>Jacob</persName> the upright saw angels ascending and descending; those who were
               ascending were men, <pb type="external" n="193"/>because it belongeth unto men to
               ascend from earth to heaven, and those who were descending were angels, because their
               country is heaven, and they descend from their country, the heights above, to the <pb
                  n="186"/>earth. Now therefore angels and the children of men were mingled upon
               that ladder that the Holy Book might teach us that a fair life is common both to
               spiritual and corporeal beings, and that the keeping of the commandments is
               obligatory to both of them. And the children of men keep the commandments when they
               are exalted from the depth to the height by the steps of the commandments, and the
               angels minister unto the wishes of [the Divine] Majesty when they are sent below from
               above. For those who are to inherit life, that is to say, those who are of the body
               in their nature and are inferior beings, the service of the commandments maketh
               celestial and spiritual beings; and the command of the Creator urgeth those who are
               celestial and spiritual by creation to go down to the country of terrestrial beings,
               and to abide continually with corporeal beings, so that from races which are
               different from each other, one Church may be gathered together in the bond of love,
               which will sing the services of God's will, and which will be wholly and entirely
               moved by one living and spiritual motion, even as the natural body is moved entirely
               by the life of the soul.</p>
            <p>Now therefore it appeareth to us from the word of the Book, that this ladder which
               goeth up to heaven is made of many steps, and that it must be ascended by these steps
               one after another, in proper order, even as those who have ascended this ladder
               before us have delivered unto us. <pb type="external" n="194"/>For we ourselves have
               shewn that the first step is faith, and the second simplicity, which is the pure
               motion of nature, and which although faith be produced therefrom, also protecteth
               faith. For as craftiness is the destroyer of faith, even so are simplicity and
               innocence the things which establish <pb n="187"/>faith, from the simplicity of which
               the fear of God also is produced; because fear is closely united to simplicity
               naturally. Now the simple are afraid, but the crafty despise us; the simple quake at
               the sound of correction, but the crafty prepare a place to which they may flee. And
               as fear followeth in the train of natural simplicity, and it inciteth it concerning
               all doctrine, and it stirreth it up to receive learning and instruction, even so is
               the fear of God closely united to the simplicity of the soul, and it inciteth it to
               keep the commandments and to fulfil the laws, and not to despise and to hold in
               contempt the things which have been delivered unto us by the word of God. And fear
               leadeth man until [he hath acquired] discretion, and until the righteousness of the
               Judge is revealed to him, and it teacheth him that he is bound to keep the
               commandments; trembling and terror of Him that ordained the law, hold fast for the
               disciple so that he may keep vigilantly the laws which have been given to him. And
               when the righteousness which is in Him hath been revealed, and this virtue which hath
               been placed naturally within his soul hath risen upon it, it demandeth from him <pb
                  type="external" n="195"/>that like a man who is in debt, he should pay his debt,
               which consisteth in the keeping of the commandments. For as do the creditors of
               [this] world towards those who are in debt—now they press and compel them to pay what
               they owe—even so doth the justice which is in our soul compel us to pay to God the
               debt of His commandments, for the fear which followeth in the train of simplicity
               bringeth us to this state, and by this fear all the men of old pleased [God].</p>
            <p>It is necessary that whosoever occupieth the position of a servant should fear, for
               fear should follow <pb n="188"/>after service in every form; but there is in the love
               which is not perfect, fear, for the Holy Book saith, <quote>In perfect love there is no
               fear.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n188-1"/> So then after the man who beginneth with love and is not yet perfect,
               fear followeth. One man feareth lest he be struck, and this is the fear of slaves;
               another man feareth lest he suffer loss, and this is the fear of hirelings; another
               man feareth lest he cause distress, and this is the fear of friends; and another man
               feareth lest his name be not handed down to posterity, and this is the fear [of lack]
               of children. Now although the name of fear is one, yet many different kinds [of fear]
               are found therein. There is the fear of God which the holy Prophets had, [and there
               is the fear] which the nation of the Jews had from time to time, but the forms of
               that fear were different; the Prophets, like friends, feared <pb type="external"
                  n="196"/>to cause distress to God, Whom they loved, but the Jews, like slaves,
               were afraid of the rod of His chastisement. And that He might increase in them this
               fear, immediately, by the mouth of offence, the rod of His chastisement was revealed,
               and after the offence the Chastiser gave them no respite, because their servitude was
               not worthy of His longsuffering. Above their head the rod of justice hung
               continually, and immediately they committed sin they were chastened, and at the time
               of their offence they were beaten, and at the entrance of the path of their sins they
               forthwith received rebuke; for longsuffering teacheth the foolish servant contempt,
               and in order that that stupid nation, which in the manner of an evil-doing servant,
               sat in the house of God, might not [learn] contempt, the <pb n="189"/>Chastiser took
               away longsuffering, especially when they went forth from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. And we must also
               understand the object of that swift punishment in another way, and that there was not
               longsuffering as regardeth the correction of their sins; for God the Teacher took the
               people, like a child, from <placeName>Egypt</placeName> their nurse, that He might deliver unto them the
               doctrine of His knowledge, and might teach them the instruction of His wisdom. But
               the people, in their ignorance, when instruction had been delivered unto them, forgot
               it, and they never kept in remembrance the meditation of the commandments of God, and
               they were frequently punished with severity, so that, if it were only through fear of
               chastisement, they might lay hold upon the remembrance of <pb type="external" n="197"
               />instruction. The man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath day was stoned by all the
               congregation;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189-1"/> and the earth opened and swallowed up others who were called
               by <persName>Moses</persName>, and who scorned him and came not<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189-2"/>; and fire went forth suddenly,
               and burnt up the bodies of others who thought lightly of his priestly office, and who
               sought honour for themselves;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189-3"/> and others, who in the guise of paying honour,
               brought strange fire out of season, were burnt up by a tongue of fire which went
               forth from the tabernacle, and they perished;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189-4"/> and others, because they asked
               for flesh and rejected the bread of angels, were tortured by the indigestion which
               came upon them;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189-5"/> and others who went astray as concerning the calf, were
               pierced through by the swords of the Levites;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n189-6"/> and others, who were the cause
               of <pb n="190"/>the revolt at the waters of trial were set apart for
               destruction;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n190-1"/> and others who murmured against the Lord perished by fiendish
               snakes;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n190-2"/> and likewise they all, because they strove against going into the
               land of promise, came to an end and were destroyed in the wilderness. To these
               offences, then, these punishments were united, and together with each act of
               wickedness a punishment straightway sprang up by its side, so that evil deeds might
               be suppressed by stripes, and sins by vengeance, and so that the people might be like
               a child who feareth the teacher who giveth him instruction, and that it might tremble
               before the Judge who would beat them like a wrongdoing slave.</p>
            <p>And for this reason <persName>Moses</persName> also, the schoolmaster of the people, in all places
               commanded the people to fear God, saying, Do such and such things, keep the
               commandments, fulfil the laws, love thy companion, <pb type="external" n="198"/>visit
               the poor who are with thee, thou shalt not treat thy brother with violence, thou
               shalt covet nothing which belongeth to thy neighbour, honour thy father and thy
               mother, thou shalt not swear falsely in the name of the Lord, thou shalt not go
               through the boundary of thy neighbour, thou shalt neither spoil nor oppress, thou
               shalt not act with violence towards him that is more feeble than thou; and at the end
               of each of the commandments he reminded them, saying, <quote>Fear thy God.</quote> And <persName>Moses</persName> the
               teacher bade them take heed that the fear of God might be in them, because he knew
               that the commandments could [only] be kept by fear, and that the fear of God [only]
               could drive the people from iniquity. </p>
            <pb n="191"/>
            <p>That the people should love God was the greatest of the commandments, and therefore
               <persName>Moses</persName> urged them to fear Him. The commandment, <quote>[Thou shalt] love the Lord thy God
               with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n191-1"/> belonged
               to those who were righteous among them; but those who were like slaves, and who like
               slaves were committing offences at all times, he commanded to fear God, for fear
               repulseth vices, and love perfecteth virtues. Fear cutteth off the path of iniquitous
               men, and love urgeth on the way of the virtues. <quote>Fear God,</quote> and <quote>Love the Lord thy
               God;</quote> these two commands were ordained in the law which was given to the people, so
               that whosoever became exalted above the command of fear might find before him the
               command of love, which is perfected therefrom. For this reason <persName>Paul</persName> also, when he
               was shewing the difference between us and them, said concerning the discipleship of
               <persName>Christ</persName>, <quote>For ye have not received the spirit <pb type="external" n="199"/>of
               servitude again unto fear</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n191-2"/>—that is to say, ye have not been called to be
               slaves, that fear might be born to you out of servitude—<quote>but ye have been invited to
               adoption,</quote> which is perfected in love in all good things.</p>
            <p>Well therefore doth fear accompany simplicity, and this is rightly required for the
               beginning of discipleship; for as long as fear abideth with the learner continually
               it remindeth him not to forget his instruction. And as <persName>Moses</persName> gave commandments
               concerning fear to those who had newly set out in the way of the discipleship <pb
                  n="192"/>of God, so also now it is meet that fear should accompany every disciple
               who setteth out in the way of righteousness. Whosoever feareth despiseth not, and is
               not negligent, and is not contemptuous, for fear stirreth him up to keep the
               commandments; and if it happen that he cometh to contempt, the remembrance of fear
               suddenly maketh him stupid. For immediately a man remembereth God, if it be that the
               remembrance of Him hath been accurately depicted in his soul, he is greatly moved and
               troubled, and he is filled with fear and trembling, and stupefaction rusheth upon him
               suddenly because of his former contempt; even as saith the holy <persName>Prophet</persName> who knew
               how to fear God, and who had felt what things the fear of God worketh in the soul, <quote>I
               remembered God, and I was troubled.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n192-1"/> And behold the remembrance of God
               should not be one of trouble; O holy <persName>Prophet</persName>, and why wast thou troubled at the
               remembrance of Him? And why did the beloved remembrance of Him clothe thee with
               trembling? <pb type="external" n="200"/><quote>Because I have sinned against Him, and I
               remembered mine offences,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n192-2"/> and I became mindful of the Judge, and I was
               filled with fear; I considered my sins and His vengeance, and the remembrance of Him
               troubled me. Whosoever fixeth his heart, trusteth in God, and he maketh his heart
               firm and feareth not.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n192-3"/>. The heart which is fixed in virtues the remembrance
               of God maketh to be glad, and whosoever hath obtained healing of spirit in his inner
               man, the remembrance of God maketh to rejoice. Wheresoever the conscience is pricked
               by sin, there doth fear, the remembrance of <pb n="193"/>the Judge, dwell; for the
               offender who remembereth the Judge is troubled, and the evildoer is filled with
               trembling at the remembrance of punishment. It was for this reason that <persName>the Prophet</persName>
               said, <quote>At the remembrance of God I am troubled. I meditate and my spirit is
               overwhelmed. Giddiness hath seized my eyes; I am silent and I speak not. I have
               considered the days of old, and I have remembered the years which are past. I have
               meditated in the night season, and I have communed with my heart, and examined my
               spirit, and said, Hath the Lord forgotten me for ever? Will He be favourable unto me
               no more?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n193-1"/> With such thoughts as these did the <persName>prophet of God</persName> keep watch,
               and he prayed upon the cushions of his bed as in the church of the saints, being
               mindful of the things which he was bound to pay back to God. And he considered the
               days and the generations which had gone by, and he considered how each of the
               righteous men [of old] had in his time pleased God, and how and with what manner of
               life he had been victorious before Him. And these things which <persName>the Prophet</persName> called
               to remembrance were [intended] to make all those who were to come after him to
               remember, and to teach every man to fear God in this same manner, and <pb
                  type="external" n="201"/>[to teach] that a man himself should reckon with himself,
               and should consider also other men who were before him, and how they led their lives
               in all watchfulness.</p>
            <p>Now the Prophet, moreover, said that he had done two things: <quote>I have considered the
               days of old, and I have called to mind the years which are past in which the men of
               old pleased God,</quote> and through the <pb n="194"/>remembrance of these two things <quote>I am
               filled with fear at the way in which the righteous men pleased God, and at the way in
               which I have provoked [Him] to wrath. I have given my seasons to reckoning, and my
               hours to counting, I have meditated upon the days which have passed, and upon the
               years which I have lived in the world. I have considered with what I have provoked
               Him, and what sins I have committed, the things in which I have sinned in act, and
               the things [in which I have sinned] in thought, and the things [in which I have
               sinned] with [my] hearing and with [my] tongue. And when I meditated upon these
               things I said, Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight can no man
               living be justified.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n194-1"/> To such resemblance doth the word of <persName>the Prophet</persName>
               call us, and he delivered unto us this type of instruction. We must reckon the hours
               and the seasons, and in what we have provoked [Him], and the things upon which we
               have meditated; for if those who practise the trafficking of [this] world reckon up
               their income and expenses each day, and what they gain and what they lose, how much
               more is the spiritual merchant who goeth forth in quest of heavenly riches bound to
               do this? And the reckoning of these things benefiteth a man in two ways; firstly, he
               collecteth his mind to reckon, and secondly, he is zealous in collecting his money.
               It is therefore a terrible thing for a man to provoke God, especially when he
               considereth carefully His Majesty, and His immeasurable love and what good things He
               hath poured out in abundance upon our race, <pb type="external" n="202"/>and what His
               grace hath given unto us, which <pb n="195"/>by our own works we were not worthy to
               receive. And when a man considereth within himself, who he is, and how the things
               which are with him have come, and Who is the giver of them, it is right that he
               should remember God, and be troubled, even as <persName>the Prophet</persName> taught him. For it is
               fitting that we should fear God for two reasons, either because we have sinned, or
               that we may not sin; for whosoever remembereth the offences which have already been
               committed [by him], and considereth his former sins, must fear the vengeance due to
               his evil deeds, and whosoever thinketh that he is pure, and that he hath no offences
               [committed] in days gone by which he may reckon, and at the memory of which he may be
               troubled, let him be afraid lest he grieve God in the things which are to come. And
               thus also did the righteous men [of old] guard their lives from sin, and they healed
               the wounds which had come [to them], and against those which had not yet come they
               were watchful; for the first blow which a man receiveth teacheth him to avoid being
               struck again, and the pain of a first sickness urgeth him to be watchful against the
               suffering of a second.</p>
            <p>What man can contemplate God with vigilant thought, and look upon His majesty, and
               consider His hidden nature, and can with the eye of his understanding look upon that
               pure and holy Nature, Which hath need of nothing; Whose country and dwellingplace are
               exalted; in Whom all riches, and good things and treasures are gathered together; Who
               is wholly and entirely light, and life, and pleasure; Who is forgiving, and merciful,
               and good; Who is gracious, and compassionate, and full of love; <pb type="external"
                  n="203"/>Who is beautiful, and lovely, and to be desired; Who beggeth, and
               entreateth, and urgeth every <pb n="196"/>man to live; Who is afflicted for the sake
               of our life, and seeketh to find us, and is more pleased at our happiness than we
               ourselves; Who continually entreateth us to take from His riches and to carry off
               wealth from His storehouse, that we may be rich through His treasures, and not
               poverty-stricken; Who rejoiceth not in His life as in ours; Who because our poverty
               was not able to ascend to His riches, brought His riches down to our poverty; Who
               because He saw that we desired not to become rich, made Himself a beggar that He
               might make us rich; Whose name is beloved, and Whose appellation is much desired, and
               Whose remembrance is sweet; Who maketh the soul which perceiveth Him to taste of the
               sweetness of the spirit; Who liveth in splendour in the rich wealth of His Being,
               Whom no man hath seen, neither is he able to see Him; Whose nature is unspeakable,
               and Whose riches cannot be explained; Whose gifts also are like unto Himself, and,
               like Him, are beyond the limit of knowledge; Who is as good as we are bad, and Whose
               grace is more abundant than our wickedness; Whose nature only is the measure of His
               grace, and by it only can His love be measured; Whose grace is extended, Whose
               justice is contracted; Whose love is large, Whose vengeance is small; Who is ready to
               forgive, and slow to rebuke; Whose punishments are few, and Whose gifts are many;
               Who, although He correcteth us, beareth remission of sins for us, and Who, because He
               loveth to gain us, for that reason chastiseth us; Him in Whom there is no loss,
               except only that we have become lost, and Whom affliction striketh not except <pb
                  type="external" n="204"/>for our sake; Who put on our passions that He might cast
               away our passions from us, and Who clothed <pb n="197"/>Himself in our sickness that
               He might bring our diseases to nought; Who was afflicted to make us rejoice, and Who
               suffered grief that He might fill us with rejoicing; Who made Himself to be in need
               of everything that we might lack nothing; Who, knowing that we should become
               provokers to wrath, created our nature like that of beloved children who had need of
               Him; Who, knowing that we should enroll ourselves as servants of devils, inscribed us
               heirs of both His worlds; Who, considering aforetime our likeness, and that the image
               of the will of Satan was sculptured upon it, carved and depicted us in His desirable
               likeness; Who, perceiving that we kept not the things of ancient time, made ready
               aforetime for us others which were greater; He the rich Giver Whose only loss was
               that we would take nothing from Him; Who while He was giving gifts unto us, grace was
               receiving us ourselves, and while we were taking from His treasure, we were laid up
               in His treasury as if we were treasure; Who loveth mankind, and is at all times the
               Good Being, and the Doer of good; Who being pure and untroubled worketh in us by His
               doctrine that He may make us pure like unto Himself; Who, being rich and Who being
               incapable of being brought to poverty, planneth devices whereby He may flatter us to
               take of His riches, and become rich; Who, having gotten wealth, feigneth Himself to
               be poor, and when we have gotten wealth, He feigneth that He hath become rich through
               us; Who, without us, desireth to possess nothing, and if He acquireth anything
               without us, He is as one Who rejoiceth not therein; <pb type="external" n="205"/>Who
               considereth our joy His, and our affliction His, and Who accounteth all our losses
               His own; Who hath given unto us all good things, and is not satisfied, and <pb
                  n="198"/>Who hath poured out upon us all riches, and was not satisfied until He,
               in His love, gave Himself for us? </p>
            <p>Who then would not be afraid to grieve this rich and good Being, Who is lavish in
               giving, sweet and gracious, providing and sustaining, indulgent and forgiving,
               merciful and full of love, rich, and making rich, good, and doing good, longsuffering
               and peaceful, loving our race, and accounting our nature beloved, our Physician and
               Teacher, our Father by His grace, and our foster-parent in His graciousness? And who
               would not tremble to provoke Him to wrath? And what man, who should consider all
               these good things which have been given to us, and who should look at the majesty of
               their Giver, would not be troubled in his mind whenever he remembered Him? And what
               soul having received all these gifts would not be shamefaced before the Giver
               thereof? For it is a fearful thing that man should not be afraid of God, and that
               mortal beings should not be put to shame by all this love, and that those who receive
               all this wealth of good things should not feel shame; for these things, and others
               like unto them, the <persName>Prophet [David]</persName> remembered, and was therefore troubled. And
               every one, who possesseth the watchfulness of that holy soul, will at the remembrance
               of this God also be troubled like the Prophet, and in his going in, and coming out,
               and in all his actions, will be greatly moved at the remembrance of Him.</p>
            <pb type="external" n="206"/>
            <p>Whosoever feareth sleepeth not, and if he sleepeth, he seeth in his dream the cause
               of his fear; he eateth not, and he drinketh not, and if the force of natural craving
               compel him, fear is mingled with his meat and drink. Everything which attacketh the
               man who is filled with the fear of God abideth outside <pb n="199"/>him, for fear
               keepeth fast hold upon the place of his understanding, and upon all the places of
               ingoing and outgoing of the city of his soul. Like the watchmen who stand by the
               gates of the city, even so doth fear keep fast hold upon the places of ingoing and
               outgoing of the soul, and it permitteth no act or thought to enter in or to go forth
               which it examineth not; for it neither permitteth any internal thought whatsoever to
               go forth, nor any external act that is not seemly to go in. And moreover this
               <persName>Prophet</persName> maketh known in other places the fear of God; <quote>My flesh contracteth through
               fear of Thee, and I am afraid of Thy judgments.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199-1"/> And again he saith, <quote>I am
               like a wine skin in ice, but I have not forgotten Thy commandments.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199-2"/> And
               again he saith, <quote>Sorrow is in my heart all the day long. How long, O Lord, wilt thou
               turn Thy face from me? How long wilt Thou forget me, for ever? How long wilt Thou set
               trouble in my soul?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199-3"/> And again he saith, <quote>Heal me, O Lord, for my bones
               tremble, and my soul is greatly moved. I am weary with my groaning; <pb
                  type="external" n="207"/>every night make I my bed to swim; and I water my couch
               with my tears. Mine eye hath become sick because of Thine anger;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199-4"/> now it is
               evident that all these things arose from [his] fear of God. And again he saith, <quote>I
               roared by reason of the groaning of my heart;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199-5"/> and again he saith, <quote>Lead me,
               O Lord, in Thy fear and righteousness;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n199-6"/> and again he saith, <quote>There is no
               soundness in my flesh before the fear of Thee, and there is no health in my bones in
               the presence of my sins. For my iniquities <pb n="200"/>have gone over my head; and
               [they are] as a heavy burden heavy upon me. My wounds stink and are corrupt, and in
               the presence of my iniquities I tremble greatly. All the day long I walk in sadness.
               For my ankles are filled with trembling. I am much moved, and I am brought to great
               misery.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-1"/> And again he saith, <quote>My heart is turned back, and my strength hath
               forsaken me; and the light of my eyes is no longer with me.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-2"/> And again he
               saith, <quote>I kept silent, and I was sorrowful, and I was afflicted even from good; and
               my sickness was stirred. My heart became hot within me; and in my body the fire
               kindled.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-3"/> And again he saith, <quote>I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth;
               because Thou didst it. I have come to an end because of [Thy] rebuke of my
               sins.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-4"/> And again, in another place, he ascribeth blessedness to the man who
               feareth God, and he maketh known what good things the fear of God worketh in him that
               feareth [Him], saying, <quote>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-5"/> and here
               the fearer of God is accounted blessed. And although our Lord ordained blessings for
               other things, <persName>the prophet David</persName> accounted blessed the fearer of the Lord. <pb
                  type="external" n="208"/><quote>Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the way of the
               wicked,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-6"/> and it is well known that he walketh not in the way of the wicked
               because he feareth God. And again he saith, <quote>Blessed is the man whom Thou shalt
               correct, O Lord, and whom Thou shalt teach Thy law,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n200-7"/> and it is manifest that
               the fear of God teacheth <pb n="201"/>the laws, and that the man who feareth
               confesseth his correction. And again he said, <quote>Blessed are those who are without
               blemish in the way, and who walk in the law of the Lord,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n201-1"/> and here again the
               fear of the Lord preserveth [a man] from blemishes, and urgeth him to walk in the way
               of the law. And again he saith, <quote>Blessed is the man whose iniquity is forgiven, and
               whose sins are covered,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n201-2"/> and it is well known that here also the fear of God
               bringeth to repentance, through which the forgiveness of sins is given, and through
               the suffering and tears which are produced by the fear of God the form of a man's
               sins is covered before his eyes. And again he saith, <quote>Blessed is every one that
               feareth the Lord, and who walketh in His ways,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n201-3"/> and here again <persName>the prophet
               David</persName> sheweth that a man walketh in the way of the commandments through the fear of
               God. And in another place he saith concerning him that feareth the Lord, <quote>He taketh
               heed to the commandments which are given by the Lord.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n201-4"/> And again this
               <persName>Prophet</persName> counselleth every man to draw nigh unto God in fear, and he entreated all
               creation to fear the Lord Who made it, saying, <quote>Let all the earth fear the Lord, <pb
                  type="external" n="209"/>and let all the inhabitants of the world tremble before
               Him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n201-5"/> For the word of the prophecy casteth fear and trembling upon all the
               inhabitants of the world, and it teacheth all created beings to come to God by this
               way.</p>
            <p>Whosoever feeleth his state of bondage is bound to fear the power which hath subdued
               him, and hence <pb n="202"/>it is right for every created being who hath in him
               discernment to perceive his Creator, to draw nigh to Him in fear and trembling; for
               that we should fear God is seemly for our nature, but that we should love Him is
               given unto us by His grace. For man is not worthy to love God, but God Himself came
               down that He might be loved by man. Now creation is bound to fear God naturally, but
               if it be exalted to the grade of love it is not its nature which is able to lift it
               up there, but Grace goeth down in search of it, and bringeth it up and stablisheth it
               in the height of divine love, that it may, by Grace, love God, Whom justly it is
               obliged to fear. And behold, moreover, to the kings and princes of [this] world not
               every man hath power either to shew love, or to reveal to them the most ardent and
               faithful emotions of affection; but all ranks and orders who are under their
               subjection must shew fear and service before them, and not the confidence of
               affection and love. For according to the custom of exalted rank which is found with
               the governors of [this] world, to be loved by inferiors (or the poor) is considered
               by them a disgrace, and therefore, they demand fear from every man, in their capacity
               of lords, <pb type="external" n="210"/>and not love like parents. Now God, having in
               His Grace ordained Himself our Father, gave unto us also power to love Him, and it is
               not right that we should of our own freewill exalt ourselves insolently, but we
               should remain the whole time of our life in the subjection of His fear, and when He
               Himself wisheth His Grace will exalt us to the grade of His love. To our mind the
               capacity of loving God belongeth not, but the capacity with which we were created is
               to fear God, and therefore the Holy Books <pb n="203"/>everywhere demand from the
               children of men fear rather than love, inasmuch as circumspection accompanieth fear
               and confidence love. And, moreover, love is the cause of fear, for until a man
               plougheth, and toileth, and soweth the seed in fear, he cannot arrive at the reaping
               of love. For as the crops of the husbandmen of [this] world are in the hands of God,
               while the ploughing and the sowing belong to our own will, even so are the labours
               and the service of fear placed in our will, but that we should arrive at the capacity
               for love, and gather in the produce thereof belongeth to the will of God. For until
               the manifestation of <persName>Christ</persName>—Who brought love to the world—fear ministered in the
               world to all the children of men, and until <persName>Christ</persName> was revealed to man in his own
               place, it was right that all his life should be passed in the perpetual service of
               fear; and although our Creator hath, in His Grace, called us <quote>sons</quote> to make us proud
               and to magnify us, yet is it more seemly for us to abide in the fear of servants. <pb
                  type="external" n="211"/>And that we were called <quote>sons</quote> belongeth not to
               ourselves, but to the Grace of Him that called us, and it belongeth not to us to ask
               for wages boldly, but to us it belongeth to serve in fear; but that one should give
               the wages of love belongeth to God. And no man will offend if he calleth love the
               wages of fear, for as a man receiveth [his] wages after his toil, even so after the
               service of fear doth <persName>Jesus</persName> make us taste the sweetness of His love, from which joy
               ariseth for us, and we stand in the confidence of sons, and our hidden man findeth
               freedom of speech with God, and our understanding stablisheth joy of spirit at all
               seasons, and our mind delighteth inwardly in the sight of heavenly light, and
               contempt for everything which is visible is <pb n="204"/>born in the soul, and our
               dwelling is as if it were already in the kingdom which is prepared for the
               saints.</p>
            <p>Now these and such like things hath the soul that hath tasted divine love, for the
               man who standeth in perfect love is in God, and what happiness compareth with this,
               or what pleasure or delight is equal to that of a man being in God? for the position
               which is in perfect love is purity from all wickedness, and the perfection of all
               virtues. And also <persName>Jesus</persName> was not persuaded to give this wealth of love except to the
               man whom He <choice><sic>know</sic><corr>knows</corr></choice> to be worthy of it, for from love is born confidence, and
               to confidence contempt is closely united, and there is no virtue which hath not near
               it a breach through which it can be ravished. But in fear there is no <pb
                  type="external" n="212"/>contempt, only watchfulness and circumspection, and a
               perpetual guard which preserveth the good things from the ravisher; for the fear
               which is of God urgeth a man to gather together the things which are profitable, and
               when they have been gathered together fear also increaseth and multiplieth to him
               that gathereth them, for it turneth and addeth to his fear, and he taketh good heed
               to his virtues that they be not spoiled. He crieth out because he is afraid, and he
               is watchful of his possessions because he feareth lest they be ravished, and in every
               respect it is necessary and advantageous to life in [this] world that a man should
               fear God. The country of fear is the country of the life which is mortal, and the
               country of love is the other world of the life which is immortal. Let us consider
               then our country, and let us increase in us fear, and let us look at the dwelling in
               which we live, and let us increase in us trembling at God, and at the remembrance of
               the report of Him; and let us rouse ourselves as from <pb n="205"/>the depth of deep
               slumber, and let us wake up wholly to keep all His commandments. For the nature of
               the fear of God is that it urgeth us [to do] one thing, and one thing only, for it
               stirreth us up to do all the commandments, and for this reason the Spirit of God
               desired to teach us the fear of God by the hand of all the Prophets. And <persName>the Prophet
               David</persName> himself said, <quote>All those who pass over the earth shall fear the Lord, and all
               those who go down into the dust shall kneel [before Him].</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n205-1"/> And again he
               saith, <quote>Lead me, O Lord, in Thy fear and righteousness,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n205-2"/> and because he knew
               what the profit of the fear of God was, he asked it as a gift from God. <pb
                  type="external" n="213"/>For all the conversation of the soul which the fear of
               God leadeth standeth in righteousness. And again, when he entreated God not to
               remember the sins of his youth<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n205-3"/> against him, he was moved to make this
               request by His fear of God; and again he said, <quote>The fear of the Lord is the beginning
               of wisdom.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n205-4"/></p>
            <p>Now the end of the path of good works is spiritual love, therefore from love divine
               wisdom is produced, and the blessed <persName>David</persName> well taught us that the beginning of this
               way of wisdom is the fear of God. For as to every matter in [this] world there is a
               beginning and an end, and as the paths which are trodden down naturally by the
               passage of footsteps have also a beginning and an end, even so hath the path of
               virtue a beginning and an end; its beginning is the fear of God, and its end is the
               wisdom which is born of love. And it is right that every man who wisheth to begin the
               Christian life should begin <pb n="206"/>it with the fear of God, even according to
               the teaching of the blessed <persName>David</persName>; and again another Prophet said, <quote>The fear of the
               Lord shall open [my] ears for me;</quote> and concerning <persName>Jonah</persName> it is also written, <quote>He
               feared before the Lord and fled to <placeName>Joppa</placeName>.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n206-1"/> For although his fear was born
               of simplicity, yet like a man who feared God he fled in order that he might not draw
               nigh to the work which he thought was too hard for his strength. And again when he
               was asked by the sailors whence he came, and what <pb type="external" n="214"/>God he
               served, he said, <quote>I fear the Lord, the God of heaven.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n206-2"/> And also when those
               who were with him in the ship saw the marvellous things which took place through God
               in the sea—for the sea rose up, like a being having intelligence, to demand from them
               the fugitive servant, and when he had been given unto it, it sank to rest and its
               billows were quieted—and saw through the things which took place the fear of God, it
               is written concerning them that <quote>the men feared the Lord, and they offered up
               sacrifices unto the Lord, and vowed vows.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n206-3"/></p>
            <p>And again God demanded from the Jews the fear of Himself by the hand of <persName>Jeremiah</persName>,
               and reproached them by the testimony of the dumb things in nature, which, though
               silent, trembled at the fear of Him, while the Jews despised His commandments. <quote>Fear
               ye not Me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at My presence? For I have placed the
               sand for the bound of the sea, [by] an everlasting law, and it shall not pass over
               it.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n206-4"/> And here again the Creator demanded fear and trembling from created
               things, and because they forsook His <pb n="207"/>fear they were reproached through
               the dumb things of nature, which feared and trembled at the Majesty of the Creator,
               while His commandments were despised by the children of men. And God in all places
               shewed the majesty of His nature by the hand of the Prophet, that He might cast the
               fear thereof into those who listened. For to those who would have despised His
               meekness—if it had been shewn unto them—He revealed the majesty of His nature that
               they might tremble thereat; and to others He shewed His gentleness and meekness, <pb
                  type="external" n="215"/>which at the report of His humiliation would increase
               [their] love [for Him]. Now the fool is wont to despise whosoever is humble before
               him, but the wise man loveth him more because of his humility. For the fool hath no
               eye to see love in humility, and for this reason greatness is made manifest to him,
               and indignation is written down for him, and severity and terror are inscribed before
               him, that by reason of these he may fear the more Him Who maketh such things
               manifest. And the Will of God hath, according to the following testimony, revealed
               why He maketh use of these words to the children of men. <quote>The sea is obedient unto
               Me, and restraineth the fury of its waves within the despicable bound of sand. And
               its waves lift themselves up, and pass not over the contemptible fence which hedgeth
               them in; but ye of your own freewill despise this terrible God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n207-1"/> And again
               in another place He maketh known that He employeth every kind of benefit and help
               towards them, and that He took and brought nigh unto them every cause for fear and
               love, but that they would neither fear nor love Him. <quote>If I be Lord, where are those
                  <pb n="208"/>who fear Me? And if I be Father, why do ye not honour Me?</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n208-1"/>
               therefore they should either have feared [Him] as Lord, or have honoured [Him] as
               Father. And for this reason also God in a certain place<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n208-1"/> repeateth before him
               the benefits which He had wrought for the people— the terrible Exodus from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>,
               the abundant gifts in the wilderness, the entrance into the land of promise, <pb
                  type="external" n="216"/>the subjugation of foreign nations, the benefits which
               were poured out abundantly upon their lives every day—so that He might rouse them up
               to love the Giver. And in another place<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n208-2"/> He repeated the great things which
               He had done, and the works which He had established by the nod of His Will, and how
               all created things hang upon the power of His word, and the natural things keep their
               bounds, and the creation is yoked beneath the dispensation of His Will; before Whom
               the mountains are placed in scales, and the hills in a balance, Who hath meted out
               heaven with His span, and hath comprehended the dust of the earth in His palm, and
               before Whom the nations and peoples of the world are accounted as nothing. These
               things He spake by the hand of <persName>the Prophet</persName>, that through them He might make His
               majesty known, and that by the report of His majesty he might work fear in those who
               listened unto him. For when God spake unto those who were in the condition of
               servants, He rehearsed before them the great and terrible things of His nature, but
               when [He spake] to those who were accounted by Him worthy of the grade of love, He
               set forth the doctrine of humility, and of love, and of meekness, and He humbled
               Himself and spake to them <pb n="209"/>because they did not despise Him in His lowly
               estate, but rather loved Him the more because of it. For where God cannot confide in
               the children of men because of their immature understanding and childish knowledge,
               He speaketh terrible and fearful things, and He granteth not unto them boldness to
               draw nigh unto the confidence of His love, lest, when they have perceived His
               knowledge and forgiveness, and above all things that love and grace are to be found
               with Him, for this very reason they despise <pb type="external" n="217"/>His
               graciousness, and they cast themselves after the manner of the flesh to the working
               of all vices. And this is manifest alone to those who have obtained the inheritance
               of the name of sons, together with that of grace also, through the labour of their
               works, for in proportion as they feel love, they love the more; and in proportion as
               they perceive the goodness of the nature of God, they become better men; and in
               proportion as His condescension and graciousness become revealed unto them, they are
               themselves urged to become like unto their Father in things which are like unto
               these.</p>
            <p>And for this reason all the revelations of God in olden time belonged to fear, but
               this latter [revelation] is of friendship and love; for in times of old He revealed
               Himself to teach us that He was our God, but in this last time He hath appeared and
               shewn us that He is our Father. In times of old He drew nigh to the children of men
               who were in the condition of slaves, but to-day He calleth them to the inheritance of
               <quote>sons.</quote> And when He revealed Himself to gather together slaves unto Himself, He bore
               stripes and fetters, blows and chastisements, punishments and penalties, fear and
               trembling, indignation and cruelty, <pb n="210"/>swift vengeance, the rod which was
               always stretched out over the head of sinners, the open judgment hall, and the judge
               who was ready; but in times of old was reared up the wood that the blasphemer might
               be crucified upon it, of old the stones were collected for stoning, of old the fire
               was kindled for the burning, of old the stripes were made ready for crimes, of old
               the instruments were prepared to take tooth for tooth, of old were the eyes bored
               out, of old the branding irons were ready to avenge, of old <pb type="external"
                  n="218"/>blows were struck, of old sentences<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n210-1"/> of judgment upon crimes were
               passed. To those who were slaves belonged such stripes. And that the wicked slave
               might not raise his head, and lift up himself insolently against the Giver of the
               law, He broke his legs that he might not kick, He cut off his hands that he might not
               strike a blow, He drew out his teeth that he might not bite, He put out his eyes that
               he might not see and desire the things which belonged not to him, He inflicted injury
               upon him that he might not injure others, and by the fear of punishments He drove
               back the vices of that nation because it would not be persuaded to be restrained from
               its abominable practices through fear of Him. For where there is the fear of God, man
               hath no need of the fear of these and such like things, because the fear of the
               unseen Judge sufficeth to draw him from all his vices. Lay fast hold then, O
               disciple, upon this fear in thy soul, and fear nought else, for the fear which is of
               God feareth not the world, and the fear which is of the world feareth not God. Let us
               then be afraid <pb n="211"/>at all times lest we provoke God to wrath, because the
               portion of fear is placed in thee that thou mayest fear God therewith. In [this]
               world there is nothing which belongeth to fear for the soul that perceiveth the fear
               of God, and the trembling of afflictions is accounted nothing to the man who hath in
               him the trembling of the fear of the righteousness of God. Our Lord abrogated one
               fear, and established another; He lifted from us the fear of the death which
               belongeth to time, and He laid upon us <pb type="external" n="219"/>the fear of the
               death which is for eternity. <quote>Fear ye not the death [which is of time],</quote> but fear the
               death [which is for eternity]. <quote>Let not those who kill the body terrify you, but fear
               ye Him Who can destroy the soul and the body.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n211-1"/> Those who kill [the body] are
               not to be feared, for Another quickeneth, but He is to be feared Who is able to put
               to death so that there is none who can quicken, and when He hath killed, there is
               none who can bring to life. For that which is transitory the fear thereof also is
               transitory, but the fear of Him Who neither passeth away nor changeth cometh not to
               an end. <quote>He looketh upon the earth, and it trembleth, He rebuketh the mountains, and
               they smoke.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n211-2"/> And again [the Book] saith, <quote>At Thy rebuke they flee, and at
               the voice of Thy thunders they are afraid.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n211-3"/></p>
            <p>And behold, according to the word of <persName>the Prophet</persName>, the fear of the Creator also
               resteth upon the natures which are speechless, because each of them is bound
               naturally to be afraid of Him; and if dumb things fear Him, how much more should
               intelligent beings fear <pb n="212"/>Him? The fire which belongeth to time is greatly
               feared by the children of men, yet how remote from the mind is the remembrance of the
               fire which [burneth] for eternity! The sight of the tortures which can be seen is
               terrible and appalling, yet how very far removed from the vision of the soul are the
               punishments which are to come! The death which is here is full of terror, and yet the
               image of everlasting death is not set before our eyes. Immediately the remembrance of
               the things which are written entereth in, it annulleth from the heart the remembrance
               of the things which are here; and so long as our minds are not moved by the constant
               fear of God, every fear which cometh upon us terrifieth us. <pb type="external"
                  n="220"/>For so long as the king is absent the judge is held in fear, but when the
               king appeareth in his power the fear of judges is annulled, and not is this so only,
               but the judge himself, together with all the grades [of men] beneath him, is subject
               unto the fear of the royal power, and those who are feared themselves become people
               who fear. For all fears gathered together are smitten by one fear, and all princes
               and governors, from whom fear descendeth upon the grades [of men] beneath them, are
               obedient and subject unto one fear which is the mistress of all others. Of One only
               let us be afraid, and through the fear of Him the power of all [other] fears shall be
               dissolved, and let the trembling which is produced by all [other] powers be brought
               to nought, and let every governor bow his head before one Royal Governor Who ruleth
               over all. Thus likewise when the fear of God is remote from the soul, it is afraid of
               everything, of powers, of judges, of governors, of men of rank, of captains of hosts,
               of rich men, of those in authority, of despised and common folk, <pb n="213"/>and of
               men of low and contemptible condition; and together with these it feareth also
               affliction, and injuries, and punishments, and torments, and pains, and sicknesses,
               and loss, and poverty, and remoteness from kinsfolk, and removal from family, and
               deprivation of friends, and departure from [its] native country. All these and other
               similar things are [objects of] fear to the man who feareth not God, but if the fear
               of God enter in and dwell <pb type="external" n="221"/>within the country of the
               soul, and lay hold upon all the members of its thoughts, it is henceforth impossible
               for the soul to receive [any] other fear; and when any fear which goeth to dwell
               therein seeth that the fear of God abideth in the soul, it will leave [it] and
               depart, because its house is not capable of receiving another inhabitant. For as a
               vessel which is full of one substance cannot receive any other which may be put
               therein, unless it be emptied of that which first filled it, even so the soul which
               is filled with the fear of God cannot receive the fear of the world, or the fear of
               anything which is in the world, for it is wholly occupied by that one true fear of
               God. Let us all then strive to possess this fear, and let us despise [all] else, and
               let us be empty of everything, that we may be sufficient for the one work only of the
               fear of God; and in the remembrance of His terrible and venerable Name let us keep
               our lives with all diligence, and let us make glory to ascend to the Father, and to
               the Son, and to the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here endeth the Seventh Discourse: which is on the fear of God which was in the
