            <head type="title">The Second Discourse: Which teacheth which is which is the First Commandment that the
               man who draweth nigh to the discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName> should lay hold upon.</head>
            <p>Whosoever wisheth to draw nigh in systematic order to the life and conduct of the
               discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName> before all things it is meet that he should within himself
               lay hold upon sure faith, which maketh certain that God is, and enquireth not; which
               holdeth His words to be sure; and seeketh not to investigate His nature; which
               hearkeneth to His words, and judgeth not His deeds and actions. For faith maketh
               [man] believe God in everything that He speaketh without requiring testimonies and
               proofs of the certainty of His word, the certain proof that it is God Who speaketh
               being sufficient for him. Signs and testimonies and proofs are demanded when it is
               man who doeth or sayeth anything, but when it is God Himself who speaketh, and the
               Lord of the universe Who sayeth that He will perform [it], it is necessary for us to
               believe, it being sufficient for the persuading of our faith that it is God Himself
               Who speaketh and will perform. And man hath not the power to judge His will; for how
               can <pb type="external" n="27"/>man who hath been made judge the will of Him that
               created him? For as the vessel cannot chide the handicraftsman and [ask] why he hath
               thus formed it, <pb n="24"/>or judge any of his works, so also is it with man who is
               a rational vessel, and he hath no power to chide with the Workman Who made him. And
               although man possesseth the speech of knowledge it was not given to him to judge the
               will of Him that made him, but that he might be a panegyrist of the knowledge which
               formed him; for the rational man is farther removed from the power of scrutinizing
               His Creator, than is the speechless vessel from the power of criticising him that
               made it. For the giving of thanks have we received speech from God our Creator, and
               in order that we may admire His created things hath He placed in us thoughts of
               knowledge. That we may perceive Him He hath made us to possess a sense of wisdom, and
               that we may receive a foretaste of His gracious acts hath He placed within our soul
               the sense of discernment. That we may see Him in His works He hath given to us the
               eye of faith which can see deeply into His secret things. God is too great to be
               investigated by the thoughts, and His dispensation surpasseth the seeking out of
               speech. And with His nature go also His works: for as His nature is inscrutable so
               also the deeds and actions of His nature cannot be sought out. And His will and wish
               cannot be judged, either for what reason hath He willed thus, or for what reason hath
               He done thus; for as He cannot be judged by us as to why He hath made us in this
               form, and why He hath formed us, and placed us in the world in this order of
               constitution, so also none of His wishes can be found fault with by us, either as to
               why He willed thus, <pb type="external" n="28"/>or why He performed.</p>
            <p><quote>He that would draw nigh to God is bound to believe that He is, and [that] to those
               who seek Him He <pb n="25"/>will be a rewarder;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n25-1"/> this law hath <persName>Paul</persName>
               committed to the man who wisheth to draw nigh to God, and this obligation of
               rewarding [him] is laid upon God. He must believe only that God is, and whosoever
               believeth that He is, from what time and in what manner [He existeth] he will not
               enquire. So also is it with His will, if he heareth [it], and His word, and His
               doctrine; that it is the will of God Himself he will be sure, and the voice and
               commandment of God he will hearken unto and believe. That he should judge why, and in
               what form, and for what reason [He is] thus is the insolent investigation of the soul
               which hath not perceived God.</p>
            <p>It is meet for every man that would draw nigh to God that he should possess the mind
               of a child; and as a child is towards his father and mother, so should he be towards
               God and towards His dispensation. And as the child receiveth instruction from his
               master without searching into his words or examining his doctrine, and without
               judging in his thoughts that which he teacheth him—for he hath not sufficient ability
               in his own thoughts to be a judge of what he heareth—so also is it meet for the man
               to be towards God, neither enquiring into Him with his words, nor judging His deeds
               and actions in secret thoughts; for he is a child, and like a child he should incline
               his ear unto His instruction, and receive it with faith. And it was also for this
               reason that God gave birth to us a second time, that He might teach us that we were
               children <pb type="external" n="29"/>and infants of the world born unto faith, for
               the womb which gave us birth—that is, <pb n="26"/>baptism in which the Spirit is
               mingled—has been made the means. Now we have been born in faith, and as the natural
               child who is born from the womb existeth wholly in natural simplicity and knoweth
               nothing of the world, and seeketh not to know, and enquireth not, and thinketh not,
               and speaketh not, except that he moveth only with the living motions of nature, being
               remote from all power of the mind, so also this child, of the Spirit, who hath been
               brought forth by the womb of baptism instead of by the natural womb, is not bound to
               enquire concerning Him that <choice><sic>begot</sic><corr>begat</corr></choice> him while he listeneth to His words with
               sincerity, and he should become like a child to His doctrine, accepting [His]
               commands and drawing not nigh to enquire into them. And as that natural child
               learneth the names of the things of the world without understanding their power, so
               also let [the child of the Spirit] accept the names and words, and God shall give him
               the secret of understanding them. For in respect of that knowledge we are children
               and infants compared to the unspeakable wisdom of God, and thus also are we called by
               the word of our <persName>Redeemer</persName>, [Who said], <quote>Suffer little children to come unto Me, and
               restrain them not, for of those who are like these is the kingdom of God</quote>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26-1"/>
               And again in another place He said, <quote>Whosoever will not receive the kingdom of God
               like a little child shall not enter into it.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n26-2"/></p>
            <p>For as is the faith of little children in respect of the things of [this] world, so
               is it meet <pb type="external" n="30"/>that our faith should be towards the words
               which are spoken to us by God, because thus is also the child <pb n="27"/>towards the
               word which he heareth from his father, and everything which is promised to him by him
               he believeth without doubt that he will give him and that he will not fail in his
               word, and he doth not question him; he doth not first make investigations concerning
               it, and test its power, and attack its trustworthiness, and then accept it. And if
               the thing which hath been promised unto him be too great for the power of his father
               [to perform] he knoweth not how to distinguish it, but everything which he saith to
               him he accepteth from him directly and doubteth not. And if he seeth purple raiment
               upon a king's son, or the crown which is placed upon his head, he asketh his father
               to give them to him, and he believeth in the sincerity of his mind that he will give
               them to him, for concerning him he thinketh that he is able to do everything. And if
               he seeth a snake or a scorpion he doth not hesitate to stretch out his hand towards
               them in his simplicity, and he biddeth his father or his mother to give them to him,
               and he also maketh known the desire of his simplicity by his weeping [if they give
               them not to him]; and his constant importunity concerning them, and his cries, and
               his tears, testify that he asketh [for them] with all the power of his nature,
               believing that the power of his father is able to resist the injuries of the harmful
               reptile, and he hath no doubt whatever in his soul that that which he desireth can be
               given to him. Therefore after this type of children did our <persName>Lord</persName> command that all
               those who would receive His kingdom should become, believing and holding to be sure
               the promises of God unto them like children. For our <persName>Lord</persName> proclaimed and revealed
               His kingdom to corporeal beings, and said, <pb type="external" n="31"/><quote>Repent ye,
               for the <pb n="28"/>kingdom of heaven hath drawn nigh.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n28-1"/> Thou hast heard the
               voice of him that proclaimed concerning His kingdom, believe it then undoubtingly,
               especially since thou hast learned that it is the voice of God. Meditate not in thy
               soul how this kingdom can be, and try not to search out these spiritual countries in
               thy imagination; take not upon thyself the customary habit of the thoughts of the
               body when thou hearest of incorporeal, countries, and fashion not imaginary forms out
               of thy heart concerning these glorious mansions which the Ascension of <persName>the Son</persName> hath
               prepared [for thee]; and think not to order in thy knowledge that which the knowledge
               of God hath fashioned aforetime. Thou wast not called to search out the kingdom,
               neither its preparation nor construction, but only to be an heir and a guest, that
               thou mightest enjoy thyself out of the overflowing abundance of its spiritual
               delights. Thou hast heard the word concerning the kingdom which <persName>Jesus</persName> speaketh to
               thee, <quote>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven hath drawn nigh;</quote> to thee He hath said,
               <quote>Repent,</quote> and not that thou shouldst be one who should try to examine into the
               kingdom, for that is near unto thee if thou wilt draw nigh unto it. Now the drawing
               nigh unto the kingdom cannot be arrived at by the questionings of these words which
               enquire, <quote>How, and in what manner, and what the kingdom is like;</quote> but let each of us
               keep the laws of the kingdom, and perform the commandments which have been committed
               unto us by the Ruler of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>All these things by faith thou hast heard concerning God, that He is from everlasting
                  <pb type="external" n="32"/>and world <pb n="29"/>without end, and that He
               existeth in His own being, and that He hath not come into being from any other
               substance; and that He is not One Person, but a Nature, existing of Itself, which is
               believed and confessed in Three Persons. And moreover, the word of faith teacheth
               thee to be certain concerning the Persons, that He Who <choice><sic>begot</sic><corr>begat</corr></choice> cannot be
               divided, and that He Who was born cannot be separated,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n29-1"/> but the Father
               together with His <persName>Son</persName> is everlastingly and eternally of like nature with the Holy
               Spirit. That they exist is all that thou [needest] to confess. How, and from what
               time, or in what manner, and to what limit, and with what form and order, and what is
               their likeness, and how they can be Three not being divided from each other, and how
               it is that since they are in each other they are called Three, and how the <persName>Son</persName> can
               have been born since He hath not been separated from the Father, and how the Father
               <choice><sic>begot</sic><corr>begat</corr></choice> him since He hath not gone forth from Him, and how it is that having
               been in existence from everlasting and world without end they are not described as
               Three Beings—these things and others which are like unto them are accepted by faith,
               and without faith man is not able to hear them [and believe them]. Even the ordinary
               hearing is not able to bear them unless faith be found to precede them and to accept
               them.</p>
            <p>And thus also is it in respect of the spiritual natures and orders of celestial
               beings, and it is faith which maketh it possible to receive every word which is
               spoken concerning them; <pb type="external" n="33"/>for otherwise there must
               necessarily be unbelief, since the Book calleth them <pb n="30"/><quote>absolute spiritual
                  beings</quote> [in one place], and in another it speaketh of them as <quote>compacted bodies,</quote> to
               which it attributeth forms which are different from each other. Concerning the
               Seraphim<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-1"/> we are told by the word of the Book [that they have] wings and
               faces, and concerning the Cherubim<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-2"/> [we are told that they have] other forms
               which are different from each other; which of these statements are we to accept as
               true? for according to the outward hearing of the word each contradicts the other.
               The statement that they are spirits we believe, the statement that they are compacted
               bodies we hold to be true, the statement that their construction consisteth of forms
               of different kinds we accept; and we receive them all by faith, because it hath been
               said by God that their [four] sides were <quote>living animals</quote> [which] were <quote>full of eyes
               as they turned round.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-3"/> And by this word He hath taught us that the whole of
               the spiritual nature can see, and that all of it can hear, and that all of it can
               perceive, and that all of it can think, and that all of it can put things to the
               test,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n30-4"/> and that all of it can understand, and that all of it can desire with
               the desire of its nature; and it doth not hear with one member and not with another,
               or see with one and not with another, but the whole of it is hearing, and the whole
               of it is seeing, and everything which it is that it is wholly. And its hearing is not
               disturbed by its vision when with the member with which it heareth it [also] seeth,
               or when with that with which it thinketh it also tasteth; and we believe them to be
               undisturbed and undestroyed by each other. </p>
            <pb n="31"/>
            <p>Now in respect of compacted bodily natures which have been discovered to be the
               opposites of these spiritual beings, in that they hear with one [member], and see
               with another, and taste with another, and smell with another, and feel with another,
               and think with another, contrary to the constitution of their members the movement of
               their passions maketh division; <pb type="external" n="34"/>but above, with these
               spiritual natures, each one of them is wholly and entirely one thing in all his
               motions, and his members—head, and feet, and hands, and face, and back, and front,
               and length, and breadth, and colour, and forms which are different from each
               other—are not separated. For in these natures there is not the composition of these
               members, and it happeneth not that because there is no eye there is no vision of the
               eye, or that because there is no ear there is no hearing of the ear, or that because
               there is no bodily palate they have no [power of] tasting spiritual things, or that
               because they have no wings they cannot fly, or that because they have no legs they
               cannot move about, or that because they have none of the members of the heart they
               cannot think; but they possess all the service of the members, although they have no
               compacted members. And how the operation of the members is established without the
               members themselves we have no power in our own knowledge to understand; but by this
               [power] which is given to us by God, I mean faith, we understand these things, and
               although they do not at all fall under the investigation of the human thoughts they
               are accepted by us without any doubt. For from faith we learn this [fact] that they
               exist, and not they only, but also the Being Who existeth of Himself, their Creator,
               by faith we accept that He is.</p>
            <pb n="32"/>
            <p>The stablishing of all our instruction (or doctrine) is in faith, for although the
               appearance and march of things teacheth and maketh understanding men wise concerning
                  <pb type="external" n="35"/>their Creator, yet faith should precede even this, for
               behold, because there was no faith this became a lie unto many. And to speak briefly,
               everything which is of the spirit, and the whole world of spiritual beings, faith
               seeth and faith perceiveth. If we do not take faith within our soul we shall
               understand nothing outside of that which can be seen. To [understand] these things
               which are seen faith is unnecessary because the vision of the eye seeth them, for
               they are corporeal in their nature, and man looketh at them corporeally; but the
               whole world of the spirit is perceived by faith, and it seems as if that world could
               not exist if there were no faith.</p>
            <p>Observe then how great is the power of faith, for all the spiritual things which are
               would, without it, be as if they existed not; and not only living works or spiritual
               countries, but that Being which is, would be, if we had no faith, as if He existed
               not. For this reason <persName>Paul</persName> looked upon the mystery of our doctrine, and said, <quote>He
                  that would draw nigh to God is bound to believe that He<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n32-1"/> is;</quote> he commanded the
               disciple [first] to take faith upon himself, and then to draw nigh to the
               discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName>. For <persName>Paul</persName> knew that the spiritual nature could not fall
               under the bodily senses, and that it could not be known, for not even one of the
               bodily senses <pb type="external" n="36"/>could subjugate it, and for this reason he
               commanded us in his doctrine to believe only that He is. Now the Creator divided the
               whole <pb n="33"/>of the corporeal nature into five kinds; one may be seen, another
               may be heard, another may be smelled, another may be perceived, and another may be
               touched; and He gave to man five senses with which he might be sensible of the world
               in its multitudinous varieties. Therefore, outside these five senses which I have
               enumerated a man can neither perceive anything of the corporeal world, nor doth the
               world exist to him outside these senses. And the remainder of everything which is
               spiritual, whether it be that which existeth of itself or whether it be things which
               are created, cannot be subjected to one of these five forms, neither can it be
               experienced by [any] one of these five senses. And for this reason also when our Lord
               gave us this blessing of perceiving Him, He delivered unto us first of all faith,
               with which we might perceive Him, and then He revealed to us concerning Himself, and
               for this reason the blessed <persName>Paul</persName> said<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33-1"/> that <quote>Faith [cometh] from the hearing
                  of the ear, and the hearing of the ear from the word of God.</quote> By the hearing of the
               word of God <persName>Paul</persName> taught us to receive faith, and although faith hath been implanted
               in our construction by God our Creator, yet hath it been corrupted and changed from
               faith to error, and after the manner of that natural wisdom which hath also been
               given to us in our construction we have changed it, and instead of the wisdom of God
               we have gathered together the wisdom of [this] world with it. And something else
               which is external to God through the wisdom of God have we changed, <pb
                  type="external" n="37"/>even as <persName>Paul</persName> saith, <quote>Through the wisdom of God the world
               knew not the wisdom of God.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n33-2"/> </p>
            <pb n="34"/>
            <p>And thus also hath the natural faith which is in us been turned into error, and these
               things which have been given to us by the Creator for [our] advantage have been found
               by us to be a loss, for we have changed their profitable orderings, and we have made
               use of them in a manner other than that for which they were designed. Our faith hath
               believed in what is unseemly, and our wisdom hath made acquaintance, with what is not
               befitting; for where faith was unnecessary there have we made use of faith. For what
               the eye of the body saw, and what all the bodily senses perceived, that thing was
               understood to be something else by our faith, and we expected one thing in the place
               of another. And because of all this the ordering of the faith which was implanted in
               us by the Creator hath been destroyed, the word of God hath been implanted in us a
               second time, and the power which is in us hath been stirred up by the doctrine of
               <persName>Christ</persName>; for this reason He urgeth with all His words, high and low, that faith
               should be in us, saying, <quote>Verily I say unto you if there be in you faith like a grain
               of mustard seed ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence; and it shall remove; and
               nothing shall be too difficult for you.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n34-1"/></p>
            <p>He taught us by faith that nothing should be too difficult for us, and according to
               this everything can be overcome by the power of faith, according to the command (or
               decision) of the word of <persName>Christ</persName>. For by faith signs took place, and wonderful deeds
               were wrought, and mighty works were completed, <pb type="external" n="38"/>and things
               worthy of admiration were accomplished. <pb n="35"/>Everything which is above nature
               faith alone performeth, whether it be the raising of the dead, or the healing of the
               sick, or the curing of those who are smitten with disease, or the cleansing of
               lepers, or the opening of the eyes of the blind, or the making the lame to walk, or
               the making sound and stablishing of all the other members of the body, or the making
               to speak those having impediments, or the making the deaf to hear, or the driving
               away of devils: all these faith perfecteth. By faith a mountain removeth from its
               place, by faith the sea and rivers have been crossed on foot, and by the power of
               faith all natural things have been obedient to the voice of man. And to speak
               briefly, faith giveth the power of God to man, for when he hath once believed,
               everything that he wisheth he doeth by the power of faith. Faith changeth feebleness
               of the body into its own mightiness, and the despicable order of man it maketh into
               the audible command of God. Faith looketh upon something which existeth not as if it
               were something which doth exist, and that which existeth it accounteth as if it
               existed not. And this also is an example of the power of God, concerning Whom <persName>Paul</persName>
               spake, <quote>He calleth the things that are not as though they were.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35-1"/> And the
               <persName>Prophet</persName> said, <quote>He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
               rivers;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35-2"/> and again, <quote>He looketh on the earth and it trembleth; He rebuketh
               the mountains, and they smoke.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35-3"/> And again the prophet <persName>Isaiah</persName> saith, <pb
                  type="external" n="39"/><quote>All the nations are accounted as nothing by Him.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n35-4"/>
               Now these things the Spirit of God spake <pb n="36"/>concerning the power of God,
               that those things which were not He called to come into existence, and that what did
               exist He called and changed into nothing. To this power also He compareth faith, not
               only in that matter of [the working] of signs and wonderful things, in that the
               things which are not it worketh after the manner of God, and those which are it
               bringeth to an end and finisheth by the power of God, but also in that those things
               which, because of their being hidden, were accounted as if they existed not, were
               perceived by it as if they were manifest, and those which are, and in which we
               labour, and by which we are ministered unto, are accounted as if they existed not,
               for [faith] saw aforetime their dissolution. And although their nature was not to
               pass away, it made them pass away; and although they existed, it dissolved them; and
               although they were visible, they were to it invisible; and although their delights
               could be experienced, they were as nothing to it; and although all created things
               were to run, to faith they would be at rest. When it seeth death it maketh not sure
               that it is death, and riches are accounted poverty by it, and everything which is in
               the world or is even of the nature of the world it looketh upon as if it existed not,
               because its course is about to be annulled, and its affairs to cease. The things
               which are remote and afar off, it bringeth and placeth near in front of it, and it
               looketh upon them face to face; and without a covering (or <choice><sic>vail</sic><corr>veil</corr></choice>) it looketh
               upon all secret things and regardeth all things that are hidden. To the sight <pb
                  type="external" n="40"/>of the body the kingdom of heaven is afar off, yet the eye
               of faith regardeth it; these mansions in the house of the Father, which are remote
               according to the body, hath <pb n="37"/>faith already dwelt in. That spiritual light
               shineth in its country gloriously, and faith hath already walked therein and gazed
               upon it. The apparel of our glory is in heaven, but faith hath already put it on. Our
               spiritual riches and possessions are there, and our faith receiveth therefrom and
               giveth away. Our true city is in heaven, and faith henceforth dwelleth therein. Our
               race, and family, and parents are in that country, and faith speaketh with them, and
               is in conversation with them always. The table of our happiness is there set, and
               faith rejoiceth thereat continually. The spring of life from which we drink there
               floweth, and faith at all times drinketh therefrom. The powers of life and ranks of
               light are in the country of life, and faith glorieth with them.</p>
            <p>And why should I speak concerning things which, although they be glorious, are
               externals, and although they be mighty and worthy of wonder, have been newly
               constituted? If they are remote from us now by reason of their hiddenness, yet are we
               about to draw nigh unto them when we have become [beings] of the spirit according to
               the ordering of their country. And what shall we say concerning these things?
               Wherever is the self-existent Nature of God, Who is remote and afar off from
               everything, He is near to faith; and however remote He may be He is not remote from
               it; and however far off He may be He is not far off from it; and although He be away
               beyond everything <pb type="external" n="41"/>yet is He near to faith; and although
               He be within all rational things and inarticulate things, and in things which have
               life and in things which feel not, wherever He may be, there is faith with Him. For
               this is the nature of the vision of faith; <pb n="38"/>what cannot be seen it seeth;
               what cannot be known it knoweth; what cannot be perceived it perceiveth; and what is
               illimitably afar off it seeth and becometh nigh thereunto. And however minute, and
               concealed, and hidden, and spiritual, and exalted, and unutterable be that natural
               thing which faith seeketh to see, the more triumphant is its vision of it. Now on
               those things which are very great faith is wont to seize and show her [power] of
               investigation, for it is accounted by her a disgrace to remain with small things, and
               to be held back to created things, and therefore she passeth through everything and
               is detained by nothing, except by the Creator. The capacity of creatures is not able
               to bear and to grasp the power of faith, for not one of them can believe therein, and
               if it believeth therein [it thinketh] that faith is a created thing, and not that it
               is self-existent; now the trial thereof can only be made in God; for it casteth
               everything away and setteth all natural things upon one side, and doth itself draw
               nigh to the Creator. For faith maketh to pass away the things which now exist, and it
               bringeth on those which are about to come into existence. Faith is the tongue of God,
               and faith is the command of the Creator. Faith commandeth, and like God it is obeyed
               in every thing; <pb type="external" n="42"/>it beckoneth, and all creation respondeth
               to it. And the power of God is the power of faith, because the power of faith is
               derived from God. Faith is the mistress of created things, and as a mistress who
               giveth orders to her handmaids and is obeyed by them, even so faith commandeth all
               creation, and it obeyeth her. And it is a marvellous thing that not only are created
               things obedient unto faith, but even the Creator Himself resisteth <pb n="39"/>not
               her will; whatsoever she seeketh she receiveth, and whatsoever she asketh from Him He
               giveth to her, and [when] she calleth to Him He answereth her.</p>
            <p>The door of the Giver is opened to the petitions of faith, even as He said,
               <quote>Whatsoever ye shall ask, not being doubtful, ye shall receive.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39-1"/> In the house
               of God faith giveth her commands like a mistress of wealth and a ruler of
               possessions. The mystery of faith is a wonderful and exalted thing, and no man is
               able to fathom its mystery; and it is so great that it is a place of habitation for
               God. Faith is that which is not a name only, nor is it even voice or speech; but it
               is that which sheweth itself by the true examination of the soul, and by the sure and
               certain stability of the thoughts, and it denieth not itself, but in this respect
               also it is to be compared with God, concerning Whom <persName>Paul</persName> saith, <quote>He cannot deny
               Himself.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n39-2"/> Thus also is it with the faith which denieth not itself, which
               bringeth not doubt upon itself, upon which no suspicion falleth, and whose power fear
               reacheth not. Everything that it wisheth, it doeth, and whatsoever it seeketh is
               given unto it.</p>
            <pb type="external" n="43"/>
            <p>The man who would draw nigh unto God is bound to lay hold upon faith in his soul, for
               faith hath no thoughts which dissolve one the other, neither hath it opinions which
               annul each other. Faith retracteth not what it doeth and sayeth, and it blameth not
               itself when once it hath spoken and asked for what it desireth. And as in God there
               can be no repentance concerning anything which He doeth and speaketh, even so there
               ariseth no repentance in faith concerning <pb n="40"/>whatsoever it doeth, so that in
               this respect it is to be likened unto God. Faith is a command, and its command
               ruleth; it prayeth with confidence, and according to its confidence its prayer is
               straightway perfected into works. There are instances in which faith doth not even
               offer up prayer and then give a command concerning something; but it speaketh with
               authority like unto God. And as there is nothing which is able to resist the command
               of God, so also can nothing resist the command of faith. There are instances in which
               faith prayeth and in which it revealeth itself in its prayer; and there are instances
               in which while it prayeth not it giveth the command authoritatively, and it is
               answered. <persName>Elijah</persName> did not pray before <persName>Ahab</persName> and then was heard, but the faith which
               was in him gave the command authoritatively, and what he commanded immediately stood
               firm. And his word had more power over all natures and created things than the
               command of a king concerning the provinces of his dominion. <quote>As the Lord, the mighty
               One, liveth, before Whom I stand this day, there shall not be rain or dew these three
               years until I speak.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n40-1"/> It is not written that he prayed [first], and then
               spake, but immediately creation heard his word it bowed itself under the nod of his
               command. <pb type="external" n="44"/>All things hearkened unto the command of a
               mortal man as if it had been the word of God. The clouds were obedient unto him, he
               called the earth and it answered him, he commanded the air, and it did not appear in
               its variable forms. All creation became a submissive handmaid before the word of
               <persName>Elijah's</persName> faith, and, although disturbed by the <pb n="41"/>command which her
               mistress had spoken to her, [nevertheless] ministered thereunto.</p>
            <p>And in another place, concerning the captains of the hosts who went up to bring him
               down with the others who were with them, it is written that he commanded and spake
               with Godlike authority, and the fire of God came down from heaven and burnt them all
               up. <quote>If I be a prophet, as thou sayest, let fire come down from heaven and consume
               thee and the fifty who are with thee,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41-1"/> and straightway and without delay, the
               fire descended from heaven upon the unclean, and it burnt into them as it came down,
               and to the word of the prophet there was actual fulfilment.</p>
            <p>Now in other places it is written that faith prayed and was afterwards heard,
               according to that which is written, <quote>And he bowed himself, and put his face between
                  his knees, and he sent his disciple to look by the way of the sea</quote>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41-2"/> And again
               when he raised the widow's son, he prayed, and prostrated himself,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41-3"/> and then
               raised him. And in this prayer also faith made its appearance. For if he had not
               believed that he could raise him, he would not have taken the boy from his mother,
               and have carried him up [to his chamber] and have cast him upon the bed. And again
               also he commanded his disciple <pb type="external" n="45"/>with authority, saying,
               <quote>Ask whatsoever thou wishest, and I will give it to thee before I am taken from
               thee;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n41-4"/> and according to what the disciple asked and the master commanded, the
               Spirit ministered in very deed, and bestowed the gift upon <persName>Elisha</persName>.</p>
            <p>Now when he was offering up sacrifices on <placeName>Mount Carmel</placeName> <pb n="42"/>in the sight of
               <persName>Ahab</persName> and of all <placeName>Israel</placeName>, <quote>Answer me, Lord, answer me, Lord,</quote> he cried out, <quote>that
               all this people may know that thou art the Lord, and that I am Thy servant, and that
               I have done everything by Thy command;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42-1"/> and until he had prayed he was not
               answered and no fire came down. And the reason why in one case they prayed, and in
               another gave commands with authority is manifest; in the one their feebleness was
               apparent, and in the other the power of God towards them was revealed. For while they
               were praying and making entreaty they appeared like the feeble children of men; but
               while they were giving commands and being obeyed without prayer, it was recognized
               that it was the power of God which was with their command. In the one place they
               spoke like children of men, and in the other like the servants of God, that is to say
               like gods of flesh, for the faith which was in them made them heavenly gods. And in
               this respect also they are to be compared to <persName>Christ God</persName>, who in some cases wrought
               things like a Being of power, and in others He [first] entreated and afterwards
               worked. He did not raise <persName>Lazarus</persName> until He had prayed;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42-2"/> He did not bless the
               bread and distribute it to the multitudes until He had looked up to heaven;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42-3"/>
               and He did not give the command for the ears of the deaf man to be opened until He
               had spit, and laid His fingers upon his ears, <pb type="external" n="46"/>and looked
               up to heaven.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n42-4"/> Others, however, He healed by a command of power, without
               either looking up to heaven or asking His Father. For by a command of power He raised
                  <pb n="43"/>up the young man, the son of the widow;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-1"/> with a word He called
               to the daughter of the chief of the congregation and straightway she stood
               up;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-2"/> He commanded the sea<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-3"/> and it was silent, and the wind and it was
               stilled; He spake<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-4"/> only, <quote>Fill the water pots with water and draw out and bear
               to the governor of the feast,</quote> and created matter delayed not [to do] His will. <quote>I
               say unto thee,</quote> He spake to the dumb spirit,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-5"/> and immediately it departed from
               the man. <quote>I will, be thou clean,</quote> He spake to the leper,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-6"/> and as He willed,
               straightway the leprosy fled from his body.</p>
            <p>For in this manner <persName>Jesus</persName> also wrought marvellous things, so that He might also
               bring Himself down to those whom, by His grace, He called, His <quote>brethren</quote>; and that
               it might not be grievous unto them that they were not answered until they had prayed
               He humbled Himself and prayed, and was afterwards answered. For the <persName>Lord</persName> took upon
               Himself equality with His servants in order that that which is written might be
               fulfilled, <quote>In everything it was meet that He should be like unto His
               brethren.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n43-7"/> He gave unto them dominion that they might speak with authority,
               and be answered, so that by this they might be known to be the servants of God; and
               He gave boldness to faith that it might do everything that it wished. Thus also with
               power did <persName>Joshua, the son of <persName>Nun</persName></persName>, command the sun and the moon, and they were
               restrained, <pb type="external" n="47"/>and each of them stood still in its course.
               <persName>Joshua</persName> stretched out his hand and <pb n="44"/>spake<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44-1"/> with the power of
               faith, saying, <quote>Thou sun, tarry in <placeName>Gibeon</placeName>, and thou moon, in the valley of
               <placeName>Ajalon</placeName>;</quote> and the sun was restrained, and the moon stood until the people had taken
               vengeance upon its enemies.</p>
            <p>And why should I speak concerning the prophets [only] in the case of a nation in the
               whole of which—together with women and children—faith showed forth such mighty
               triumphs as these? For faith, as it had been commanded, cried out, and the
               walls<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44-2"/> [of <placeName>Jericho</placeName>] were not able to stand against its voice. In every place
               faith manifested such triumphs as these, and it worked marvellous things in all the
               Holy Books. He that hath perceived the power of faith, and hath had experience
               thereof in very deed, knoweth that it wrought these things, and he believeth also
               that it doeth [still] such things as these.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O thou who wishest to become a disciple of God, do thou also get faith,
               the mistress of all possessions. Let this thing be to thee the beginning of thy
               instruction, and lay it as the foundation of the building of thy tower, in such a way
               that if it were to seize the height of heaven it would not fall, for the edifice of
               faith is its foundation, which cannot be shaken by waves and winds. And <persName>Jesus</persName> also
               set this faith [as] a foundation by the hand of <persName>Simon</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n44-3"/> and as our <persName>Lord</persName>
               made it the beginning, so also is it meet that the disciple, who would draw nigh to
               discipleship in systematic order, should first of all begin with it. Faith <persName>Jesus</persName>
               made the foundation of the whole Church, do thou also lay the foundation for thine
               own rule and manner of life therewith. He built thereupon excellent rules <pb n="45"
               />of life and conduct for the whole world, and do thou <pb type="external" n="48"
               />build upon it thine own triumphs and order of life. He laid it out as a foundation
               for all the generations of the world after His coming, and do thou make it the
               beginning of thy life which is in God. See then how great faith is, in that it is
               sufficient to bear all children of men!</p>
            <p>And <persName>Jesus</persName> also made faith the foundation of the edifice of the Church because He
               saw aforetime its invincible might, its unconquerable assurance, its
               never-diminishing strength, its irreproachable triumph, its power which cannot be
               overthrown, its unenfeebled strength, its irresistible command, its decree of
               judgment which never turneth back, its never-failing word, and its dominion which can
               never fall into contempt. This faith, the mistress of triumphant deeds, did <persName>Jesus</persName>
               make the foundation of the Church, and the beginning of the building of His holy
               Body, that He might teach all men to begin therewith, and that the disciple might
               make it the foundation of all his rule and conduct of life. It was not set by Him to
               be the foundation of the Church to show its power only, but also to teach every man
               who might wish to begin to build the new edifice of his discipleship to make it the
               beginning [thereof], and in all other parts of the building it will support and raise
               up the mansions of the virtues. For not one fine stone can go up to the building of
               this tower, unless faith carrieth it up, and there is no life in any of the limbs of
               good deeds <pb type="external" n="49"/>unless the life of faith be in them. And as,
               without the life of the soul, all the members of the body are dead, so without the
               life of faith all the deeds and acts of righteousness are dead. And as the members
               live through the soul so do works live through faith. And as <pb n="46"/>although the
               members of the body may be healthy and sound, yet so long as the soul is not in them
               they are useless, and their beauty and healthiness profit them nothing, so although a
               man may be sound in the running [of the race] of righteousness, and work strenuously
               in his rule and conduct of life, as long as faith be not in the members of his works,
               his service is in vain. And as all the members receive feeling from the life of the
               soul, for through the life thereof each one of them moveth in the ordering of its
               nature, and in the service which appertaineth thereto—the eye to see, the ear to
               hear, the palate to taste, the nostrils to draw breath, the hand to touch, the feet
               to walk—and the whole body moveth and worketh, and trembleth with the movements of
               life in every form through the service of all its members, so also in this manner are
               the members of the works of righteousness, and as long as the life of faith be not in
               them they are dead and useless.</p>
            <p>For fasting is not fasting if faith be not therewith, and alms are accounted nothing
               if they be not given in faith; <pb type="external" n="50"/>neither is loving-kindness
               anything if faith be not therewith. The life of the Nazarite and ascetic is nothing
               unless faith be mingled therewith, and humility and subjection are nothing unless
               faith supporteth them, and painful seclusion is nothing if faith be not therewith;
               for the blessing of faith is not mingled therein, neither is it accounted a blessing,
               and the name of righteousness which is not mingled with faith perisheth, and its
               labours are in vain. For as the shadow of the body is not called the body, and as the
               shadow of the hand or foot is not called by the name of one of the members, so also
               the body of <pb n="47"/>righteousness in which there existeth not the life of faith
               cannot be called the body, nor can fasting be called fasting, or self-denial and
               asceticism be called by the names of true members. Without faith they all are a
               shadow and a dead body; and they cannot be spoken of as a true body, for they stand
               in suspicion, and they toil in a strange vineyard. And faith is the hedge [which
               protecteth] the plants of the commandments of <persName>Christ</persName>, and every plant which is
               found inside this hedge belongeth to <persName>Christ</persName>, and is planted in His vineyard, and
               those plants which are outside this hedge are called wild plants, which either bear
               no fruit at all, or if they bear any, the wild beast trampleth down and the birds of
               the air destroy it; and if it come to pass that they remain they are parched, and the
               sweetness of food is not in them.</p>
            <p>This is the vineyard <pb type="external" n="51"/>for which the master of the house
               hired labourers, and every one whom he saw standing outside he accounted idle, and
               persuaded him to work in his vineyard. By faith the good things which have been
               discovered may be preserved, and by faith those things which are not [in us] may be
               acquired. For faith gathereth treasure together, and preserveth riches; it layeth up
               wealth and, preserveth it. Faith is the foundation and the architect, and faith is
               laid out under the structure of the building, and it mounteth up therewith. Faith
               formeth the members, and faith maketh them to live. Faith planteth the plants of the
               spirit, and faith tilleth the plants of the spirit. Faith is the hedge [round about]
               the plants, and faith is the fountain which watereth them. Faith giveth birth, and
               faith is the nurse. Faith is the body, and faith is the soul which is in the body.
               Faith <pb n="48"/>scattereth seed, and faith reapeth and gathereth in the crops.
               Faith planteth the trees, and faith plucketh and carrieth in the fruit thereof. Faith
               is everything, for faith is sufficient to be everything.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O disciple, lay hold upon this faith, and in this sure thing be strong and
               slacken not; and whatsoever thou believest, ask and thou shalt receive [it] from
               <persName>Christ</persName> Who hath promised to give it, to Whom, and to His Father, and to the Holy
               Ghost, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here endeth the Second Discourse, which is on Faith.</p>
