            <head type="title">The Tenth Discourse: which is against the lust of the belly, and which bringeth an
               accusation against greediness, and which revealeth and sheweth all its forms, and
               which also blameth those who make their lives subject unto this passion, and which
               maketh known that it is impossible for those who labour in bondage unto their lusts
               to draw nigh unto the knowledge and working of any of the triumphs of virtue.</head>
            <p>Now although all the evil passions and the service of the lusts are abominated and
               detested by the word of Divine knowledge, the filthy passion of the lust of the
               belly, which is wont to make those men who are subject thereto like unto beasts, is
               more abominated and detested than they all, because it taketh away from them the
               motions of knowledge which are seemly unto rational beings, and it sinketh and
               darkeneth their mind under the weight of meats; for this stinking and filthy passion
               is the door of all wickedness, and wherever it hath power, like a great, wide door,
               is it open for the entrance <pb type="external" n="354"/>of all abominable things. It
               is the destroyer of all excellence, it impedeth all righteousness, and it is the
               obstacle to all divine works in every shape <pb n="338"/>and form. The man who is
               bent double beneath this abominable lust is not able to take up the yoke of the
               discipleship of <persName>Christ</persName>, because when the belly hath become the mistress of the
               body, it commandeth and subdueth it unto all its wishes, and instead of the way which
               ascendeth unto heaven, it sheweth unto him that other path which goeth down into
               <placeName>Sheol</placeName>. And it hangeth upon him the weight of meats, and superfluities of foods, and
               it soaketh him, and maketh him heavy with the superabundance of drink, for when he
               carrieth the weight of meats, his lightness is weighed downwards, and when another
               body of lust is piled upon his own body, he goeth down easily, and descendeth the
               path the descent of which leadeth down into <placeName>Sheol</placeName>. For the passion of the lust of
               the belly is the filthiest of all the passions, and whosoever hath once become a
               slave thereunto, and hath borne upon his shoulder its heavy yoke, it never again
               giveth unto him rest from its service, but by day and by night it worketh in him, and
               it sendeth him, like a tired servant, whithersoever it pleaseth, not by smooth ways,
               but by paths which are filled with stumblingblocks, and into a country in which
               [only] harm can be found; and the lover of lusts hath no eyes to see the light, for
               although paths exist, yet are they darkened by the weight of meats. Broad daylight is
               night unto him, and by night a second death sinketh his understanding in the
               heaviness of sleep. His thoughts are scattered abroad by the wandering of the
               moisture <pb type="external" n="355"/>of the body; the fire of nature is also cold
               within him because the inordinate moisture in him extinguisheth it; his thoughts are
               eclipsed from knowledge because the eye of his soul, which should look earnestly
               after knowledge, is sealed up; and a heavy <pb n="339"/>weight is hung upon him at
               all times, because he hath joined another body of meats unto his own body like a
               twin. Now therefore the lust of the belly is an obstacle unto everything; it is the
               enemy of all contests of fortitude, it is the destroyer of fair renown, and it
               impedeth all triumphs, not only the triumphs of the spirit, but also those of the
               body. And, moreover, the lust of the belly is an obstacle also unto those who live in
               the world by bravery and strength, because manly endurance is of use to every thing
               which belongeth to name and fame, and health is necessary thereunto, and it hath need
               of lightness of limb, and of healthy strength; but to all these the lust of
               greediness is an obstacle. For when the strength diminisheth by reason of the
               abundance of meats, and the power of the members hath left them, they are no longer
               ready for work, nor are they active for the labours of righteousness, and, as I have
               said,—if a man will only look carefully with the eye of knowledge—the weight of meats
               is an obstacle unto everything, unto the power of the body, and unto the knowledge of
               the soul, and unto the works of righteousness, and unto the works of loving-kindness,
               and unto the gifts of alms. Whosoever is subject unto his belly is a beast, and is
               without discretion, and all his doings are like unto those of the animals, and since
               his whole stability is moved by carnal passions, <pb type="external" n="356"/>he is
               utterly unprofitable in those of the soul. And thou mayest understand from things
               themselves that the lust of the belly is an obstacle unto all the virtuous deeds of
               which I have spoken; to instruction, to knowledge, to the brave endurance of the
               world, to the labours of righteousness, to loving-kindness unto the children of men,
               to love, and to the knowledge of <pb n="340"/>God. That it is an obstacle unto
               instruction the world also testifieth by the tradition which cometh down thereunto,
               for children who are set apart to receive instruction are kept by their parents from
               a superfluity of food, because gluttony is a fence against instruction, for when the
               the members bear the weight of food they are not able to carry the lightness of
               instruction, for lightness is the opposite of heaviness. So then the children who
               receive instruction take food by measure, that their mind may be [keen], and their
               thoughts are ready, and their memory clear both to receive and to retain, for
               superfluity of food preventeth both. And not only are children who are receiving the
               learning of instruction prevented from taking a superfluity of food, [but other men
               also who are learning some handicraft of the world, for their masters watch them
               carefully, and schoolmasters take good heed unto them, and each is a watcher and a
               guardian against too much food and inordinate drink, for they eat and drink by
               measure; and thus also is it with those who learn the empty professions of the world,
               dancers, or charioteers, or athletes; or those who learn the art of war, or others
               who receive the learning of books. And if these arts which are wrought by the body,
               and the knowledge which is received from the world need moderation in food—which if
               it be taken in superabundance becometh an obstacle unto them—how much more doth
               superfluity of food become an obstacle unto the things which are fulfilled in the
               spirit?]<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n340-1"/> And so also is it with those who receive <pb type="external"
                  n="357"/>instruction, and who exercise themselves in the endurance of the things
                  <pb n="341"/>of the world; and others also who possess the knowledge of the world
               have themselves need of endurance. There is no man who hath drawn nigh unto learning,
               or unto the writing of books, or unto oratory, who is not sure that superfluity of
               food is an obstacle thereunto. For the thick smoke of food, when it increaseth and is
               not purified away, covereth the heart with gloom, and blackeneth the understanding,
               and confuseth the intelligence, and shutteth the door in the face of the production
               of fluency of speech, and it is like a covering spread over all the intellectual
               senses, and it preventeth and destroyeth the power of their working. The man who is
               endowed with the gift of speech cannot speak if he be heavy with food, neither can
               the man of knowledge know, nor the man of understanding understand; and so to say,
               all the inner man becometh dark through the smoke of the dulness which ariseth from
               food. And since a light and spiritual nature are mingled in us, the body should seek
               spirituality and lightness, and in proportion as the body becometh attenuated through
               abstinence, it gaineth association with the spirituality thereof; and so long as a
               too great weight [of food] be not laid thereupon, it acquireth the lightness
               wherewith it participateth in the lightness of the soul. Now therefore by a wise
               dispensation a portion of the spirit was placed in a portion of the body, <pb
                  type="external" n="358"/>and as the body becometh heavy with meats, it draweth and
               bringeth down the soul thereto, and it hangeth its own weight upon it, and it tieth
               and fettereth the wings of the thoughts of the soul; but if the life of the body be
               maintained constantly by a sparing use of food, it becometh light, and purified, and
               refined, and the heaviness of its nature dwindleth away and it maketh <pb n="342"
               />bright the soul which is in it, and maketh it glad, and is, moreover, itself
               obedient readily unto its will. And because it is light and refined the soul leadeth
               it to whatsoever it desireth, and the body resisteth not the soul, and its heaviness
               doth not prevent the soul from stablishing it in the country which it seeketh. For
               each of these, whether it be the body, or the soul, draweth the other unto its own
               will, because they are contrary to each other in their natures, and also in their
               wills, according to the word of <persName>the Apostle</persName>, who said, <quote>The body lusteth for that
               which injureth the spirit, and the spirit lusteth for that which injureth the body;
               and the two are contrary each to each.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n342-1"/> Now if, according to the word of the
               wise <persName>Apostle</persName>, all the lusts of the body are contrary to the soul, the lust of the
               belly must be more [contrary] than they all, because it is the door of all lusts, and
               among them all there is none so heavy as it is. For as a weight which is light and
               volatile by nature, if suspended, inclineth downwards, even so is this lust of the
               belly, for it is composed of moisture and weight, and although the body naturally
               possesseth weight—for its nature is so to do—yet by a superabundance of food, other
               weight is added thereunto, and when weight is added unto weight, <pb type="external"
                  n="359"/>and body is doubled upon body, that is to say, the body of food upon the
               body of nature, the weight upon the soul increaseth, and the mistress becometh a
               handmaid in subjection; for the soul cannot henceforth rule over the body like a free
               thing, but it beareth the weight thereof like a slave.</p>
            <p>And the lust of the belly is also contrary to <pb n="343"/>loving-kindness, because
               everything which is distributed by the gift thereof it turneth towards itself, and
               maketh it its own; and if it should happen that it would perform an act of
               loving-kindness—which is impossible—the thought of benevolence never moveth in it
               except it be already filled itself, and it is as if the greedy man were to give
               gifts, for it would appear that his gift is bestowed only when his own belly is full.
               And this is not loving-kindness, but is like unto the habit of a beast and wild
               animal, for even the beast, when it hath filled its belly, will leave its manger, and
               lie down; and thus also is it with the glutton, for until he hath filled his belly at
               the table of his lusts he will not permit himself to look upon any other man with the
               eye of compassion. And he will not give to him that is needy of what is set before
               him, because he is in such subjection unto his lust that he thinketh that no one is
               as needy as himself, and in very truth there is no one in such need as the man who is
               in subjection unto his own lust. For however much a man may give unto the cravings of
               lust, it still abideth in its needy condition, and it is never satisfied even with a
               collection of meats, but in proportion as it eateth meats it raveneth for others, and
               in proportion as it drinketh it lusteth eagerly for draughts of clear and sparkling
               wine. <pb type="external" n="360"/>In proportion as it hath food it hungereth and is
               not satisfied, and in proportion as it drinketh it thirsteth, and its thirst is not
               quenched; for however much the glutton eateth he still hungereth, and however much he
               drinketh, he still thirsteth. Unto the lust of the belly there is no end, for when it
               hath been filled by its first [supply of] food, inasmuch as it is not for its need's
               sake that it is determined to fill [itself], but for <pb n="344"/>its lust's sake, it
               seeketh other food which is more dainty than the first. And again when it hath taken
               of this sufficient to please lust, it looketh out for other food which is more
               agreeable and more tasty, and thus its gluttony rangeth over all meats one by one,
               and it is not filled by them all. And if he thinketh that he is satisfied, and he
               stayeth his hand from the food, his lust is not satisfied, even though his belly be
               filled, and it can hold no more; but he wisheth that his belly were as capacious as
               his lust, and that his stomach were even as his eye, in order that he might be able
               to gather together whatsoever he lusted after and to put it in his perforated
               storehouse. The lover of possessions is a greedy fool, for he gathereth together and
               layeth up the treasures of his lusts in a house with a rent therein which keepeth
               nothing that is placed therein, and the Creator also, in order to rebuke the lust of
               gluttons, made a fixed limit to the capacity of the belly, so that of sheer
               necessity, even though it were against their will, their lusts might be restrained.
               Now when the desire would load itself with much [food] although the cavity of the
               belly cannot receive it, behold desire is not kept back by force from its lust's
               quest; but though its desire lusteth, the small cavity of the belly, which is not
               able to hold [much], restraineth it. For if <pb type="external" n="361"/>the belly
               were large enough to receive all things which gluttons lust after, the sea, and land,
               and air, and sun, and all the other natural bodies would not be sufficient to satisfy
               their lusts. And behold if, now that a vessel of small capacity hath been given unto
               their vast desire, sea and land are not sufficient for them, and they gather together
               all kinds [of food], and are not filled, and <pb n="345"/>everything which they lust
               after, and are not satisfied, and they ask for and seek after all the meats which are
               remote from them, if they had a belly as large as their desire what would they not
               do?</p>
            <p>Now therefore the glutton is worse than any wild animal, for the beast, when it hath
               filled its belly, leaveth what remains of its food in the manger, and it knoweth not
               how to keep it for another time or for another day; but with the glutton it is not
               so, for, because his lust is not satisfied when his belly is filled, when he hath
               filled that measure which is in him, and which is ordained by nature to receive food,
               his lust taketh what remaineth, and keepeth it for another day, that is to say for
               days and months. The glutton sitteth at the table of his need, and meditateth upon
               the times which are about to come; he taketh not only care to feed when food is at
               hand, but he thinketh upon what he shall eat tomorrow. His hand is upon the
               bread-basket which is near, and his mind is fixed upon the table which is far off; he
               beareth food in his right hand and in his left, but both of them are insufficient to
               bring fuel to the fire which is in him. All his members minister unto the cruel
               mistress which he hath voluntarily set over himself, <pb type="external" n="362"/>and
               they are not by any means whatsoever able to satisfy her by their service; his eyes,
               and hands, and feet are made slaves unto her, and they suffice not. He thinketh
               concerning her with his inner man, and with his outer man he followeth her about
               earnestly; but like a mistress who is to be ministered unto, she is not satisfied;
               and like <placeName>Sheol</placeName> she received stinkingness, and is not filled; and like the fire she
               receiveth fuel of meats, and she sayeth not, <quote>Enough;</quote> and like the earth she <pb
                  n="346"/>drinketh, and is not satisfied; and like the eye, she lusteth for
               everything, but is not filled with anything; and the glutton wisheth that he had
               other members which would be sufficient to minister unto the iniquitous mistress
               which he hath gotten. The gaze of the eye of the glutton is also fixed upon him that
               sitteth with him at the table, and he looketh upon him with a malignant eye lest he
               eat too much, and forthwith he either counteth his pieces of food in his mind, or
               [feareth] that peradventure the portion which is set before him is greater than his
               own; for his belly receiveth meats, but his mind meditateth upon his neighbour which
               sitteth with him. Now the evilness of the lust of the belly is spread out upon
               everything, and if its eye be evil upon him that is near him, how can it help being
               evil upon him that is his companion at table? What then? Though lust lay up [food]
               for days and months, yet is it envious of others who are remote therefrom; and it
               asketh about every man what food he eateth, and what preparations of food are made
               and set out on his table, and what is the measure of his food; and when it hath made
               enquiries, and hath measured its own dainties and delicacies with that which it
               heareth concerning his, if its things are more <pb type="external" n="363"/>than his
               it rejoiceth, and if his are more than its own, it is immediately filled with grief,
               and with the grief there is also envy, and with the envy there is wrath of mind
               because a man existeth who hath more meats than he hath. What then? And although the
               greedy glutton is envious of those who are afar off, his eye looketh not away from
               him that is at the table with him, and although he may not say openly unto him, <quote>Thou
               shalt not eat</quote>—now shame preventeth him from saying this—yet <pb n="347"/>his mind
               desireth this eagerly, saying, <quote>How I wish that he would stay his hand,</quote> in order
               that that which is upon the table may be sufficient for his own gluttony. Now
               therefore the lust of the belly is more loathsome and disgusting than all the other
               lusts, and it hath not similitude among the other passions; but it is the mother and
               nurse of them all. For as a root of a tree beareth the branches and everything else
               which is on them, even so also is the gluttony of the belly the root of all
               wickednesses; and as the twigs and boughs spring from the roots, even so do all the
               passions of the lusts spring therefrom. Gluttony giveth birth [to them], and reareth
               [them], and feedeth [them], and worketh [them], and all wickedness is perfected
               therefrom; with it a man beginneth the path of the left hand, and it becometh the
               first step which a man taketh outside the path of that which is right. For, as
               abstinence, that is to say the fasting from all meats, is the beginning <pb
                  type="external" n="364"/>of the way of the strife of righteousness, even so also
               is the lust of the belly the beginning of works of shame. And if thou wilt look with
               the eye of knowledge, O disciple, thou wilt see that all vices, one after the other,
               follow thereafter. For first of all it darkeneth the understanding from the
               meditation of God, and it obscureth the mind from the remembrance of <persName>Christ</persName>, and
               when the memorial of God hath been removed from the soul there can be no doubt that a
               man deviseth and doeth every kind of wickedness. For as the remembrance of the
               beginning of everything which is done in the world ariseth from us, and until we have
               received in our minds the remembrance of things we do not draw nigh to the doing
               thereof, even so also is the remembrance <pb n="348"/>of God the beginning of all
               virtues; therefore when a man hath God in remembrance he draweth nigh unto the
               service of things which are fair. And if a man doeth that which is good, and is not
               mindful of God when he doeth it, his good deed is not of God, but of that which his
               memory brought into his mind when he did it.</p>
            <p>Behold then, to this virtue which is the beginning of all virtues—I speak now of the
               remembrance of God—the lust of the belly is contrary, in addition also to its being
               the beginning of all wickedness, For as the remembrance of God standeth at the
               beginning of the path of virtues, even so also doth the lust of the belly stand at
               the beginning of the path of all wickedness; and when the two beginnings are contrary
               to each other, and one of them hath overcome the other, together with the first which
               is vanquished <pb type="external" n="365"/>are vanquished also all those things which
               follow thereafter. For as it is impossible for a house to be built without
               foundations, even so also it is impossible for virtues to exist without the
               remembrance of God, And as a building which is not set upon a firm foundation is
               certainly nigh to fall, even so also a change which is nigh necessarily cleaveth unto
               the virtues which are not built upon the remembrance of God, and they abide not in
               the firmness of their fabric, because there is no sure foundation to sustain
               them.</p>
            <p>Now gluttony and the filling of the belly first of all remove the remembrance of God
               from the soul, and when the foundation hath been uprooted, all the virtues are
               uprooted therewith. And gluttony is also the contrary of fasting, it is the destroyer
               of prayer, it is that which polluteth the purity of the thoughts, it <pb n="349"
               />obscureth the understanding, and darkeneth the mind, and defileth the intelligence,
               and abrogateth instruction, and killeth knowledge. It is the bane of wisdom, and
               leadeth astray the memory, it depicteth phantoms, and is the mother of things which
               are imagined, it is the drunkenness of the soul, and it abaseth the mind, it
               produceth slumber, and multiplieth disturbing dreams, it giveth birth unto
               fornication, and polluteth the body, it causeth an unnatural flow of seed, it is the
               fire of lust, it is the director of adultery, and it committeth whoredom even without
               members. It is the eye which lusteth after everything, it is the kinswoman of sloth,
               and the mother of indifference, and the cause of the love of mammon; it is the enemy
               of the wise, <pb type="external" n="366"/>and it hateth teachers. It is the means of
               passage of all abominable things, it is the nurse of envy, the sickness of health,
               the feebleness of strength, the cowardice of the body, the grub [which destroyeth]
               the limbs, the worm [that eateth] the body, the diminution of the power of the
               senses, the wandering among empty cares, the kinswoman of animals, the associate of
               beasts, the foe of bold athletes, the envier of the prosperous, the overthrower of
               labours, the stumbling-block of the life of virtue, the lover of empty conversations,
               the seeker of pleasure always, the silencer of holy song. It lacketh all virtues, and
               is abundant in all vices, it is a noxious form, a stone set in the way to trip up
               many, a dangerous example which causeth slackness in all who behold it, the
               counsellor of vices, the fugitive from afflictions, the lover of pleasures, the
               seeker after feasts and banquets, the sickness alike of the body and of the soul, the
               vessel of stinkingness, the odour of filth, the fountain of the excrement of the
               body, the lover of darkness, <pb n="350"/>the kinswoman of blackness, it eateth
               alone. It is the enemy of those who do not give thereto, a filthy shape, a loathsome
               form which cannot be depicted, the enemy of God, the uprooting of belief, the
               beginning of the path of error, the door which leadeth into all abominable things,
               the exactor of tribute from all, the oppressor of all, the nurse of fear, the
               destroyer of courage, the cause of sorrow and sickness, the food of hardness of
               heart, and the consort of the gluttonous dog which returneth to its vomit. It is
               abounding in diseases, it is the possessor of sicknesses, the withholder <pb
                  type="external" n="367"/>of the produce of labours, the first cause of straying
               away from God, and the worshipper of idols. And if a man were to collect ten thousand
               times ten thousand of such names as these, and were to apply them unto the lust of
               the belly, they would be too few [to describe] it, and it would not have been called
               by the names which it deserveth; for it is a mistress who is opposed unto God. And as
               all great and glorious names, if applied to God, would still be too few [to describe]
               Him, and they would be insufficient to shew forth the fairness and the beauty of His
               nature, even so if the lust of the belly were to be called by every name possible,
               those names would not suffice to shew forth its loathsomeness, and its hideous
               appearance. For of what fair thing is not this vice the destroyer? and naturally man
               calleth it the wickedness of all wickedness, the iniquity of the iniquitous, and the
               sin of sinners. Now therefore the glutton is not able to do any thing else except
               only to eat. For all matters are accounted empty by him except this, and he thinketh
               that a man was made for nothing else except to satisfy his lusts; for the
               conversation of the glutton is fixed wholly <pb n="351"/>upon his belly, and the
               whole aim of his discourse is directed towards this. Whatever subject thou dost bring
               up before him, he avoideth, and bringeth thee to the discourse concerning the belly;
               for before the food [cometh] the remembrance thereof is sweet unto him, and although
               he is not yet at the table, his whole thought is set thereupon, and although he is
               not <pb type="external" n="368"/>actually eating, in his thought and speech he is
               wholly [intent] upon food. The beginning and end of his speech are derived from his
               belly, with it he begins, and with it he ends, and it is the reason of all his
               speaking. If thou repeatest doctrine before him, it is accounted a vain thing by him,
               and if thou speakest, or if thou proclaimest spiritual things before him, he thinketh
               that he seeth a dream; and if he heareth of the noble deeds of holy men, and of the
               labours and life of virtue, and the strenuousness of righteous men, he doth not
               believe that they are true. The explanations of the Holy Books are accounted idle and
               superfluous stones by him, for the word of interpretation sendeth him to sleep, and
               the discourse of admonition draweth sleep upon him; for the things which they cry and
               teach are not accounted work by him, because he thinketh that there is no work which
               is better than his own. The search after truth he nameth <quote>debate</quote>, and conversation
               upon faith he calleth <quote>seeking for proofs</quote>, and the man who hath his meditation fixed
               upon the Scriptures, he considereth audacious and curious. And if he seeth a man
               constant in reading he saith unto him, <quote>Thou hast no work [to do],</quote> and if he seeth
               another hastening, and asking questions, and seeking to gather and store up within
               himself the knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>, his life is considered by him one <pb n="352"/>of
               emptiness. He applieth the name <quote>vices</quote> to the virtues, so that in blaspheming them
               he may free himself from blame, and that he may not be blamed for not being constant
               in doing the things which are excellent. He holdeth virtues to be weaknesses, in
               order that his own loathsomeness may not be accused by those who see him; he maketh
               hateful by his speech the comeliness of good things, and he blasphemeth deeds which
               are subjects for glorifying, together with <pb type="external" n="369"/>those who do
               them. He holdeth divine doctrine and those who learn it to be objects of rebuke, and
               he maketh an accusation against the wisdom of <persName>Christ</persName> and against those who seek it.
               He repeateth evil things against knowledge and the disciples thereof, but because it
               is not easy for him to speak openly against wisdom and knowledge, reading and
               doctrine, faith and the quest of the truth, constant meditation upon the words of the
               Spirit, spiritual converse with the Holy Books, and secret communing with the
               mysteries of God, and the word of God, which is the sustenance of the soul, because
               it is not easy for him to blaspheme these things outwardly I say, he blasphemeth
               those who do them, and he thereby poureth contempt upon glorious things.</p>
            <p>And he doth also blaspheme them openly, for he called the discoursing upon faith
               <quote>prying,</quote> and the quest of truth <quote>debate,</quote> and the doctrine of the Holy Books
               <quote>superfluous seeking after proofs;</quote> for behold, he is not aware that he calleth
               virtues vices, and that he nameth as abominations things which are comely. Zeal for
               God's sake is set down as contention by him, and the man who contendeth for the truth
               he considereth to be a disturber of the peace; and that a <pb n="353"/>man receiveth
               not the persons of men for God's sake is called audacity by him. If a man counselleth
               him, saying, <quote>Stand up, and shew zeal for God's sake,</quote> he crieth out to him, <quote>I am
               not intended for this, and I do not subject myself to such like things; for these are
               vain things to me, and I do not devote my attention to vain things.</quote> And if he be
               asked by a man, <quote>What dost thou desire?</quote> he returneth <pb type="external" n="370"
               />answer shamelessly, <quote>To eat what God hath provided for us, and to lead a quiet
               life,</quote> that is to say, to minister unto our bellies, and to forsake faith—for this is
               the meaning of the words—although we may dress them in a humbler garb than this. And
               he is not ashamed to seek for the bread of God, and to deny the truth of His
               existence and to look upon His grace, and to despise faith in Him. He feigneth to be
               as one who loveth a quiet life, and feigneth to flee from contention and trouble,
               even when things are not troubled; but in truth he is afraid to trouble that mistress
               of wickedness whom he serveth in anything, and to be deprived from any cause of the
               carnal pleasures which he hath once taken to himself. To cease from instruction is
               accounted wisdom unto him, and that a man should cease from [seeking] to know what
               faith is, is thought by him to be faith, and he saith, <quote>It is not necessary for us to
               learn anything else, for it is sufficient for us to believe and to be silent;</quote> and
               being an unbeliever, he taketh refuge in faith, not because he loveth it, but because
               he is fond of his belly, and loveth himself. He <choice><sic>quieteth</sic><corr>quitteth</corr></choice> the course of
               faith, that the quest of his lusts may go forward; outwardly his speech is for
               truth's sake, but inwardly he speaketh against the truth, and his contention is on
                  <pb n="354"/>behalf of himself. Where he is called to shew forth earnestness, he
               bringeth forward the life of contemplation into the midst [as an excuse], and where
               zeal and courage for faith's sake are demanded, he teacheth and exhorteth every man
               to lead a quiet life unto himself. If a healthy word is let fall he goeth to sleep,
               but if baleful converse ariseth he waketh himself up; if <pb type="external" n="371"
               />discourses concerning the interpretations of Scripture enter in, he slumbereth, but
               if riddles, and idle stories, and foolish parables of the world, and the foolish
               babbling of old women are mooted, behold he is ready and is the first to repeat them,
               and he is prepared and hath the habit to be the first to say them; for one knoweth
               not anything which will keep his lust in subjection, except it be boastful talk,
               because his soul lacketh fruit, and it is filled with a collection of leaves of
               senseless stories. He hasteth and taketh refuge in feigned ignorance when he heareth
               the truth spoken of, and being crafty for wickedness, and artful unto wrath, a man's
               ignorance of the truth he nameth simplicity, and his delivering his faith unto those
               who err is accounted faith by him. He commandeth every man to be silent from
               spiritual things in order that he may have the opportunity of repeating the vain
               things which he loveth; and to high and to low the story which he tells is of the
               lusts of his belly, and of the pleasures of his body, for he neither knoweth nor
               perceiveth that there existeth anything else except the service of his belly.</p>
            <p>Now therefore the glutton beareth a resemblance unto wild beasts in all his ways and
               manners, but his soul is, moreover, even more degraded and debased than <pb n="355"
               />theirs. For the beasts were created by their Maker to do two things: that
               sustaining their lives by their food, they should do work and service for the human
               race; but the glutton eateth and worketh not, and although he is diligent at the
               table, he is useless for every kind of work of excellence. The soul which ministereth
               unto the belly feeleth not God, because it is asleep unto <pb type="external" n="372"
               />all thoughts of knowledge, and unto the meditation of God, for the knowledge of the
               soul springeth from the lightness of the senses and of members of the body, and the
               lightness of the body ariseth from the sparing use of food; but it is well known that
               the glutton is bowed down beneath two things, the thick darkness of the thoughts and
               the heaviness of the body. For narratives of the labours of the strenuous [lie] heavy
               upon him, because they are contrary to his manner of life. And if by chance he
               heareth that a certain man of abstinence by reason of love for his brother hath
               broken his rule of self-abnegation, either like a free man through the force of
               sickness, or through the necessity of weakness, to prop up his labour-bearing body,
               and hath passed a short time in living a less strict life, he layeth hold of this,
               and repeateth it at all times, saying, <quote>Such and such an one eateth [meat],</quote> and he
               uttereth this before everyone in order that it may be an excuse for his own lax way
               of living, and that he may thereby hide his abominable lusts. Now, O glutton, it is
               not thus, as thou thinkest, and the prosperous servants of <persName>Christ</persName> do not eat with
               the aim with which thou eatest, neither do they satisfy their lusts by their food;
               for they have not made themselves slaves of their belly, like unto thee, but they
               take food for their bare wants only. </p>
            <pb n="356"/>
            <p>And thou must not deprive them even of the food which they abase themselves to eat
               for want's sake, but consider also their abstinence, and look closely into the
               protracted period of their self-denial, for they eat not to fulfil lust, but for
               need's sake. That a man eateth for lust's sake is one thing, and that he eateth for
               need's sake is another. Whosoever eateth for his need's sake eateth unto his soul,
               and not unto his body, because <pb type="external" n="373"/>he nourisheth his body
               that it may be found ready and prepared at all times for the soul which hath need
               thereof; but whosoever eateth for lust's sake, his eating is unto his body, and not
               unto his soul. For it never entereth into his mind that he hath in him a spiritual
               nature, but only, as from afar off, doth he hear by the word of others that he hath a
               soul in him; and the soul of the glutton is dead, and even while it is in him, it is
               as if it existed not. For when by reason of some cause of its own, it neither moveth,
               nor worketh, nor acteth, it is dead unto all the motions of knowledge, and all its
               acts and life are only of the body; for behold, since it existeth, it cannot be as if
               it existed not, and dwelling in the body, it cannot be thought to be not in the body.
               For the body is known by two things, by its appearance, and by its works, but the
               soul can only be known by its works, because its nature is beyond the sight. Hence it
               followeth that the soul, being in the glutton by the act of the Creator, is not in
               him according to his own will, because the works by which it is known that the soul
               existeth in him are not found with him, and therefore the soul of the glutton maketh
               accusation against him and murmureth against him, even though he perceiveth not its
               murmurings, because he is dead thereunto. For as a living body may cleave <pb n="357"
               />unto a dead body perceiving it not, even so the soul of the glutton cleaveth unto
               his body while he perceiveth it not, and whoso liveth unto his lusts only, and not
               unto the soul, is a corpse which is borne and carried out to be buried.</p>
            <p>And although the passions, as I have already said, deserve blame by the word of
               righteousness, <pb type="external" n="374"/>yet this unseemly passion deserveth blame
               most of all, not only because it is contrary unto knowledge, but because it is also
               the enemy of God. The man, who hath sunk into the useless life of the lust of the
               belly, is accounted as nothing, both by the world, and by God, and neither the one
               nor the other will receive him; because the world demandeth diligent exertion, and
               God also asketh for labour, and afflictions, and purity of soul, from the children of
               men, and if a man hath them not God will not receive him. Now gluttony is contrary
               unto these things, and it fleeth before labours and afflictions, and a man who would
               jest in speech at the vice of the lust of the belly cannot, I think, be found,
               especially one who has not had experience of the passions thereof; for fasting is its
               foe, and the report of abstinence and self-denial terrifieth and stupefieth it.</p>
            <p>The glutton liveth for nothing except only to lead a life like unto that of the
               beasts, and although he is a beast in very deed, if a man calleth him by this name,
               he is wrathful, and the fool doth not understand that that which another man sayeth
               of him in words, is found to exist in him in very deed; it is not another who abuseth
               him, but he himself is the abuser, for when opprobrious words are removed from him,
               he himself is the root of his own disgrace. Whom can this wretched man blame? and how
               shall he chide those who speak <pb n="358"/>against him? For behold, he hath set <pb
                  type="external" n="375"/>himself in the midst of the community to be the subject
               of the discourse of others, for every man meditateth upon him, and every man speaketh
               about him; one shooteth out the lip, and another winketh with his eye, and another
               pointeth [at him] with his finger, and others whisper and repeat stories of his lax
               life. Now the soul of the glutton is made to endure [more] than any other sufferer,
               and although all these things happen unto him, he endureth them, and rejoiceth,
               having made the pleasure of his belly his sole consolation. And the fool doth not
               understand that henceforth toil and trouble will come upon him from all sides, even
               though he would take upon himself to bear the labours of the ascetic life, rather
               than the reproaches of the lust of the belly. So then, whether from laxity or whether
               from abstinence, from all sides weariness will come upon the man; but it is better to
               bear labours with praise for the sake of abstinence, than weariness with reproaches
               and disgrace for the sake of gluttony. Now the glutton [endureth] more than the
               ascetic, not in subduing his lusts, but in ministering thereunto; not in acquiring
               endurance, but in serving the bondage of his belly; not in bearing the afflictions
               which befit the life of brave exertion, but in serving, with weariness and fatigue,
               the lusts of his dissolute life, or in gathering together and in bringing to himself
               the materials of his lusts—like fuel which is gathered together [and brought] to the
               fire—or in carrying the weight of meats after he hath eaten them. For the meats are
               heavier to the belly which hath eaten [overmuch] than is a load of lead to the
               shoulder, and immediately a man hath eaten inordinately, the weight presseth upon his
               whole body, and all <pb type="external" n="376"/>his members <pb n="359"/>become
               sluggish, and the power of his senses dwindleth away, and the sight of his eye
               becometh darkened by the abundance of the flow of its moisture, and the hearing of
               the ear becometh heavy, and the speech of his tongue becometh halting, and the mind,
               which is the fountain of words, becometh clouded, and the understanding, which is the
               helms man of wisdom, becometh stupefied, and the flow of his words is involved and
               entangled, his bones shake away from their places, and the knees totter and the hands
               tremble; and the vessel of the person of the glutton breaketh up and becometh old
               before its time, by reason of the superfluous weights which he maketh it to
               carry.</p>
            <p>Now the sicknesses which are born from an overabundance of food are many, and cannot
               be counted, but asceticism doth not make in the body any sickness like unto that
               which gluttony produceth. And gluttons <quote>that they may not fall sick,</quote> as they say,
               devote themselves unto meats, and the fools do not perceive that that from which they
               flee will come upon them; for in the place whither they hasten to receive healing
               there shall they find sickness before them, and where they seek to flee from pains
               there shall be gathered together for them diseases. And who knoweth not that sparing
               food and meagre nourishment give health to the body? especially when to them moderate
               labour is united. And concerning this matter the learning of physicians also
               testifieth, and they, that is to say their learning, or art, which hath been
               discovered for the stablishing of the body, know better than all other arts, that the
               health and sickness of the body arise from the food, <pb type="external" n="377"/>and
               if they be asked, they will always advise sparingness in the use of meat, and in <pb
                  n="360"/>addition to this also they will advise that the food of a man should be
               meagre, and that he should guard against drinking wine freely. And if they allow a
               man to drink wine for need's sake they break the strength thereof with much water,
               and then give it to him to drink. And they command a man very fully to beware of
               idleness, and to love fatigue, and to seek work, and with exercises of all kinds
               which are akin to work they preserve the health of the bodies of the children of men.
               And these they advise <quote>That the ducts of the body may not be filled with the living
               liquid which ariseth from the over-eating of meat, and that they may not be blocked
               up and prevent the passage through them of the living power of the food, which is the
               strengthener of the body.</quote> And this [passage] also is written in their works: <quote>Meat
               is the cause of all the diseases of the body, and though by chance they may be
               produced from other causes, if thou increasest [the use of] meat it becometh a nurse
               unto them, and preventeth wholly the benefits of the art of the physician.</quote></p>
            <p>And in addition to the words of the physicians, it is right for us, like wise men, to
               understand from experience, that the cause of all wickedness, and of the pains and
               sicknesses of the body, ariseth from superfluity of food. And if thou wishest,
               consider carefully the rich, and the poor, and those who lead a quiet life, and those
               who are vexed, and those who are weighted with care, and those who labour, and see
               which of these preserveth <pb type="external" n="378"/>his body in a healthy
               condition, and which of them has many and frequent sicknesses; and in proportion to
               their frequency is the difficulty of healing them. Is it not the rich? is it not
               those who have rent their bellies by <pb n="361"/>overeating? is it not those who,
               before they have digested and emptied themselves of the food which they have just
               eaten, hasten after more for gluttony's sake?</p>
            <p>And theirs are sore and difficult sicknesses, and these are the wages which their
               gluttony giveth unto them, and they deserve to receive this reward from that mistress
               of iniquity whom they serve. They have pains in the hands, and pains in the legs;
               they have the sores and ulcers which arise from superfluity of food; they have
               trembling of the limbs, and dizziness in the head; they have sickness of the bowels,
               together with all the other afflictions which spring up for them out of this thorny
               land. They sink into sleep at all times; they slumber continually at all hours; they
               feel heaviness all over the body, and have sneezings and violent vomitings; and it is
               evident that even the speech of the glutton is sent forth from heavy limbs, and that
               it is produced from a mind which is buried in flesh. All these things happen unto
               gluttons, even though others may bring nigh helps for their bodies continually,
               purgatives, and cleansing draughts, and other means for relieving the body, and
               blood-letting, and medicines which open the bowels, and violent washing with water at
               all hours; but overeating overcometh all these beneficial means, and createth for
               them in their bodies severe pains, <pb type="external" n="379"/>and sore sicknesses,
               which it is difficult even for wise physicians to heal.</p>
            <p>Now the poor man, who passeth his life in labour and weariness, possesseth health of
               body, and his body is light and ready for any piece of work, and there hangeth not
               therein the weight of superabundance. And if by chance, in ignorance he eateth
               immoderately of his meagre fare, the toil of his labour receiveth the <pb n="362"
               />weight of his food immediately, and his labour becometh unto him a constant
               physician, wherefrom, without the intervention of medicines, he receiveth healing.
               And what physician knoweth so well how to heal the body as the toil of labour? and
               besides this labour, without expenses and without medicines—not like a
               physician—removeth medicines from him, and bringeth nigh things which are beneficial.
               And labour is the physician and the medicine, and the bandager and the bandage, and
               the healer and the medicine which healeth, and from it cometh that which is
               beneficial, and in it is the healing of all the members.</p>
            <p>Now in this labour, from which fleeth sluggishness by reason of the love of luxuries,
               poverty findeth healing. Now I do not say that pains never come unto the poor, nor
               that sicknesses never come [in the train of] labours and fatigues, but I do say that
               the pains of the rich are many and are difficult to heal, because they are idle all
               their lives, and because they have made themselves slaves unto their pampered bodies,
               either in ministering unto their lusts, or in reducing the superfluity thereof or in
               healing the sicknesses which are born of satiety; for in idleness these men pass all
               their lives, and besides [their bodies] they perceive not that anything else
               existeth. Now the illness of the poor man <pb type="external" n="380"/>is quick in
               being cured, and the superfluity of his body is little and meagre, and he receiveth
               healing quickly from the medicines which are brought unto him, because the causes
               which increase the superfluities in the body are cut off therefrom. And since these
               things are so, who would not reduce it by the sparing use of food, which is the
               mother of healing? But I am convinced that these words will be accounted unnecessary
               by the glutton, because his ear <pb n="363"/>is closed by his lust, and he is unable
               to hear healthy doctrine, and it is as if his food were made curtains in front of his
               senses, and it prevented them from their natural service. And who would not weep over
               this man who wasteth by his dishonourable indulgence the beautiful work of God? And
               rightly he meriteth punishment, not only because he ministereth unto his lusts, and
               provoketh God to wrath by his lust, but also because he, by his gluttony, destroyeth
               the healthy members which are established in a fair form by the Creator. Whosoever by
               reason of his gluttony destroyeth the members of his body is an associate of the
               murderer, and he is the consort of a destroying thief, and that which is written in
               the Law, <quote>Everyone who slayeth shall be slain, and whosoever cutteth off a member of
               his neighbour, one of his members shall be cut off,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n363-1"/> applieth unto him. Now
               the glutton destroyeth his own members, and little by little he maketh to perish and
               consumeth the power of his body and of his members, and whosoever ruineth the fair
               creation of God, and throweth down the building of his body which the will of the
               Architect builded aforetime, bringeth together for every reason punishments <pb
                  type="external" n="381"/>upon himself, according to the word of righteousness,
               which was uttered before he had transgressed the command of God, Who had commanded
               man not to become a servant unto his lusts. And again, he is impeded [in doing] fair
               things, and in the service of all virtues, which the Holy Books exhort us continually
               to do; and again, he of his own freewill driveth out of himself the remembrance of
               spiritual things; and again, he rejecteth lovingkindness to the poor; and his <pb
                  n="364"/>gluttony stirreth him up to go forth therefrom unto oppression; and
               again, together with these things, he with his own hands ruineth the fair building,
               and lusts destroy the members of the creation of God which He created in His grace
               for the service of His will.</p>
            <p>See then, O glutton, the cause of thy being framed, and tremble before God, and waste
               not thyself; for there is another hope which is not seen, and why is thy hope bound
               up in thy belly? There is another spiritual food, then why dost thou depart after
               vain meats? There is a table of <persName>Christ</persName> which is promised unto His friends, then why
               doth thy expectation hang back and consider the season of the table [which is here]?
               There is another world with its heavenly blessings, then why hast thou bound the hope
               of thy life unto a world which is seen, and why have the excellent things which are
               therein been accounted loss by thee? The Maker did not create thee that thou mightest
               eat like the beasts, but that thou mightest eat like a rational being, and mightest
               glorify Him like a living being. He did not make thee live [only] to eat, but He gave
               thee the power to eat in moderation that thou mightest live thereby. O wretched man,
               thy life was framed not for meats, <pb type="external" n="382"/>but that it might be
               established by food in moderation. Separate thy life from the life of the beasts, and
               be not a servant unto thy belly to make it draw nigh unto the service of lusts which
               destroy. Thou art a wise man, let not thy soul be voluntarily bowed beneath the yoke
               of animals. Thou art the fair image of thy Creator, why shouldst thou carve upon
               thyself the form of animals? The word of Him that created thee hath bidden thee unto
               equality with spiritual beings, then why dost thou wallow with the pigs in the mire
               of lusts, <pb n="365"/>and make thyself filthy? Thou art a consecrated being ordained
               to be with the Seraphim, then why dost thou make thy life like unto that of the dumb
               animal in thy degraded conduct? Thou art the lord of creation by the will of thy
               Creator, then why hast thou made thyself a servant to thy belly of thine own
               freewill? The will of the Creator subdued for thee all creation, and yet a little
               belly leadeth thee in subjection! All things in nature are bowed beneath the yoke of
               thy subjection, and yet the yoke of a destroying mistress is set upon thy shoulder!
               All nations and works are obedient unto thy word, and yet thou hast made thyself a
               degraded servant unto a filthy lust! Thou hast been made a god by the God of truth,
               and yet thou hast made thy belly a god unto thee! Thou art a glorious ruler by His
               work, and yet thou in thy debased estate hast through thy lust brought thyself to be
               a man of no account. He created everything for thy glory, and thou hast changed His
               glory into thy belly. God calleth thee to converse with Him, but thy meditation is
               bound unto the table. Thou wast made a rational vessel of holy and glorious things,
               but thou hast worn thyself out, and hast in thy degraded estate cut the strings of
               thy harp. Thy Lord loved thee so much that He gave thee all this, and also that thou
               shouldst eat, yet thou for love of Him wilt not make thyself to abstain from
               contemptible meats!</p>
            <pb type="external" n="383"/>
            <p>The Living One died, and was buried, that He might make thee to live, yet thou hast
               made thyself a grave for meats! He had no pity upon His own life, but gave it unto
               death for thy life, yet thou wilt not cause thyself to acquire a little forbearance
               for love of Him! O degraded one, consider the life which hath <pb n="366"/>been
               promised to thee, and see what manner of life thou hast lived in the world, and be
               ashamed, even from thy very soul. Henceforth thou shalt not be a grave unto thyself
               whilst thou art alive, and thou shalt not destroy the person which is in thee before
               it be destroyed by the natural grave. Behold, thy soul is buried in thy body, like a
               body in the grave. The body was framed by the Creator to be a glorious vessel for the
               soul, and an associate in all virtues, why then hast thou made it a grave for the
               soul, which being therein is accounted to be in a place of corruption? The body of
               the glutton is destroyed by what he devoureth before natural death destroyeth it, and
               it groweth old and falleth away, little by little, before the habitation of <placeName>Sheol</placeName>
               weareth it out. The pains of the glutton are voluntary and not natural, for although
               they spring from his bodily nature, yet his will is the cause of them, and they are
               born of his own freedom through the superfluity of meats. The man who loveth the
               things which are lusted after leadeth a life of stumbling, and not only doth he sin
               within himself, but also unto others is he a cause of loss. He himself is a disease
               which is set in the midst, and every one who passeth thereover stumbleth over it—the
               sluggish and the active, the wanton and the chaste, the pampered and the ascetic, the
               glutton and the abstemious man—and some are tripped up and fall, and some add unto
               their dissolute habit of life. <pb type="external" n="384"/>The glutton looketh at
               his consort, and again addeth unto his laxity, the dissolute man looketh upon him,
               and again clotheth himself with his laxity, like a garment above a garment, and he
               that is fast held by the lust of his belly looketh upon him, and tarrieth the more
               with the object of his love.</p>
            <pb n="367"/>
            <p>Now those who are athletes and ascetics lose thereby, because they are made to
               stumble, and his affair leadeth them to the discourse which they love not. For on all
               sides he stirreth up war against them, either because they will not degrade
               themselves at the sight of his laxity and become like unto him, or because at the
               repetition of his laxity they will not cease from the converse which is with God, or
               because they cannot be exalted within themselves at their strenuousness when they
               compare their upright lives with his laxity. In the manner in which the strenuous and
               the prosperous benefit both themselves and their companions do the slothful and the
               lovers of lusts injure both themselves and those who behold them; and their lives,
               which they live in the world, are found in every way to be the cause of loss unto the
               children of men. For the childhood of the glutton is a hateful thing, and his manhood
               is a thing to be laughed at, and his old age is a thing to be mocked at. His
               childhood is slothful, his manhood is wanton, and his old age is pampered; in his
               childhood he hath much sport and pleasure, in his manhood adultery and fornication,
               and in his old age the devouring of food and empty conversations. He not only hateth
               the doing of good works, but even hearing it repeated, and not only is the doing of
               them heavy upon him, but also speech concerning them if he heareth it. Therefore if a
               man repeateth to him the triumph of the saints, <pb type="external" n="385"
               />immediately sleepiness and gaping lay hold upon him, and his whole body beareth the
               weight of listlessness, and he sheweth forth the signs of the deadness of his soul in
               the stretching of the limbs and in the turning about of his body; and if he is able
               to do so he goeth and he leaveth [the <pb n="368"/>narrator] and departeth, and if
               not, he immediately goeth to sleep where he is.</p>
            <p>And the soul of the glutton is like unto a dog, and rightly should he be called by
               the name thereof; for as a dog sleepeth through all things, and the converse and
               speech of men are alien things in his hearing, and only the sound of the platter and
               the sight of the food wake him up, even so also like him is the glutton sunk in the
               sleep of listless inattention, and every profitable discourse is accounted a
               superfluity unto him, and divine words flow upon his ear like water upon a rock. But
               let only a man mention before him one word of the belly, or say anything about meats,
               and immediately his soul rouseth up itself, and his thoughts are roused, and his body
               becometh straightway active, and he leapeth to the speech which he loveth, like a dog
               to the beckoning [of his master].</p>
            <p>Now therefore by such names as these is it right that the glutton should be called,
               that he may hear his names and be ashamed of his lust; for since he walloweth like a
               pig in the mire of lusts it is fitting for him to be called by its name. And because,
               like a dog which rouseth itself at the sound of the platter, discourses concerning
               the belly stir him up, he is fittingly also called <quote>dog;</quote> and because, like a beast
               to the manger, he runneth swiftly to the table, rightly is he called <quote>beast;</quote> and
               because, like a wild beast, he is wanting in all the conversations of wisdom <pb
                  type="external" n="386"/>and knowledge, and liveth unto his body only, he is
               rightly called by that name which is applicable to him by reason of his works. And if
               there existed other names which were more disgraceful and loathsome than these, they
               would be suitably applied unto him, without <pb n="369"/>causing any disgrace to the
               word which calleth him such like names, because his disgrace ariseth from himself.
               For as the names which are derived from certain things are applied unto the men who
               are called by the names which are derived from them, even so are the names of the
               glutton rightly derived from him, and he is properly called by the names which are
               characteristic of him. For the man who disgraceth himself, who shall honour? And the
               man who runneth after that which is despicable, who shall praise? And the man who
               gathereth together upon himself mockery and abominable speech, unto whom more than
               himself should his fair name be a care?</p>
            <p>Now therefore, even though I have spoken these things, it is right for me to speak
               further and make manifest the behaviour of gluttons that they may be recognized by
               all men of discretion, and be properly held in contempt, and be despised by all those
               who see them; and these are the manners and customs of him that is subject unto his
               belly. For man he hath no true love, and if by chance he doth love any one, it is the
               man who hath made himself a servant and a minister unto his lust that he loveth, and
               then only in proportion as he supplieth his pleasures. And if for any reason whatever
               it happeneth that this man changeth, and becometh inattentive, and diminisheth
               slightly his homage and service, straightway the glutton changeth also from his love,
               and his [former] praises of his friend turn <pb type="external" n="387"/>into blame,
               because his love is bound up in his belly. Every one who ministereth thereto is his
               friend, and whosoever payeth no heed thereto appeareth to him to be an enemy; and
               moreover, he seeketh and searcheth out the friends who will be of use unto him, <pb
                  n="370"/>and who will be able to minister unto his lust. The upright he loveth
               not, for the chaste he hath no affection, those who are burdened with labours are
               accounted stupid by him, the righteous he counteth as fools, and those who are
               constant in prayer are said by him to be without work. If he seeth a stranger he
               passeth by him as something alien, but he listeneth unto the mere report of any one
               of those who, he thinketh, can act as stewards unto his lust. He maketh himself ill
               by running after the desire of his lust, he beareth his belly upon his legs, and he
               goeth round about in every place. He maketh himself a friend unto the rich, and a
               slave and a servant unto nobles; conversation with them he considereth a matter of
               which to boast, and speech with them a thing of which to be proud. The report of the
               Gospel is not so dear unto him as the conversation of him who, he hopeth, hath laden
               himself, and hath brought that which will satisfy his lust. In very truth the feet of
               <persName>Abraham</persName>, laden with love, when he ran to the herd to bring a calf for the angels,
               were not as swift as those of the glutton when he runneth to meet him that hath
               brought him food; for his whole longing is to receive, and if it happen that he
               giveth, it is in order that more may be given back to him.</p>
            <p>And moreover he knoweth not how to gain a friend without the belly, for he would that
               that which he loveth should be loved also by others. If indignation rise up against
               him he thinketh that it may be quieted by a gift of the belly, and if he have
               provoked a man to wrath by his folly and envy, he hasteneth to appease him by a gift
               of food; <pb type="external" n="388"/>upon it he resteth his hope, and through it he
               thinketh that the <pb n="371"/>violence of his deeds <choice><sic>my be</sic><corr>may be</corr></choice> dissolved. The
               madman thinketh that every man is, like himself, bowed in subjection unto the god
               which he himself serveth, and that, like himself, his belly is his god. He waiteth
               anxiously to see a friend, but if, when he hath come, he hath brought nothing, the
               expectation of his soul and the appearance of his face are changed. The hand of the
               glutton is spread out to receive, but is tightly clenched against [giving] gifts, and
               if by chance he giveth, it is that he may provide material for himself and be
               abundantly rewarded. Where he knoweth that custom directeth the gift, and that
               according thereunto a gift will be given unto him, he hath no care to give largess,
               for he knoweth that although he may not pay it back, custom and habit will direct the
               gift [to be made]. But he maketh a gift where [he knoweth] that it will be returned,
               and he layeth the foundation of love where it hath not been laid before. And moreover
               he repeateth before new friends stories of the old ones, and he calleth to mind also
               the gifts which were given by them unto him, saying <quote>Such an one sent me such and
               such a thing, and such an one urged me, and although I did not wish it he forced me
               with [his] gifts, and I accepted,</quote> as if a man were to say, <quote>Hearken, and learn, and
               do thou likewise.</quote> He teacheth unto his new friends the doings of his old ones, and
               he maketh them disciples of the customs of the friends of olden time. He putteth
               aside all the discourses of others and bringeth his own to the front, and if it
               happen that some [other] matter be spoken of, or some matter of work, or of divine
               instruction, he skilfully bringeth it to an end and expelleth it, in order that he
               may bring into the midst the subject of the belly; for he liveth for nothing else,
                  <pb n="372"/>neither in his conversation, <pb type="external" n="389"/>nor in his
               speech, nor in his behaviour, nor in his works, nor in his meditations, nor in his
               thoughts.</p>
            <p>The glutton considereth the lust of the belly the greatest of all happiness, and all
               his questions are moved thereupon. He knoweth also the varieties of meats, and he is
               acquainted with the luxuries of different places, what garden produceth beautiful
               fruits, and what river hath fish of fine flavour, and who [best] knoweth how to cook
               and to prepare dainty foods; for these are his questions and his explanations, and
               [his] two testicles are more dear unto him than the Old and New Testaments. The
               mention of fast and vigil terrifieth him, and a long prayer is torture unto him; if
               he kneeleth down he murmureth, and if prayer be prolonged he roareth. He turneth the
               gaze of his eye at all times towards the windows, he considereth the course of the
               sun, he reckoneth the period thereof, and counteth the hours, and one day is
               accounted two in his sight. His period of prayer is short, but his time for eating is
               long, and he will undertake nothing, except only to satisfy the lusts of his belly.
               Everything is accounted superfluous by him, reading, instruction, fasting,
               abstinence, prayer, the singing of the Psalms, the [daily] service, and the
               <quote>Blessings;</quote> and if by chance or by the law of custom he performeth them it is
               through shamefacedness, and they are done by him listlessly and with the uttering of
               complaints. And what cause is not sufficient to make him cease from prayer? He will
               seek converse with men or any other matter which may happen, that he may be prevented
               from the service and the singing of the Psalms. The things of God are done by him
               negligently, but those which belong to his lust are done with all <pb type="external"
                  n="390"/>dili<pb n="373"/>gence and love. If he hath a small sore in his body he
               holdeth it to be a malignant ulcer, and if he be slightly disordered he accounteth it
               a severe and difficult illness. Everything which is profitable he layeth hold upon as
               a reason only to cease from [the service of] the Cause of his life, and he is earnest
               in everything except the serving of God.</p>
            <p>And also when the glutton hath no sickness, he planneth to appear to be sick, so that
               when he hath ceased from service and prayer he may not be greatly blamed. For he
               repeateth his illnesses before every man, and although the cause of his sickness is
               small and contemptible, he increaseth and magnifieth it, and he calleth God to
               witness, so that by this he may persuade those who listen to him that he is forcing
               himself to draw nigh unto the service of the monastery. The glutton acteth craftily
               concerning the health of his body, and although the cause which would seal up the
               fountain of his sicknesses is with him, that is, if he would curb his gluttony a
               little, he wandereth about and seeketh help outside him. If thou wert to advise him,
               saying, <quote>Diminish thy food a little, and keep thyself from oil and wine,</quote> he would
               look upon thee as one who hated his life, and would say unto thee, <quote>Sicknesses are
               better unto me than the restraint of the belly in anything; and I will take long
               illnesses upon me if only I may satisfy my lusts. If one wisheth me [to take]
               medicine to heal me [I will take it] with my food, but if not, it is better for me to
               eat than to become well.</quote> The glutton hath many carnal friends, whereby the needs of
               his lust may be gathered together unto him from all sides; he is crafty and skilful
               in his planning, and he knoweth whom to chose and of whom to make <pb type="external"
                  n="391"/><pb n="374"/>friends. And, moreover, he is not persuaded accidentally to
               make unto himself friends among blessed men, or among those who are poor, or of those
               who endure labours, or of those who love excellence, or of any one of those who
               possess the knowledge of <persName>Christ</persName>, neither can he be entreated to become loving unto
               them either in fact (?) or in name; and not only is he thus, but he is their secret
               enemy, for by their appearance, and speech, and works, they rebuke his gluttony, and
               for this reason he hateth and abominateth them.</p>
            <p>And if thou seest the glutton doing honour unto one of the wise, or unto one of the
               righteous, he doeth this only in form, that he may not be blamed by the believing men
               who love the things that are good, and also that he may quiet the murmuring of the
               many against him, and turn away from him the force of the zeal of those who honour
               what is good. If he seeth one of those who are young in their discipleship clothed in
               the discretion of the zeal of faith, like an indulgent man he would make him to cease
               therefrom, and he counselleth him as one who loveth him, saying, <quote>Be quiet, and do
               not disgrace thy kin, and forsake not thy life of tranquillity. Be thou silent, and
               behold, thou wilt be beloved. Occupy thyself in fasting and prayer only, and draw not
               nigh unto that which is not suitable unto thee.</quote> And he giveth the disciple this
               counsel that he may quiet his zeal, and not because he delighteth in the service of
               that which is good. And when he hath brought him down from the virtue of a man
               standing up to fight for God's sake, he beginneth also to overthrow the good habits
               which follow upon this, that is to say, the severity of labours and afflictions <pb
                  type="external" n="392"/>for God's sake, and the fastings of the ascetic, and <pb
                  n="375"/>protracted prayers, saying, <quote>These are unnecessary; a man should cleanse
               his soul and possess a good conscience;</quote> For he layeth hold upon a reason [to set
               before] the things of the inner man that he may destroy its outward acts, and he
               would justify himself by the belief that such things are unnecessary, because his
               laxity rebuketh his outward works. Where it is not easy for the children of men to
               see, he maketh himself a righteous man, and where afflictions and labours are seen,
               he maketh plans to hide them, and giveth concerning them other explanations. <quote>Our God
               doth not require from us,</quote> he is wont to say, <quote>that a man should kill himself, and
               afflict his body beyond measure, but only that we should be righteous in our souls,
               and that our thoughts may be cleansed from wickedness;</quote> and while the life of the
               wretched man is upon a lower grade than that of the beasts, like a perfect man he
               speaketh of spiritual things. His discoursings about his manner of life are long, and
               if he heareth a word from a book which may be of use to him, he layeth hold upon it
               with all diligence, in order that he may make use thereof in the season of strife,
               when he wageth war with his speech against those who rebuke his gluttony. When he
               wisheth to eat everything, and not to restrain himself by forbearance from any meat,
               he beginneth to repeat that which was written by <persName>our Lord</persName>, <quote>It is not that which
               goeth into a man which defileth him;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n375-1"/> for his ear is only pierced to hear
               such things as can be thought to support his lust, and in the face of the hearing of
               other things he shutteth the door of his attention. For he is not willing to hearken
               unto the <pb n="376"/>other verse which saith, <quote>Whosoever wisheth to be My disciple,
                  <pb type="external" n="393"/>let him deny himself, and take up his cross and
               follow Me;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-1"/> nor unto the other which saith, <quote>Whosoever wisheth to make his
               life to live shall destroy it,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-2"/> nor that which He spake unto His disciples,
               saying, <quote>In the world ye shall have tribulations;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-3"/> nor the words, <quote>When the
               Bridegroom shall be taken from the children of the bridechamber, then shall ye
               fast.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-4"/> And therefore [he would remember the passage concerning] the eating
               of <persName>our Lord</persName>, where it is written of Him that, <quote>He made the festival, and ate the
               passover;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-5"/> or where it is said that, <quote>They set before Him a piece of broiled
               fish and [a piece] of honeycomb;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-6"/> or where again it is written, <quote>They had
               fishes and bread.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-7"/> And these and such like things doth the glutton bring
               forward as proofs when he wisheth to eat everything freely, and the rule of the
               freedom of <persName>Christ</persName>, Who like God was above laws and commandments, doth he set forth
               to be a stumbling-block to his life, and he understandeth not the reason of that rule
               and conduct, and he perceiveth not that other types were inscribed therein. And
               again, when the <persName>Apostle Paul</persName> is read, and he heareth from him, <quote>Everything which
               was created by God is holy, and nothing is to be rejected if it be received with
               thanksgiving; for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-8"/> or
               another verse, <quote>The belly for meats, and meats for the belly;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n376-9"/> or that also
               which he spake, </p>
            <pb n="377"/>
            <p><quote>Let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n377-1"/> And in the other things
               like unto these which are written in the doctrine of <persName>Paul</persName>, <pb type="external"
                  n="394"/>the fool rejoiceth, and receiveth them gladly, without understanding the
               reason of the words.</p>
            <p>And the glutton is not pleased to hear the other things which have been written by
               <persName>Paul</persName> upon fortitude and asceticism, either when he recounteth his numerous
               fastings, or when he crieth out to his disciples, saying, <quote>Ye are dead unto the
               world,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n377-2"/> or when he writeth, <quote>It is good for [a man] not to eat flesh, and
               not to drink wine,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n377-3"/> or his exhortation, <quote>Through many tribulations it is
               meet for a man to enter into the kingdom of God,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n377-4"/> or his saying, <quote>God shall
               bring both the belly and the food to nought;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n377-5"/> and the reading of these and
               such like passages the glutton considereth unnecessary, and he is not pleased even to
               hear them.</p>
            <p>Now therefore in this manner standeth the life of him that loveth lusts, and as the
               remembrance of God is high unto the perfect, even so also is nigh unto him at all
               times the care for his belly. He singeth songs thereto, and meditateth upon it in his
               prayer and praise, his memory is burdened [therewith] at all seasons, and upon it he
               thinketh continually, because outside it he hath no other life; the memory thereof
               maketh his prayers light, and his constant thinking thereupon bringeth to nought in
               him all right and proper things. The glutton hath no seasons set apart for eating,
               but he eateth by day and by night, and when he eateth not he still eateth. </p>
            <pb n="378"/>
            <p>For thou must not consider that the times when he eateth are once or twice, but mark
               carefully that it is his care [to eat] at all seasons throughout the night and day,
                  <pb type="external" n="395"/>and when his body eateth not his thought eateth. And
               he hath not even, like the beasts, times set apart for eating, for although the beast
               eateth at all seasons, and hath no limit to its eating throughout the night and day,
               yet it doth not meditate upon its meat at all seasons; but the glutton eateth at all
               seasons because he thinketh about his belly always, and therefore, even when he
               sleepeth it appeareth to him in his dreams that he is eating. Shamefacedness is
               removed from before the eyes of the glutton, because he hath endowed his face with
               impudence so that he may not be ashamed. He heareth the mockery of himself and is
               silent, and he heareth disgraceful words spoken of him, but he taketh them not to
               heart; for the love of his belly overcometh him, and in spite of all the blows which
               beat upon him he is empty of spiritual virtues, that is to say, he knoweth not even
               that they exist. He chooseth things which inflame him mightily, he seeketh purified
               wines, and he asketh for tasty meats. He hath no work in the world save this, and
               however much we were to describe him he would not cease from his lax habits; but in
               the things which we have spoken we have given a little example of his lax ways,
               wherefrom those who see him may recognize him.</p>
            <p>Do thou then, O brave disciple, flee from such an example as this, and become not lax
               in thy strenuous rule of life through the sight of him. Thou thyself must know unto
               what thou hast become a disciple, and thy discipleship itself must be unto thee the
               cause of thy <pb n="379"/>course; be not like unto that contemptible man, but emulate
               with success the brave. Let not the man who is a counterpart of the beasts be an
               example unto thee, and thou shalt not consider it good for a man to eat, and to
               drink, and to satisfy his lusts, but shalt consider it an evil which is worse than
               all other evils. Hear also the words <pb type="external" n="396"/>of the prophecy,
               and the <quote>Woe</quote> which was proclaimed for gluttons, <quote>Woe unto those who rise up early in
               the morning and pursue strong drink, and who tarry long [over it] in the evening
               while wine inflameth them. With harps, and stringed instruments, and drums, and
               tabrets, they drink wine, and the works of God they understand not.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n379-1"/> And
               behold, the Spirit also hath taught thee that the man who ministereth unto his lusts
               is unable to understand the works of God. For as in our sleep we are not able to
               speak and to act as living beings who are awake, even so the man who is sunk in the
               sleep of lusts cannot understand the living works of God, neither doth he know how to
               contemplate His government, nor to wonder at the various forms of His dispensation;
               and he knoweth not admiration of the majesty of God, nor is he awake unto the
               knowledge of Him, nor is he ready to respond unto His wisdom. For whosoever is sunk
               in the slumber of lust perceiveth not these things, because the remembrance of these
               things belongeth unto those who are awake and living. And blessedness is ascribed
               unto the man who understandeth these things. For if unto those who eat, and drink,
               and who do not understand the works of God <quote>Woe</quote> be given, contrariwise <quote>Blessing</quote> is
               ascribed unto those <pb n="380"/>who are abstinent and self-denying, and who at all
               times meditate upon the works of God.</p>
            <p>Do thou then, O disciple, so run that thou mayest be worthy of blessing, and flee
               from the woe which is promised unto gluttons. And let those who are strenuous be unto
               thee an example for good, and not those who are fallen low, and those who fast
               instead of those who devour food, and those who lead ascetic lives instead of
               gluttons, and those who deny themselves instead of those who gorge, and those who
               serve God instead of those who serve their belly, and those who have fortitude
               instead of those who are slack, and the good instead of the bad; for <pb
                  type="external" n="397"/>good men are not wanting in the world to be an example
               unto thee of that which is good, and let us be like unto them and not unto the
               wicked. Thou shalt not examine closely those who stand beneath thee, but lift up
               thine eyes, and look at those who are greater than thou, and go up unto them; for as
               it is with matters of this world, every man choosing things which are great, even so
               is it with these divine things, and let us choose for ourselves that which is great
               and sublime. Now there is no man in the world who loveth poverty more than riches,
               but every man seeketh to be excused therefrom, and he followeth after riches, and he
               fleeth from pains, and he runneth after the health of the body. So likewise let us
               pursue the things of the spirit, and let us love the riches of fortitude, and not the
               poverty of gluttony, and let us love the healing of our soul and of our thoughts more
               than the sicknesses of the lusts; for the soul which ministereth unto lusts is always
               a diseased thing, and it hath no power over its spiritual strength and healing. For
               as whosoever is sick in his body hath not power over his <pb n="381"/>health to eat
               whatever he pleaseth, and he hath not power to do that which he wisheth, even so also
               the man whose soul is sick through gluttony neither hath power over the strength and
               healing of his soul, nor can he occupy himself in his actions with anything that he
               wisheth or seeketh to do. As the members of a sick man do not respond to him when he
               wisheth to move them for some purpose, so also the thoughts of a glutton do not
               respond to him when he wisheth to work with them something that is good; for all <pb
                  type="external" n="398"/>beautiful things are difficult unto the man who is
               subject unto his belly, because he is the slave of all lusts. If the passion of
               eating be moved in him he is not easily able to overcome it, because he himself is
               one in subjection, and if the lust of fornication stir in his members, or wrath, or
               anger, or envy, or wickedness, or any abominable passion, it is not easy for him to
               overcome it, because he is a slave and is in subjection unto them all, and they are
               to be subdued with difficulty, especially when they are many. And if, when one
               passion hath obtained power over our life, and it hath made us subject unto the
               labour of its bondage for a long time, it is difficult for us to overcome it, how
               much more shall we be overcome by many masters? For, as I have said, with gluttony
               all the other passions enter in, because it is the means of entrance for all
               lusts.</p>
            <p><choice><sic>"</sic><corr></corr></choice>Now <persName>our Redeemer</persName> said in His Gospel, <quote>Ye cannot serve God and mammon,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n381-1"/>
               and if in our subjection unto one lord—that is to say, unto mammon only—we are not
               able to serve also God therewith, how, when <pb n="382"/>the masters who have brought
               us into subjection are many, and each one of them leadeth us forcibly after his own
               will, can we serve God, Who will not accept from man the service of any other thing
               together with His own service? What then? And if each one of all these sins, which
               <choice><sic>collectwely</sic><corr>collectively</corr></choice> are contrary to the righteousness of God, is a drawback
               to its fellow in the service of Him, <pb type="external" n="399"/>how can the service
               of them collectively avoid being a hindrance to the keeping of the commandments of
               God? For they are different from one another in their actions, and the Will of God is
               contrary unto them all, and especially unto this lust of greediness, through which
               all other lusts are brought in and enter in.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, when a man hath been led into subjection to minister unto the service
               of his belly, he must give himself over to much toil that he may gather together
               [material] from all sides and bring it to [supply] its needs, for it not only seeketh
               to eat, but it also seeketh in what way it may eat; for if it rested only upon the
               satisfying of its need, the need of the belly could be satisfied with very little,
               and with common and ordinary things of low price. How many times have many men
               satisfied their wants with roots and herbs because they sought things for their need,
               and not for the satisfying of their lusts? And although God, like a rich Creator,
               gave in abundance everything for our need, yet it is right for us to consider His
               will, and to be guided accordingly, and therefore He multiplied in the world many
               kinds of dainty meats that they might be a furnace wherewith to test lust, and that
               the mind of the children of men might be tried as to what they lust for, and after
               what do they haste. For <pb n="383"/>where there is nothing to be lusted after the
               trial of lust existeth not; but it is right for the disciple to know himself, and he
               must not be subjected unto the lust of his body, <pb type="external" n="400"/>and he
               must not open the door to bring in upon himself beasts which destroy.</p>
            <p>For as when a strong door is closed fast, and evil beasts and noxious reptiles are
               kept outside of it, if by chance it be opened for any cause whatsoever, they are all
               found to come inside to injure the inhabitants of the place, even so also when the
               door of the lust of the belly is shut, all the murderous passions of lusts which
               destroy the soul are shut out, and they cannot enter in to bite and destroy the
               spiritual nature of the soul; but if through our slackness this door be opened before
               them, and our will doeth for the belly that which it desireth, immediately all
               wickednesses are gathered together and go in against our soul, and destroy therein
               all thoughts of excellence. For immediately thou openest this door, at once there
               entereth in the destroying beast of fornication, which devoureth and destroyeth body
               and soul together; and after it the lust of the belly, for which two things are
               necessary, the love of the belly and fornication, which is also born of lusts. And
               from the love of money is born trouble, either because we do not possess it, or
               because by chance we have lost that which we had collected, either in whole or in
               part; and from this is born in us also the passion of wrath, and we are provoked to
               anger and filled with wrath against those who do not give [unto us] that which,
               according to our opinion, they have wrested from us, or against those who do not obey
               and satisfy us with the service of our lives. And sometimes against slaves, and
               sometimes against <pb n="384"/>hirelings, and sometimes against those whom we hold
                  <pb type="external" n="401"/>in contempt and think lightly of, are we filled with
               anger and wrath through various causes which come upon us. And again we are filled
               with envy against those who are greater and richer than we are, and also with the
               love of plunder and defrauding, and how many times are we led even unto murder
               through this cause? And through riches arrogance also layeth hold upon us, and
               through the spectre of riches we lust for vain glory from the children of men, and
               therefrom we learn to receive calumnies from those who are inferior to ourselves, and
               we also calumniate those who are greater than ourselves. And from this we go forth
               unto falsehoods and oaths continually, and to blasphemy against God, and when the
               remembrance of the Judgment hath perished entirely from the soul, it henceforth doeth
               without fear all manner of wickedness. Now of these things and of those like unto
               them the primary cause is gluttony. For who is there that doth not know that the lust
               of fornication burneth in the body which eateth, and drinketh, and fareth
               luxuriously? And although it may not be ministered unto openly, and may not be
               apparent in deed unto the children of men, yet it inflameth the thoughts continually,
               and a man maketh plans and seeketh an exit for the fire which is in him; he lusteth
               after everything that is beautiful and he is tripped up by every form which is
               beautiful in appearance. For so long as the fire of lust is in his members his
               thoughts fly unto every face, and he committeth fornication secretly with every
               appearance. And although he fornicateth not outwardly, he fornicateth constantly
               inwardly, and although he is not an adulterer <pb n="385"/>in his body, he committeth
               adultery within himself at all seasons and at every hour. <pb type="external" n="402"
               />Now therefore meat and drink are the fuel of the fire of lust, and whosoever
               wisheth to quench in his members this fire which is hidden in them, must withhold
               this fuel from himself, and behold, it will be extinguished; for fasting, and
               abstinence, and self-denial are the water which quencheth the fire of lust. For what
               oil is to the fire wine is to lust, and as manure stimulateth the earth to bring
               forth fruit, even so doth the stinkingness of meats excite the members with
               abominable lusts. A superabundance of food is a covering of the understanding, and
               food, of and by itself, maketh dark the mind unto the thoughts of fornication, and
               concerning how much the troubling of lust disturbeth a pure mind there is no doubt
               whatever, but those know it especially who have experienced it. But before this lust,
               is the lust of the belly which submergeth the understanding, and it is the covering
               of the mind which seeth, and it is the thick darkness of the thoughts which possess
               the light of truth, for the stink of meats is the night of the enlightened mind. And
               as blacknesses and smoke darken pure and clean air, even so doth the stink of meat
               disturb the purity of the mind.</p>
            <p>Now therefore it is right for the disciple of <persName>Christ</persName> not only to excuse himself
               from dainty and costly meats, but also to eat sparingly of the commonest foods, for
               it is not because the meat is costly that it disturbeth the understanding and
               darkeneth the mind, but because of the abundance [that thou eatest], <pb
                  type="external" n="403"/>and this defect is found in respect of the commonest
               foods as well as of those that are costly. And well do the Holy Books <pb n="386"
               />admonish the children of men against the overfeeding of the belly in every place,
               for according to the teaching of <persName>Paul</persName>, <quote>Those who occupied themselves with meats
               were not benefited by them,</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n386-1"/> and not only were they deprived of any
               benefits, but they gathered together for their own persons loss and injury, but [he
               saith], <quote>Gluttons and drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of God;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n386-2"/> and
               read the passage, O disciple, and see unto what vices <persName>the Apostle</persName> compareth this
               wickedness—with soothsayers and destroyers, and other things like thereunto. And
               although the lust of the belly is not these, yet it leadeth unto them, for when the
               heart hath become gross through meats, straightway it driveth out from itself the
               remembrance of God, and when the memory of God hath departed from a man, what
               wickedness will he not do? and what iniquity will he be not moved to do? Even as also
               the prophet <persName>Moses</persName> hath taught us that through this cause the people forgot their
               God, and that through the lust of the belly they went forth unto idolatry, and from
               eating meat they were led into blasphemies, and from dainty foods they arrived at all
               wickedness, [saying,] <quote>He made him [i. e. <placeName>Israel</placeName>] to dwell upon the strength of the
               earth, and He made him to eat of the produce of the field. He made him to suck honey
               out of the rock, and oil out of the rock of flint: butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
               with the fat of <pb type="external" n="404"/>stalled beasts, rams, the offspring of
               ibexes, and kids, with the fat and fatty parts of wheat, and He made him to drink
               wine of the blood of grapes. And <placeName>Israel</placeName> waxed fat and kicked, he grew fat, and <pb
                  n="387"/>became thick, and acquired riches.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n387-1"/> And what happened unto him
               because of these things? and to what pass did he come by reason of these desirable
               things? and what country did he possess through these dainties with which he
               delighted himself? and into what <choice><sic>sicknessess</sic><corr>sicknesses</corr></choice> did the overfeeding of the
               belly, and the superfluity of meats cast him? Now <persName>Moses</persName> himself hath explained and
               made known unto us what the people obtained from these possessions: <quote>He forgot the
               God Who made him, and he blasphemed the Might which redeemed him. He moved Him to
               jealousy with strange things, and provoked Him to wrath with idols. They sacrificed
               unto devils which were not gods, and unto gods which they had not known.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n387-2"/>
               These are the things which the people obtained from dainty foods, and this is the
               inheritance of the worship of devils which they inherited from the overabundance of
               the body. And from the table which was rich in meats they were drawn unto the unclean
               tables of idols, and from dainty foods they went forth to cast stinking things before
               graven images, and through the lust which taketh away the strength from nature they
               came to unclean thoughts which are alien unto nature.</p>
            <p>Behold then, O disciple, and see how that people went from one thing to another, and
               uproot from thee patiently the root which putteth forth as a sprout the worship of
               idols, a root which having begun [to spring] from the belly cometh to an end in the
               worship of devils. The prophet doth not say unto thee simply that the people
               worshipped idols, but he first of all maketh thee to know the reason why they
               worshipped <pb n="388"/>[them]; and he doth not relate unto thee concerning the
               severe and difficult sickness until he hath informed thee of the cause of the
               sickness, and whence it came. <quote>He ate, <pb type="external" n="405"/>and drank, and
               fared luxuriously,</quote> hence he forgot God who made him; and because error entered in,
               it gave birth to abuse and blasphemies, hence <quote>he blasphemed the mighty One who
               redeemed him.</quote> And this was not sufficient for him, but he also made unto himself
               gods in opposition to God, and instead of One, he forged for himself many. <quote>He
               provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods, and he moved Him to wrath with idols.</quote>
               And together with the testimony of the Word we may also see from the fact itself how
               they came to offer praises before the calf in the wilderness, <quote>The people sat down to
               eat and to drink, and rose up to play;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n388-1"/> until food had entered in
               blasphemies did not go forth, and until wine had been poured into them they were not
               clothed with the fornication which is against God.</p>
            <p>These then are the injurious things which meat hath wrought, and who will not flee
               from the overabundance thereof? Whosoever hath determined to become corrupt will
               become a devourer, for the glutton taketh within himself thoughts of corruptness, and
               then he draweth nigh unto dainty meats. A man is led to become a servant unto his
               belly through the lust of the body, and it is manifest that the man who loveth lust
               is an enemy of the praise of <persName>Christ</persName>, for the lust of the body is opposed unto the
               lust of the spirit, and so long as the one liveth it is impossible for the other to
               live. From the time when the lust of <pb n="389"/>the body liveth in him, the lust of
               the spirit is dead in him, and as the body is deprived of all <pb type="external"
                  n="406"/>the things for which it lusteth when it becometh an alien unto its own
               life, even so the soul becometh an alien unto all good when the lust of the spirit is
               removed from it: for the lust of the spirit is the beginning of the ascent unto all
               excellent things, but the lust of the body is the entrance of all wickedness. For
               even if the lust of the belly did not impede us in any fair thing, it would be right
               and seemly for us to excuse ourselves therefrom, both for its own sake and because it
               might not make us like unto the beasts; but since it is the entrance of all vices,
               and the field which is wont to put forth as fruit brambles and briars, how much more
               should we do this? And if those who perform noble acts and deeds of the world, and
               those who wish to become famous in bodily skill sustain their lives with little food,
               how much more especially have spiritual athletes need thereof, in order that they may
               possess fortitude, and run the course of their labours. Now if the body itself the
               natural life of which which is sustained by food, layeth hold upon the habit of
               abstinence and self-denial when it wisheth to be famous in some feat of bodily skill,
               how much more especially hath that soul, which is wont to diminish from the weight of
               the body, and which maketh it active and obedient unto the soul which dwelleth
               therein, need of abstinence and self-denial? So long as the body is heavy with the
               abundance of flesh, is it difficult for the soul to turn itself about, but when it
               becometh lighter and diminisheth through abstinence, the soul easily performeth
               therein <pb type="external" n="407"/>all its desires, and it refineth it by its
               lightness; for so <pb n="390"/>long as the body is heavy and gross it is contrary
               unto the soul, because the soul is a refined and rational thing. And in proportion as
               it loveth the celestial country which is suitable unto its spiritual nature, so also
               doth the body love the grossness of earth and the heaviness of the dust, and while
               the soul leapeth to mount upwards, the body through its weight inclineth to go
               downwards, and also to crawl about upon the ground of lusts like a reptile.</p>
            <p>The body which eateth overmuch maketh the soul an irrational thing, and it spoileth
               and carrieth away therefrom all the motions of wisdom, for the heart is the vessel of
               the discretion and intelligence of the soul, and when it hath become gross through
               the overabundance of meats, all the thoughts of the soul which are moved thereby
               become gross therewith. And because the fire which is mingled therein naturally
               becometh dead and cold, the heat of the knowledge of the soul also diminisheth, and
               the active movement of its thoughts ceaseth, because although the gift of rationality
               beginneth from the soul, yet its operation is made visible by the intervention of the
               members of the body, and all parts of its nature have need of all parts of the
               members of the body. And behold we see that when the soul wisheth to observe the
               world it looketh thereat through the eyes of the body, and when it wisheth to hear
               the voice of the body it receiveth it through the medium of the ears, or again if it
               seeketh to send without a word of its nature, it maketh it pass over to us by the
               tongue, the bridge of words; <pb type="external" n="408"/>and [to speak] briefly,
               whenever it wisheth to perceive anything of this world, by means of the senses of the
               body it goeth out or cometh in. But when it wisheth <pb n="391"/>to see the country
               of spiritual beings, or to hear the living words of their spirituality, or when it
               seeketh to look with the vision which is above nature, it hath no need whatever of
               the senses, nay it even sendeth them away, and alone, and with its own members, it
               moveth with the living motions which are above nature. Therefore as we have learnt
               that the soul hath need of the external senses, so also [is it] concerning the
               members which are within, by which it is moved in all its parts, whether to wisdom,
               or to intelligence, or to enlightenment, or to thoughts, or to discretion, or to
               understanding and knowledge, or to the fear of God; of all these, then, by means of
               the members, doth the soul make use, and in proportion as these are active, and the
               weight of meats is not laid upon them, and they are not troubled by the excessive
               smell of food, the soul worketh actively through them. And as a light which is
               mingled with another light, for by the admixture therewith the light shineth the more
               brightly, so also is the luminous soul mingled in the luminous members when they are
               active and free from the filth of meat; but if they are dense and heavy, they become
               like a dense body, and like a gross covering in front of its light, and instead of
               receiving help from them, they injure and impede the activity of its working. And
               those who scrutinize <choice><sic>subtilly</sic><corr>subtly</corr></choice> the knowledge of nature <pb type="external"
                  n="409"/>recognize these things and also others which are like unto them.</p>
            <p>Now therefore if thou, even thou, O disciple, desirest to be a participator in this
               natural knowledge, and to ascend from it unto the knowledge of the spirit, keep
               thyself from the weight of meats, and let the natural grossness of thy body be
               sufficient for thee, and do not make it more gross and heavy <pb n="392"/>with
               overmuch meat, even though for the sake of thy health thou wouldst eat a quantity—now
               the man who thinketh thus erreth greatly—for an overabundance of food doth not give
               health but produceth pains and sicknesses in the body, and it only maketh healthy the
               body of lust. And as all the members become sick, and soft, and useless, even so
               becometh strong and sound the lust for phantasms in the body and soul, and together
               with the lust folly also groweth strong, for the lust of the belly increaseth this
               abominable passion of folly more than all other lusts, for folly is the thick
               darkness of the soul, even also as knowledge is the light of nature. And as a lamp is
               extinguished in winds or storms, or becometh dim and sheddeth its light dimly in a
               house wherein the air is damp and heavy, so also doth the light of the knowledge of
               the soul become dark in the heart which is black through the weight and moisture of
               meats. And behold also the rays of the sun, the light of which is established in its
               own nature, and not by absorption from other substances like a lamp, become dark in
               an atmosphere which is troubled and disturbed, <pb type="external" n="410"/>and
               although in the constitution of its sphere it is light with the riches of its
               fulness, yet to the body of [this] world it is black and dark. And thus also must
               thou think concerning the soul, in which is gathered together the light of knowledge
               in the manner in which the natural light [is gathered together] in the sphere of the
               sun and when the heart becomes dull (or, cloudy) like the atmosphere, then all the
               members which are therein are disturbed by the smoke of meat, and the rays of the
               knowledge of the soul are prevented from shedding their light fully unto all the
               parts of the body, and all <pb n="393"/>the motions of a man, whether of the external
               senses, or whether of the internal members, move stupidly and confusedly.</p>
            <p>Now the knowledge of the soul is the hidden rudder of the whole body, which keepeth
               the eye in chasteness, [that is to say,] in orderliness, and the ear in vigilance,
               and the hand in watchfulness, and the tongue in correct balance, and the feet in a
               prudent gait; and as the charioteer [holdeth] the bridles of his steeds, even so doth
               the soul hold the reins of knowledge, and it guideth all the senses, and as the
               charioteer directeth his steeds so also doth the soul order the senses, and rule the
               inner members, and this good thing which is the light of the body, and the order of
               all the members, perisheth through gluttony in the man who is not vigilant and
               heedful. Let the disciple of <persName>Christ</persName> then flee from this foolish passion, and let
               him not be a slave unto his belly. For if we are not able to serve at one time both
               God and mammon, <pb type="external" n="411"/>according to the word of <persName>Christ</persName>, it is
               evident that we cannot [serve] both the belly and God, for it also was called <quote>god</quote>
               after the manner of mammon, and as <persName>Jesus</persName> called mammon <quote>master,</quote> even so also did
               <persName>His Apostle</persName> call the belly god [in the words,] <quote>Whose god is their belly, and whose
               glory their shame.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n393-1"/> And the word of God mocketh those who lay fast hold upon
               their art, who have hired themselves unto <persName>Christ</persName> for their belly's sake and not
               because of love for Him, even as there are also today many who are clothed with the
               precious garb of discipleship, and who feign to be teachers and good servants of God,
               not for love's sake, nor through <pb n="394"/>discretion and fear, but only that they
               may minister unto their belly, which they have made a god unto themselves, and unto
               which they minister.</p>
            <p>Now <persName>the Apostle of God</persName> teacheth us plainly that the heaviness of the belly boweth
               down the gaze of the soul from heaven to earth, saying, <quote>Their whole mind is [set]
               upon earth.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n394-1"/> And he set forth first the words, <quote>Whose god is their belly,
               and whose glory their shame,</quote> and afterwards he said, <quote>Their whole mind is [set] upon
               earth,</quote> in order that he might make known that the reason why they were fettered unto
               earth, and why their mind was contaminated with the dust, was because they possessed
               the lust of the belly; and as the lust thereof chained them to the earth, even so
               also will it bind whosoever ministereth thereunto. For in what particular is the man
               who is befouled with the lusts of the belly different from the worms which crawl
               about in filth, or from the swine which wallow <pb type="external" n="412"/>in the
               mire? For in this case also the service of this loathsome lust must needs be called
               loathsomeness, and filth, and mire, and shame, and if <persName>Paul</persName> called it so, how can we
               help calling it so likewise?</p>
            <p>Now therefore we can see that the lust of the belly is the beginning of all
               wickedness, and that it leadeth us unto the ruin which [befell] <persName>Adam</persName>. For through
               it he transgressed the commandment of God, and through it he despised and cast away
               the law which [He had set] for him, and <persName>the Calumniator</persName> took it that it might be a
               helpmeet unto him, because he saw that it was the most powerful of all lusts, and
               that thereby he would be able to enter into him with all other wickedness. And <persName>the
               Enemy</persName> <pb n="395"/>did not contend against the heads of our race with fornication,
               or with avarice, or with vain-glory, or with the adornment of apparel, or with envy
               and pride, or with any of the other passions, but only with the lust of the belly,
               because he saw that it was capable of becoming a leader of all the lusts; for <persName>the
               Tempter</persName> was crafty, and he saw which passion was the strongest and foremost in us,
               and he drew nigh thereunto, and stimulated it, and after that he sowed the seeds of
               laxity, and after that the seeds of lust, and then fornication also entered in, for
               immediately <quote>they had eaten, the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
               they were naked.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n395-1"/> And it is evident that it was because the lust for
               connexion moved in the members of union, that they also perceived [that they were
               naked], and were ashamed at the sight of each other, for until food had gone into
               them <pb type="external" n="413"/>lust was not stirred up, and until lust had been
               stirred up shame and fear did not rule [over them].</p>
            <p>Behold, then, the beginning of shame is the lust of the belly, and well hath <persName>the
               blessed Apostle</persName> also called it thus, saying, <quote>The woman saw that the tree was fair,
               and that it was a thing for which the eyes lusted, and that it was desirable to look
               upon; and she took of its fruit, and she ate and gave also to her husband with her,
               and he did eat.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n395-2"/> Thus thou mayest see that the lust of the belly was the
               beginning of their common sin, and of the first transgression of the commandment, and
               that thereby all sins and all punishments were brought in and came upon us; for as
               envy was the beginning of wickedness with <persName>Satan</persName>, so also was the belly the
               beginning of the <pb n="396"/>transgression of the commandment with the house of
               <persName>Adam</persName>. And through it sins came in, and through it all penalties followed; it was
               the beginning of pains and sicknesses, through it the pains of childbirth entered in,
               through it was the earth cursed, and it brought forth briars and brambles, it hath
               made us aliens from the pleasures of Paradise, it hath cast us out as it were into
               exile in a cursed land, through it we have become slaves unto devils, through its
               dominion over us we serve in the bondage of <persName>Satan</persName>, through it evil spirits sport
               with us and laugh at us, it hath brought in death which dissolveth and scattereth our
               frames, through it this fair and beautiful image hath been made hideous and
               loathsome, it hath fed us with the bread of pain, and it hath collected for us food
               by the sweat of our face. Now the lust of the belly is a senseless and blind thing.
               It sought to eat, and yet was deprived of food; it lusted after pleasures, and
               destroyed the gratification and delight <pb type="external" n="414"/>of Paradise, for
               though lusting to eat, it knew not how to eat; it possessed not patience, for the
               nature of this lust is to be hasty and impatient, and it made haste and plucked one
               fruit, and was henceforth deprived of the table which was full of all the luxuries of
               Paradise.</p>
            <p>Now therefore let that lust which came unto <persName>Adam</persName> be a type of that which cometh to
               us, for as they, by of the eating of one fruit, were deprived of the food of the
               whole garden, even so also will one loaded table deprive us of the table of the
               kingdom of heaven. For as long as the belly is full, and is weighted with an
               abundance of meats, the soul is useless for the remembrance of the blessings which
               are about to come, and so long as the eye is fixed intently <pb n="397"/>upon these
               meats, and it lusteth for them, the eye of the mind turneth away from the sight of
               spiritual delights. What then? If <persName>Adam</persName>, because he lusted for one fruit, lost the
               whole of Paradise, how can the man who is laden with the lust of many meats help
               being deprived of the table of the kingdom? For, because of his having eaten, <persName>Adam</persName>
               lost Paradise, and inherited death with all its curses. <persName>Esau</persName>, because of his meat,
               cast away the birthright together with the blessings,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-1"/> and he became a slave
               unto sin, and one who was subject under the hand of his brother. The people [of
               <placeName>Israel</placeName>], because of their meat, forgot God, and instead of God, worshipped the
               similitude of a dumb animal; and again, because of their meat, the wrath of God <pb
                  type="external" n="415"/>went up against them;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-2"/> and again, because of
               their meat, they were led into the fornication with the Midianites, through which the
               pestilence had dominion over them suddenly, for it is written, <quote>While the flesh was
               yet between their teeth the anger of God went up against them.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-3"/> And again,
               through meat and luxuries the Sodomites also were polluted with an unclean matter,
               and pleasures and the love of the belly brought them unto that limitless wickedness,
               even as the prophet of God maketh known concerning them, <quote>This was the iniquity of
               thy luxurious sister <placeName>Sodom</placeName>, who was satisfied with bread, and dwelt at
               ease;</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n397-4"/> for by reason of being filled with bread, and delicacies they
               polluted themselves with unnatural lust. Let these things and others which are like
               unto them be in thy remembrance, O thou that wishest to <pb n="398"/>travel in the
               path of heaven, and cut off and cast away from thee the fettering weight of the
               belly, which sinketh the soul into the depths of wickedness like a millstone in the
               sea. And do not imagine that [the lust for] dainty meats only is accounted gluttony,
               for behold, the gluttony of <persName>Esau</persName> was made manifest through a mess of pottage, and
               [it consisteth not] in flesh overmuch, nor in wine overmuch, nor in any other
               preparation of meats; for it was only because [<persName>Esau</persName>] desired greedily a mess of
               pottage, that the word of God rejected him, and cast him away. In the meat which thou
               hast nigh unto thee shew thy forbearance, and contend with that which is near thee,
               and let there be war with thee against the contemptible and despicable things which
               are set before thee, lest thou make use of them for the filling of thy belly [only];
               for no man <pb type="external" n="416"/>leaveth the obstacles which are near and
               fighteth with those which are afar off, and no man leaveth the sickness which is at
               hand and which causeth him pain, and bringeth healing unto that which hath not yet
               appeared. And since the dainty meats, of which the rich and noble men of the world
               make use, are not nigh unto thee, forbear from the inferior kinds which are set
               before thee, and if thou canst conquer [the lust] for meats which are common thou
               mayest believe that thou wilt also be the conqueror over the lust for those which are
               more dainty, and that thou wilt gain the victory over those which are of great
               price.</p>
            <p>The full belly produceth not pure prayer, and the stomach which is inflated with too
               much food giveth not forth wakeful melody. Now if its own loss only were found in
               overfilling the belly, even though it would be blameworthy, it would not perchance be
                  <pb n="399"/>over-wicked to palliate it, but because of the other wickednesses
               which spring therefrom, it is right for the disciple that he should take heed
               thereunto. The sleep of the overeater is much, his dreams are disturbed, his visions
               are confused, the flow of his lust is copious, and his sleep is deep but not healthy.
               If he standeth up to sing a psalm, thou mayest consider that he standeth not up, for
               as he sinketh down upon his bed, even so doth he sink down in his standing up; he
               throweth himself against the walls, he layeth hold of the things which hang down, he
               supporteth himself upon sticks that they may bear with him his heavy body, that is to
               say, that they may carry with him the weight of the meats which he beareth. And if it
               happen that he beginneth and endeth his service, he perceiveth not where he is, for
               although many voices cry in his ears he overcometh them by the depth of his sleep;
                  <pb type="external" n="417"/>his ear is closed by the weight of meats, his eye
               turneth away through sleepiness, and his whole body is weaned and exhausted, because
               he doth not eat in moderation. The living stand by his side, and look upon him as
               dead, and those who are awake see him, and they laugh and mock after his own manner.
               He knoweth not which psalm is being sung, he is wrathful against the man who waketh
               him up, and he is filled with anger and threatenings against whomsoever rouseth him
               from his deep slumber. It happeneth too that he falleth down while he standeth, and
               through the noise of his fall he disturbeth the service, and in the hour of quietness
               he maketh tumult, and at the season when God is hymned by the living and by the
               Watchers, he standeth before Him like a soulless corpse. And if one should say, <quote>Is
               he not ashamed, and is he not brought to the blush?</quote> [I say,] how <pb n="400"/>can
               the man, who doth not even know where he is, be ashamed? He despiseth God in his
               standing up, he casteth [looks of] hatred upon those who behold him, he heapeth
               reproaches also upon those who wake him up, he maketh himself a cause of falling and
               stumbling unto those who stand by his side, who leave off singing to speak about him,
               and who are irritated at the sight of the depth of sleep into which he hath fallen;
               for if the glutton sleepeth, he is drowned in sleep, and if he be awakened he
               sleepeth, and if he singeth he is dumb, and if he standeth up, he falleth prone.</p>
            <p>Observe then these defects, O thou that lovest spiritual excellence, and excuse
               thyself from this wickedness, that thou mayest not forget God and thine own self
               thereby, and thy discernment be darkened against all that is seemly; and with these
               remember also that which was spoken by the <persName>prophet Moses</persName> to the Jews, saying, <quote>Take
               heed when <pb type="external" n="418"/>thou eatest, and art satisfied, lest thou
               forget the Lord thy God who brought thee forth out of the land of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n400-1"/>
               And behold the Spirit of God hath taught thee openly that error is born of fulness of
               food, and that, when a man hath forgotten God, he marcheth fearlessly into all
               wickedness, and associateth himself with all evils. For as the sight of a stern
               master is to riotous slaves, even so is the remembrance of God [unto the soul]; for
               it maketh the tumultuousness of the thoughts shamefaced, and immediately the thought
               of Him falleth into the mind all the perturbed thoughts hasten to put themselves in
               the order of fear, and the soul becometh suddenly a peaceful house, an ordered <pb
                  n="401"/>temple, a pure dwelling, and a holy mansion of the Trinity. Whosoever
               then wisheth to travel along the path of heaven should unfasten the shackles of lusts
               from his feet, and should remove every weight from the wings of his mind, in order
               that his person may travel easily towards greatness, and may hear the promise of the
               holy man <persName>Paul</persName>, who taught and admonished us, saying, <quote>Take ye heed lest there be
               among you any man who is wanton or slack like <persName>Esau</persName>, who for one [mess of] meat sold
               his birthright; for also when he afterwards desired to inherit the blessings, he was
               rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it with
               tears.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n401-1"/></p>
            <p>Let then these remembrances be unto thee, [O disciple,] and let such testimonies as
               these be written in thy heart. Let us be active, that we may become spiritual beings;
               let us shut the door of the lust of the belly, that all wickedness may be shut
               outside; let us put to death in us the lust of the body, that the lust of the spirit
               may live in our soul; let us diminish by patience <pb type="external" n="419"/>also
               the wants of our life, that we may be worthy by Grace of the life of glory; let us
               deny the foolish mistress, that we may confess fully the Holy and Eternal One; let us
               free our members from weight, that we may make our members light by pure prayer; let
               us cast out the smoke of lust, that the eye of our soul may be clear for the sight of
               knowledge; let us not lust after the loaded table and abundance of meats, that the
               table of the kingdom may receive us like famished folk; let us despise and reject the
               health of the body, that we may be able to obtain the health <pb n="402"/>of the
               hidden man; let not the fear of sickness through [lack of] food fight against us lest
               wounds increase in our soul thereby; let us give thanks unto the Provider for little
               food, that it may be seen that we are His sons and not slaves in the hire of the
               belly; let us overcome patiently the first lust, that we may thereby gain strength to
               vanquish all [other] lusts; let us say unto each other that which hath been said unto
               us by <persName>the Apostle</persName>, <quote>The belly for meats, and meats for the belly, but God will
               bring them both to nought.</quote><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n402-1"/> The body then is not for fornication, but for
               the Lord, and the Lord for the body, to Whom be glory from us all for ever. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here endeth the First Discourse on the lust of the belly by the holy man
               <persName>Philoxenus</persName>, Bishop of <placeName>Mabbôgh</placeName>.</p>
