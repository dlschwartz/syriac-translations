            <head>An Epistle of <persName>Constantine</persName> the King summoning the Bishops from <placeName>Ancyra</placeName> to Nice.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n1"/></head>
            <p>That there is nothing more honourable in my sight than religion, is, I believe,
               manifest to every man. Now because the Synod of Bishops at Ancyra, of Galatia,
               consented formerly that it should be so<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n2"/>, it hath seemed to us now on many accounts,
               that it would be well for it to be assembled at Nice, a city of Bithynia, because the
               Bishops of Italy, and of the rest of the countries of Europe are coming, and because of
               the excellent temperature of the air<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n3"/>, and because I shall be at hand as a spectator and
               participator of what is done. Wherefore, I signify to you, my beloved brethren, that ye
               all of you promptly assemble at the city I spoke of, that is at Nice. Let every one of
               you, therefore, diligently inquire into that which is profitable, in order that, as I before
               said, without any delay we may speedily come to be a present spectator of those things
               which are done by the same. God keep you, my beloved brethren.</p>

            <head>Injunction of the same Constantine, against the Arians.
               Constantine the King to the Bishops and nations everywhere.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n4"/></head>
            <p>Inasmuch as Arius imitates the evil and the wicked, it is justice that like them he
               should be rebuked and rejected. As therefore, Porphyry, who was an enemy of religion,
               and wrote wicked and lawless writings against the religion of Christians, found the
               reward which was meet for him, that he might be a reproach in all generations after,
               because he fully and insatiably used base fame; so that on this account even his writings
               may be justly destroyed: so also now it hath seemed fit that Arius and the holders of
               his opinion, should be all called Porphyrians, that he may bear the name of those whose
               evil ways he imitates: and not only this, but also that all the writings of Arius, wherever
               found, should be delivered up to be burnt with fire, in order that not only his wicked and
               evil doctrine may perish, but also that the memorial of himself and of his doctrine may
               be blotted out, that by no means there may remain to him any remembrance in the
               <pb n="22"/>world. And this also I ordain, that if any one should be detected secreting any writing
               composed by Arius, and should not straightway deliver up and burn it with fire, his
               punishment shall be death; for as soon as he is caught in this, he shall suffer capital
               punishment by beheading, without delay.</p>

            <head>A confession of faith which was made at Nicea, a city of Bithynia, in the consulate 
               of Paulinus and Julianus, in the year 373 of the reckoning of the Antiochians, 
               after Antiochus; and in the year 636 of the reckoning of the Macedonians,
               after Alexander, in the month Haziran, on the 19th of it; and on the 13th of

            <p>I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of all things, visible and invisible:
               And in one Lord Jesus Christ<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n6"/> the Son of God, who was begotten of the Father, only
               begotten. Now he is of the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very
               God of very God, who was begotten and not made; of the same substance as the Father;
               by whose hand all things were made which are in heaven and in earth; who for us men
               and for our salvation, came down and became incarnate, and was made man, and suffered,
               and rose the third day, and ascended to heaven, and cometh to judge the living and the
               dead And in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Now those who say that once he was not, and that he was not before he was begotten, 
               or that he was from nothing, or say that he was of another substance or essence,
               or think the Son of God changeable or mutable, these the Catholic and Apostolic Church
               anathematizes.</p>

            <p>Ecclesiastical Canons of the great and holy Synod of 318 Bishops, which was
               assembled at Nicea, a city of Bithynia, and constituted those things which are written

            <p>There are contained in this book 193 canons which were drawn up in eight different
               Synods, and were translated from Greek into Syriac, carefully and clearly, in the city of

            <p>Again, a history of these Synods. Now the Synod of Nicea was assembled in the
               days of Constantine the Great; and its chiefs were Alexander, Archbishop of Alexandria ;
               and in the place of the papa of Rome, Vinto and Vicentius, presbyters of Rome.</p>

            <p>Again: Now the Synod of Nicea was assembled because of the affairs of wicked
               Arius, who alienated the Son from the nature of the Father; and in that he was begotten
               of the Father, they called him 'made,' and ' a creature,' and (said) that he was not of
               the same nature as the Father.</p>

            <p>Let the ancient customs be kept in Egypt, and in Libya, and in Pentapolis, that the
               Bishop of Alexandria should have power over all these; because to him of Rome also,
               this custom obtains. And so also in Antioch, and in the other provinces, let the primacy
               be maintained in the churches. Now let this be everywhere known, that if a man should
               be made a bishop without the consent or permission of the Metropolitan, the great Synod
               determines, that he shall not be a bishop. But if two or three for their contentiousness
               should oppose an election common to all of them, when it is orderly, and according to
               the ecclesiastical canon, let the opinion of the majority obtain and stand.</p>

            <head>Addenda: Pseudo-Athanasian and Nicene Creeds.</head>
            <p>It may not be uninteresting to some, if we append here a translation of two Creeds,
               the former professing to be by Athanasius, and the latter given as the Nicene Creed. They are
               from a Syriac MS. in the British Museum, No. 12,156, which was written in A.D. 562, and is
               the depository of many curious relics. The volume contains among other things the treatise of
               Timothy of Alexandria against the Council of Chalcedon,' which includes a large number of
               extracts from the Fathers. The so-called Creed of Athanasius bears evident marks of a Monophysite 
               origin, and the so-called Nicene Creed is made out of the true Nicene and Constantinopolitan. 
               As I am not aware of their existence elsewhere, I give them a place here, among
               the very few Syriac fragments which I have been able to discover referring to the Council of
               Nice.</p>
            <div>
               <head>Creed of the blessed Athanasius, head of the bishops (Archbishop) of Alexandria, upon the
                  divine incarnation of God the Word, which consentsâ  to that of the holy Synod which was
                  in Nice.</head>
               <p>We confess the Son of God, who before the worlds was eternally begotten; who in the
                  end of the worlds was (born) of Mary in the flesh for our redemption, as the divine Apostle
                  teacheth, saying, <quote>Now when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son who was (born)
                     of a woman,</quote> and he was Son of God and God in the Spirit, but Son of Man in the flesh. The one
                  Son was not two natures, one which is to be worshipped, and another not to be worshipped, but
                  one nature of God the Word, who became incarnate, and is with his flesh, to be worshipped
                  with one worship: nor are there two Sons, one who is the Son of the true God and to be
                  worshipped, but the other from Mary, the Son of Man, and not to be worshipped, being Son
                  of God by grace as men also are: but he who was of God, and God as I said, is at once
                  Son of God and God; and he was not another who was also born of Mary in the flesh in the
                  last days. As also the angel said to Mary mother of God, when she asked, <quote>How shall this
                     be, for I know not a man?</quote>-<quote>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
                  Highest shall overshadow thee, and therefore that Holy One who shall be born of thee
                  shall be called the Son of God.</quote> He therefore that was born of the Virgin Mary was
                  by nature Son of God and the true God, and not by grace and communication. In the flesh
                  alone, he that was of Mary was Son of Man, but in the Spirit he was both Son of God
                  and God, who bore our sufferings, as it is written, <quote>Christ suffered for us in the flesh;</quote> and
                  again, <quote>For he that spared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all.</quote> For he continued
                  impassible and immutable in the divinity, as it is said by the prophet, <quote>I am God and I change
                  not,</quote> who died our death in the flesh for our sins, that he might remove death by death for us,
                  as the Apostle saith, <quote>Death is swallowed up in victory. O Death, where is thy victory? O
                  Grave, where is thy sting?</quote> And again, <quote>Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</quote>
                  Now he continued incomprehensible and immortal in death, in the divinity, according to the
                  impassible power of the Father, as Peter saith, <quote>It was not possible that he should be holden
                  of death.</quote> And he ascended to heaven and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, according
                  to his flesh (viz.), that of the Word, which went up from earth, as was said by David, <quote>The
                  Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</quote> which is affirmed of our Lord both by
                  him and by the Apostles. Now in the Divinity he is infinite, and every place is limited by him
                  <pb n="38"/>With the Father who is eternal he is a son of eternity (=eternal), according to the paternal
                  power which is ineffable, according to the teacher Paul, <quote>Christ the power of God, and Christ
                  the wisdom of God.</quote> And he cometh, being Son of God and God as is confessed, that he may
                  judge the living and the dead, as the Apostle saith, <quote>Who shall judge the hidden things of
                  darkness, and reveal the thoughts of the hearts: and he shall render glory and contempt to
                  every man as becometh him.</quote></p>
               <p>Now if a man teach other than these things from the divine Scriptures, saying that the
                  Son of God is one, and the Son of Man who was of Mary is another who was made a son by
                  grace as we are; so that there are two Sons, one by nature Son of God, who was of God, and
                  one by grace, the Son of Man who was of Mary; or if a man say that the flesh of our Lord is
                  from above, and not of the Virgin Mary; or that the Divinity partook of the flesh, or was confounded 
                  or commuted with it; or that the divinity of the Son was passible; or that the flesh of
                  our Lord is not to be worshipped, inasmuch as it is that of the Son of Man, and is not to be
                  worshipped as being the flesh of our Lord and our God: such a one the Holy and Catholic
                  church anathematizes, since the divine Apostle enjoins it, saying, <quote>If a man preach to you other
                  than ye have received, let him be anathema.</quote></p>

               <head>Confession of Faith of the great and holy Synod of 318 blessed Fathers at Nice.</head>
               <p>We believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and of earth, and of all things
                  visible and invisible:</p>
               <p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was begotten of the Father, the only
                  begotten. Now he is of the Substance of the Father; God of God; Light of Light; Very
                  God of Very God; who was begotten and not made; of the same substance as the Father; by
                  whom all things were made which are in heaven and which are on earth; who for us men and
                  for our redemption, came down and became incarnate, and became man, and suffered, and rose
                  the third day and he ascended to heaven, and shall come to judge the living and the dead:</p>
               <p>And in the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Now those who say that once he was not, and that he was not before he was begotten, or
                  that he was from nothing, or say that he was of another substance or essence, or that the Son of
                  God was mutable or changeable; these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.</p>
               <p>This which is one and alone was constituted against the Arians.</p>

         <noteGrp>
            <note xml:id="n1">The expression, <quote>summoning the Bishops from Ancyra to Nice,</quote> is remarkable, and
               would suggest that which was not the case, for neither the Bishops nor the Emperor were at
               Ancyra at the time. The words discussed in the next note lead us to infer that "from" is
               here used in the sense of "after." Perhaps the Fathers at Ancyra, not regarding their
               conclusions as final, adjourned with the intention of meeting there again; but Constantine
               overruled their decision for the reasons stated in his letter, and required the contemplated Council
               to be held at Nice in Bithynia. This view of the case invests the Ancyrene Synod with peculiar
               interest and importance; and I have, therefore placed in the supplement a list of those who
               were present, extracted from the same MS. The epistle will, perhaps, be not very satisfactory
               to those who maintain the exclusive right of the Pope to call a general council, and not much
               more so to such as believe his concurrence necessary. The sixth general council, it is true,
               affirmed that that of Nice was called by Constantine and Silvester, which is as worthy of credit
               as the declaration of the general council of Florence, that Silvester attended the Nicene
               assembly. Another copy of this letter is found in the add. MS. No. 14526.</note>
