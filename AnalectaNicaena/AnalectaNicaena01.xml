            <head>An Epistle of <persName>Constantine</persName> the King summoning the <persName>Bishops from <placeName>Ancyra</placeName></persName> to <placeName>Nice</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n1"/></head>
            <p>That there is nothing more honourable in my sight than religion, is, I believe,
               manifest to every man. Now because <persName>the Synod of Bishops at <placeName>Ancyra</placeName></persName>, of <placeName>Galatia</placeName>,
               consented formerly that it should be so<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n2"/>, it hath seemed to us now on many accounts,
               that it would be well for it to be assembled at <placeName>Nice</placeName>, <placeName>a city of <placeName>Bithynia</placeName></placeName>, because the
               <persName>Bishops of <placeName>Italy</placeName></persName>, and of <placeName>the rest of the countries of Europe</placeName> are coming, and because of
               the excellent temperature of the air<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n3"/>, and because I shall be at hand as a spectator and
               participator of what is done. Wherefore, I signify to you, my beloved brethren, that ye
               all of you promptly assemble at the city I spoke of, that is at <placeName>Nice</placeName>. Let every one of
               you, therefore, diligently inquire into that which is profitable, in order that, as I before
               said, without any delay we may speedily come to be a present spectator of those things
               which are done by the same. God keep you, my beloved brethren.</p>

            <head>Injunction of the same <persName>Constantine</persName>, against the <persName>Arians</persName>.
               <persName>Constantine the King</persName> to the <persName>Bishops</persName> and nations everywhere.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n4"/></head>
            <p>Inasmuch as <persName>Arius</persName> imitates the evil and the wicked, it is justice that like them he
               should be rebuked and rejected. As therefore, Porphyry, who was an enemy of religion,
               and wrote wicked and lawless writings against the religion of Christians, found the
               reward which was meet for him, that he might be a reproach in all generations after,
               because he fully and insatiably used base fame; so that on this account even his writings
               may be justly destroyed: so also now it hath seemed fit that <persName>Arius</persName> and the holders of
               his opinion, should be all called <persName>Porphyrians</persName>, that he may bear the name of those whose
               evil ways he imitates: and not only this, but also that all the writings of <persName>Arius</persName>, wherever
               found, should be delivered up to be burnt with fire, in order that not only his wicked and
               evil doctrine may perish, but also that the memorial of himself and of his doctrine may
               be blotted out, that by no means there may remain to him any remembrance in the
               <pb n="22"/>world. And this also I ordain, that if any one should be detected secreting any writing
               composed by <persName>Arius</persName>, and should not straightway deliver up and burn it with fire, his
               punishment shall be death; for as soon as he is caught in this, he shall suffer capital
               punishment by beheading, without delay.</p>

            <head>A confession of faith which was made at <placeName>Nicea</placeName>, <placeName>a city of Bithynia</placeName>, in the consulate 
               of <persName>Paulinus</persName> and <persName>Julianus</persName>, in the year 373 of the reckoning of the <persName>Antiochians</persName>, 
               after <persName>Antiochus</persName>; and in the year 636 of the reckoning of the <persName>Macedonians</persName>,
               after <persName>Alexander</persName>, in the month Haziran, on the 19th of it; and on the 13th of

            <p>I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of all things, visible and invisible:
               And in one Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName><ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n6"/> the Son of God, who was begotten of the Father, only
               begotten. Now he is of the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very
               God of very God, who was begotten and not made; of the same substance as the Father;
               by whose hand all things were made which are in heaven and in earth; who for us men
               and for our salvation, came down and became incarnate, and was made man, and suffered,
               and rose the third day, and ascended to heaven, and cometh to judge the living and the
               dead And in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Now those who say that once he was not, and that he was not before he was begotten, 
               or that he was from nothing, or say that he was of another substance or essence,
               or think the Son of God changeable or mutable, these the Catholic and Apostolic Church
               anathematizes.</p>

            <p>I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of all things
               visible and invisible: And in one Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, the only Son of God, who was

               not made; of the same essence as the Father; by whose hands everything was made; who

               Pilate; and suffered, and was buried, and rose the third day according as the Scriptures
               say; and ascended to heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of his Father; and cometh
               again in glory to judge the living and the dead; of whose kingdom there is no end; And
               in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Lifegiver, who proceedeth from the Father; who with
               the Father and the Son, is to be worshipped and glorified; who spake by the prophets:
               <pb n="23"/>And in one Holy, Apostolic and Catholic Church: And I confess one baptism for the

            <p>Ecclesiastical Canons of the great and holy Synod of 318 <persName>Bishops</persName>, which was
               assembled at <placeName>Nicea</placeName>, <placeName>a city of <placeName>Bithynia</placeName></placeName>, and constituted those things which are written
               below.</p>

            <p>There are contained in this book 193 canons which were drawn up in eight different
               Synods, and were translated from Greek into Syriac, carefully and clearly, in <placeName>the city of
               <placeName>Mabug</placeName></placeName>, in the year 812 of <persName>Alexander</persName>.</p>

            <p>Again, a history of these Synods. Now <placeName>the Synod of <placeName>Nicea</placeName></placeName> was assembled in the
               days of <persName>Constantine the Great</persName>; and its chiefs were <persName>Alexander, Archbishop of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName></persName> ;
               and in the place of the papa of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, <persName>Vinto</persName> and <persName>Vicentius</persName>, presbyters of <placeName>Rome</placeName>.</p>

            <p>Again: Now <placeName>the Synod of <placeName>Nicea</placeName></placeName> was assembled because of the affairs of wicked
               <persName>Arius</persName>, who alienated the Son from the nature of the Father; and in that he was begotten
               of the Father, they called him 'made,' and ' a creature,' and (said) that he was not of
               the same nature as the Father.</p>

            <head>Canon 6 of <placeName>Nice</placeName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="n112"/>—On the primacy which belongs to distinguished cities.</head>
            <p>Let the ancient customs be kept in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and in <placeName>Libya</placeName>, and in <placeName>Pentapolis</placeName>, that the
               Bishop of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> should have power over all these; because to him of <placeName>Rome</placeName> also,
               this custom obtains. And so also in <placeName>Antioch</placeName>, and in the other provinces, let the primacy
               be maintained in the churches. Now let this be everywhere known, that if a man should
               be made a bishop without the consent or permission of the Metropolitan, the great Synod
               determines, that he shall not be a bishop. But if two or three for their contentiousness
               should oppose an election common to all of them, when it is orderly, and according to
               the ecclesiastical canon, let the opinion of the majority obtain and stand.</p>

               should be honoured; let him have the degree of his honour. Let there be also maintained

            <head>Addenda: Pseudo-Athanasian and Nicene Creeds.</head>
            <p>It may not be uninteresting to some, if we append here a translation of two Creeds,
               the former professing to be by <persName>Athanasius</persName>, and the latter given as the Nicene Creed. They are
               from a Syriac MS. in the British Museum, No. 12,156, which was written in A.D. 562, and is
               the depository of many curious relics. The volume contains among other things the treatise of
               <persName>Timothy</persName> of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> against <persName>the Council of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName></persName>,' which includes a large number of
               extracts from the Fathers. The so-called Creed of <persName>Athanasius</persName> bears evident marks of a Monophysite 
               origin, and the so-called Nicene Creed is made out of the true Nicene and Constantinopolitan. 
               As I am not aware of their existence elsewhere, I give them a place here, among
               the very few Syriac fragments which I have been able to discover referring to the Council of
               <placeName>Nice</placeName>.</p>
            <div>
               <head>Creed of the blessed <persName>Athanasius</persName>, head of the <persName>bishops</persName> (Archbishop) of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, upon the
                  divine incarnation of God the Word, which consents† to that of the holy Synod which was
                  in <placeName>Nice</placeName>.</head>
               <p>We confess the Son of God, who before the worlds was eternally begotten; who in the
                  end of the worlds was (born) of <persName>Mary</persName> in the flesh for our redemption, as the divine <persName>Apostle</persName>
                  teacheth, saying, <quote>Now when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son who was (born)
                     of a woman,</quote> and he was Son of God and God in the Spirit, but Son of Man in the flesh. The one
                  Son was not two natures, one which is to be worshipped, and another not to be worshipped, but
                  one nature of God the Word, who became incarnate, and is with his flesh, to be worshipped
                  with one worship: nor are there two Sons, one who is the Son of the true God and to be
                  worshipped, but the other from <persName>Mary</persName>, the Son of Man, and not to be worshipped, being Son
                  of God by grace as men also are: but he who was of God, and God as I said, is at once
                  Son of God and God; and he was not another who was also born of <persName>Mary</persName> in the flesh in the
                  last days. As also the angel said to <persName>Mary</persName> mother of God, when she asked, <quote>How shall this
                     be, for I know not a man?</quote>-<quote>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
                  Highest shall overshadow thee, and therefore that Holy One who shall be born of thee
                  shall be called the Son of God.</quote> He therefore that was born of the Virgin <persName>Mary</persName> was
                  by nature Son of God and the true God, and not by grace and communication. In the flesh
                  alone, he that was of <persName>Mary</persName> was Son of Man, but in the Spirit he was both Son of God
                  and God, who bore our sufferings, as it is written, <quote>Christ suffered for us in the flesh;</quote> and
                  again, <quote>For he that spared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all.</quote> For he continued
                  impassible and immutable in the divinity, as it is said by the prophet, <quote>I am God and I change
                  not,</quote> who died our death in the flesh for our sins, that he might remove death by death for us,
                  as <persName>the Apostle</persName> saith, <quote>Death is swallowed up in victory. O Death, where is thy victory? O
                  Grave, where is thy sting?</quote> And again, <quote>Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</quote>
                  Now he continued incomprehensible and immortal in death, in the divinity, according to the
                  impassible power of the Father, as <persName>Peter</persName> saith, <quote>It was not possible that he should be holden
                  of death.</quote> And he ascended to heaven and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, according
                  to his flesh (viz.), that of the Word, which went up from earth, as was said by <persName>David</persName>, <quote>The
                  Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</quote> which is affirmed of our Lord both by
                  him and by <persName>the Apostles</persName>. Now in the Divinity he is infinite, and every place is limited by him
                  <pb n="38"/>With the Father who is eternal he is a son of eternity (=eternal), according to the paternal
                  power which is ineffable, according to the teacher Paul, <quote>Christ the power of God, and Christ
                  the wisdom of God.</quote> And he cometh, being Son of God and God as is confessed, that he may
                  judge the living and the dead, as the <persName>Apostle</persName> saith, <quote>Who shall judge the hidden things of
                  darkness, and reveal the thoughts of the hearts: and he shall render glory and contempt to
                  every man as becometh him.</quote></p>
               <p>Now if a man teach other than these things from the divine Scriptures, saying that the
                  Son of God is one, and the Son of Man who was of <persName>Mary</persName> is another who was made a son by
                  grace as we are; so that there are two Sons, one by nature Son of God, who was of God, and
                  one by grace, the Son of Man who was of <persName>Mary</persName>; or if a man say that the flesh of our Lord is

                  or commuted with it; or that the divinity of the Son was passible; or that the flesh of
                  our Lord is not to be worshipped, inasmuch as it is that of the Son of Man, and is not to be
                  worshipped as being the flesh of our Lord and our God: such a one the Holy and Catholic
                  church anathematizes, since the divine <persName>Apostle</persName> enjoins it, saying, <quote>If a man preach to you other

               <p>We believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and of earth, and of all things
                  visible and invisible:</p>
               <p>And in one Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> the Son of God, who was begotten of the Father, the only
                  begotten. Now he is of the Substance of the Father; God of God; Light of Light; Very
                  God of Very God; who was begotten and not made; of the same substance as the Father; by
                  whom all things were made which are in heaven and which are on earth; who for us men and
                  for our redemption, came down and became incarnate, and became man, and suffered, and rose
                  the third day and he ascended to heaven, and shall come to judge the living and the dead:</p>
               <p>And in the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Now those who say that once he was not, and that he was not before he was begotten, or
                  that he was from nothing, or say that he was of another substance or essence, or that the Son of
                  God was mutable or changeable; these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.</p>

            <note xml:id="n1">The expression, <quote>summoning the <persName>Bishops from <placeName>Ancyra</placeName></persName> to <placeName>Nice</placeName>,</quote> is remarkable, and
               would suggest that which was not the case, for neither the <persName>Bishops</persName> nor the Emperor were at
               <placeName>Ancyra</placeName> at the time. The words discussed in the next note lead us to infer that "from" is
               here used in the sense of "after." Perhaps the Fathers at <placeName>Ancyra</placeName>, not regarding their
               conclusions as final, adjourned with the intention of meeting there again; but <persName>Constantine</persName>
               overruled their decision for the reasons stated in his letter, and required the contemplated Council
               to be held at <placeName>Nice</placeName> in <placeName>Bithynia</placeName>. This view of the case invests the Ancyrene Synod with peculiar
               interest and importance; and I have, therefore placed in the supplement a list of those who
               were present, extracted from the same MS. The epistle will, perhaps, be not very satisfactory
               to those who maintain the exclusive right of the Pope to call a general council, and not much
               more so to such as believe his concurrence necessary. The sixth general council, it is true,
               affirmed that that of <placeName>Nice</placeName> was called by <persName>Constantine</persName> and <persName>Silvester</persName>, which is as worthy of credit
               as the declaration of the general council of <placeName>Florence</placeName>, that <persName>Silvester</persName> attended <persName>the Nicene
               assembly</persName>. Another copy of this letter is found in the add. MS. No. 14526.</note>
            <note xml:id="n2">There is a curious passage in <persName>Athanasius</persName> which speaks of <persName>the Synod of Nice</persName> in this
               way, <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἐν τῇ κατὰ Νίκαιαν μεγάλῃ συνόδῳ συνελθόντες ἐπίσκοποι, οὐκ ἄνευ θέου βουλήσεως,
               συνεχώρησαν ἐν ἑτέρᾳ συνόδῳ τὰ τῆς προτέρας ἐξετάζεσθαι</foreign>. He directly after speaks of this as an
               Oos Talaior, (Apol. c. Arianos 2. Sec. 22.) De Broglie, in his <foreign xml:lang="fr">L'Eglise et L'Empire Romain</foreign>
               (vol. 2, p. 428), asks, "When <persName>St. Athanasius</persName> says, That the bishops assembled in council at
               <placeName>Nice</placeName> declared with the counsel of God that the acts of a council can be re-examined in a later
               synod,' does he refer to a special decree of <persName>the Nicene Fathers</persName> which we have lost, or simply
               to the conduct which they had tacitly authorised by their example in submitting <persName>Arius</persName> to a new
               judgment, when he had been already condemned at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> ?" I think the words in
               <persName>Constantine</persName>'s letter, taken in connection with the words last quoted from <persName>Athanasius</persName>,
               sufficiently explain that this was an ancient custom, and that if we had a full account of <persName>the
               Ancyrene synod</persName>, we should find that its members conformed to that custom by appealing to a
               future council, which, therefore, the emperor summons. The advocates of papal privileges have
               exhausted all their arts to prove that <persName>Constantine</persName> would not call a general council without the
               advice and concurrence of the Roman bishop. It has been supposed that if the circular letter
               convoking the Synod could be found, we should have incontrovertible proof that such was the
               case. But lo! the new discovered oracle is as dumb as all who were consulted before. There
               is not a sentence nor a word which would suggest the idea that the Roman see had any
               authority in the case. <persName>Constantine</persName> himself summons the council, fixes its place, determines
               its time, defines its character. He admits, it is true, the conclusion of <persName>the synod of Aneyra</persName>,
               and it would have been most strange if he had not; everybody saw the desirableness of a grand
               gathering to ascertain the universal mind of the Church in reference to the wretched heresy of
               <persName>Arius</persName>. This is all that is said as to why the Synod was convoked, so far as others are
               concerned. <persName>Constantine</persName> fixes upon <placeName>Nicea</placeName>, because it suited his own convenience, because it
               was a pleasant place, as everybody knew, and because he wished to have at the council the
               bishops of <persName>Italy</persName> and other parts of <persName>Europe</persName>! He does not deign even to allude to Silvester
               except in this general way, as one of the rest. This letter may be rejected, but whoso will
               impugn its genuineness will have to account for its existence, and to explain away its internal
               marks of genuineness. One thing is certain, <persName>Eusebius</persName> says the Emperor wrote to the Bishops,
               and it is also certain that we have here a letter purporting to be a letter to the bishops, and
               which we can prove existed in Greek in the century following that of <persName>the Nicene council</persName>.</note>
            <note xml:id="n3">The Syriac expression accords with the Lat. <foreign xml:lang="ln">coeli temperies</foreign>. The agreeable climate of
               <placeName>Nice</placeName> is alluded to in ancient writers, and this peculiarity is mentioned as one of the principal
               reasons for holding the council there. Libanius calls it <foreign xml:lang="grc">καλὴ Νίκαια</foreign>. The Paschal Chronicle
               alludes to the improvements which <persName>Hadrian</persName> effected there. One old author says it might be
               considered as a model city on every account.</note>
            <note xml:id="n4">The decree against the <persName>Arians</persName> may be found in <persName>Socrates</persName> (Eccles. Hist. 1. 6.) He
               puts at the end the clause with which the previous epistle concludes. The first word in the
               title appears to be incorrectly written for <!-- eb, Syriac. --> which is found in another copy. The word <!-- eb, Syriac. -->
               means to stop the mouth of any one, to silence.</note>
            <note xml:id="n5">There is little difficulty respecting the year of this council, but the day of its opening
               is uncertain. The Syriac date, the 19th of Haziran, or the 13th of the Calends of July, corresponds 
               with June 19th, 325. <persName>The council of Chalcedon</persName> refers it to June 19th, and that was
               most likely about the time.</note>
            <note xml:id="n6">After the word <persName>Christ</persName>, a word equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="grc">μονογένης</foreign> is inserted in the MS. above the
               line, in a more recent hand. As the same word occurs so soon after in the sentence, and is
               not needed here, nor supported by the Greek, I have taken no notice of it in the translation.</note>
            <note xml:id="n7">The creed of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> (A.D. 381) follows that of Nice in the MS., and I have
               inserted it for the sake of comparison with the former. Why it was placed where it is in the
               MS. I know not. It altogether agrees with the Greek copies, and, of course, omits the filioque
               clause, which, as is well known, is of more recent date.</note>

               is a palpable error of the Scribe who read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΤΗΣΙΤΑΛΙΑΣ</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ΤΗΣΙΣΠΑΝΙΑΣ</foreign> in his MS.</note>
            <note xml:id="n9"><persName>Vito</persName> and <persName>Vincentius</persName>, although only presbyters, were reckoned among the Bishops, as

            <note xml:id="n10">Many of the proper names of this list are incorrectly spelled. The names of places
               are generally written in the form of the Greek genitive, which has not been imitated in the
               translation.</note>
            <note xml:id="n11"><foreign>Alpocration</foreign>.-Evidently the same as <persName>Harpocration</persName>. <placeName>Alphocranon</placeName> is more difficult.
               The Coptic has the same word, which is therefore, we may believe, genuine. The Latin lists
               read <placeName>Naucratis</placeName> and <placeName>Alfusia</placeName>. Athanasius mentions <persName>Harpocration</persName> of <placeName>Bubastis</placeName> among the subscribers 
               to <persName>the Council of Sardica</persName>, in 343. This would suggest that Alphocranon is another
               name for Bubastis. The situation of this place, and of <placeName>Naucratis</placeName> is known, but they were a
               considerable distance from each other, and would not be confounded together. It is not
               impossible that <placeName>Heliopolis</placeName> may be meant by the Latin <placeName>Alfusia</placeName>, and the Syriac and Coptic
               <placeName>Alphocranon</placeName>. Of course these are mere conjectures, and in this instance we have nothing else
               to bring. It should be observed, that Socrates makes <persName>Harpocration</persName> Bishop of <placeName>Cynon</placeName>, but this

               I have seen every reason to prefer the Syriac Catalogue to all the rest. The 2 Lat. frequently

               Thesaurus. It was employed to denote the church of a particular city, over which one bishop
               presided. Hence <placeName>Tapoikia Zuúpvns</placeName> was the church of <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>. The word seems also to have

            <note xml:id="n109"><placeName>Divio</placeName>. This comes very near to the Syriac, and is the Latin name for <placeName>Dijon</placeName>: but
               compare the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δουηωνα</foreign> of <persName>Ptolemy</persName>, the modern <placeName>Cahors</placeName>, to which as well as to <placeName>Dijon</placeName>, <placeName>Die and
               Digne</placeName>, the Latin lists refer. <persName>M. de Broglie</persName>, in his recent work before referred to, adopts the
               opinion that <persName>Nicasius</persName> was bishop of <placeName>Digne</placeName> in <placeName>Provence</placeName>.</note>
            <note xml:id="n110">The reason here assigned is the common one, but it is scarcely borne out by the
               facts. The names of several European bishops are actually found in the list. But what is most
               extraordinary is, that if we leave out the two presbyters from Rome, the actual number of
               episcopal signatures is two hundred and eighteen, and not three hundred and eighteen as almost
               universally stated. This singular difference of a hundred reminds us of the Septuagint
               Chronology. There may have been more present at the Council, as <persName>Eusebius</persName> himself gives
               about 250, and he knew something of it. But then, the names of not a few who are said to
               have been at <placeName>Nice</placeName>, are absent from this (and other) catalogues. Perhaps they were not there,
               as we are quite sure some were not, whose names are in the other catalogues, which bear the
               most palpable signs of having been tampered with. Even <persName>Pitra</persName>'s editor exclaims, <quote><foreign xml:lang="ln">‘In cauda
               venenum: Provinciae omnes, quarum catalogus clare incipit, in tenebris desinunt.'</foreign></quote> In other
               words, to serve a purpose names of places and of persons have been invented to make up the
               number. How unlikely that the names of such as were there should be omitted! But we may
               reply again: that such as we do not find here, omitted to subscribe, because they left before the
               business closed, or for some other strong reason. Each of these explanations may apply to
               some, but there is every probability that the Syriac translator omitted no names which he found
               in his copy. Indeed, he distinctly affirms as much by saying, that they were 220 in all; and
               accounts for the absence of the rest. He therefore believed that 318 fathers were present.
               It is worth while to compare the explanation, <quote>"Because the names of the Western bishops
               were not written,"</quote> with what the Emperor says in his circular letter. He fixes upon Nicea
               partly because he wishes to have there the bishops of Italy and the rest of Europe. Of course
               they were there, and yet they alone, or nearly so, are not represented in the lists! If they were
               present, why did they not subscribe more generally? If they were absent, whose authority did
               they confess in the Church?
               As with the 318 of the Nicene council, so is it with <persName>the council of <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName></persName>, with its
               fabulous twice 318 or 636 holy fathers: a list in our ancient MS. gives but 362.
               In the same
               way the 150 of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> are reduced to 135, some of whom, as in the case of Chalcedon,
               were proxies. It is so with the smaller councils at <placeName>Ancyra</placeName>, <placeName>Neocaesarea</placeName>, <placeName>Gangra</placeName>, and <placeName>Antioch</placeName>, in
               the same volume; all give one result. The fact respecting <placeName>Chalcedon</placeName> is very significant, as the
               volume from which our extracts are made was translated from Syriac into Greek exactly half a
               century only after the council was held. It is a charitable supposition that the numbers invited
               have by inadvertence been put down for the numbers present.</note>
