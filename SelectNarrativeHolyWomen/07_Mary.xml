         <p n="1">Again, the martyrdom of the blessed Mary.</p>
         <p n="2">Hadrian and Antoninus, the wicked Emperors, had sent an Imperial decree, that
            everyone who worshipped the Christ should turn to their own religion and law, whilst
            they [who] should eat of the impure sacrifices should live and not die; and that those
            who should be contentious and should resist the decree were to be delivered over to
            judgment.</p>
         <p n="3">Now at that time the blessed Mary, the bride of the Christ, had grown up in the
            Christian confession; for she was the bond-servant of Tertullius, a chief man of the
            city. But she was altogether a free woman of the Christ, and as it is written, "He who
            is called being a slave in the Christ, is the Lord's freeman."</p>
         <p n="4">Now the birthday of the son of Tertullius arrived. And on that day he offered
            sacrifices and libations to the demons. And the noble Mary was slandered in the presence
            of her mistress by one of her companions. And she called her and said to her, "Tell me,
            why didst thou fast, and didst not keep<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> the feast
            with us? Was it a vexation to thee? "</p>
         <p n="5">Mary said, "Because I have lately been fasting. Or didst thou not know that I am a
            Christian, like my fathers?"</p>
         <p n="6">And her mistress constrained her by force to eat. But she cried to the heavenly
            Bridegroom, to Jesus the Christ. And she answered and said, "Ye have power over this my
            body, but not over my soul. Let my speech be heard (though spoken) with boldness. Dost
            thou not understand <milestone unit="folio" n="101a"/>that the festival of thy son was
            celebrated with the music of <pb n="86"/>flutes and with cymbals and with impure rites
            and with drums and with lyres? But the festival of the Christians is celebrated with
            fasting and with praying and with purity and with spiritual songs."</p>
         <p n="7">But as her mistress could not endure her boldness, she said, "I will treat thee so
            that thou shalt die of scourging." Mary answered, saying, "Do what thou wilt, because of
            the help of the Lord that is with me." And when her husband Tertullius came from the
            Forum she told him about the blessed Mary. And immediately without examination he
            commanded them to scourge her with whips. And he commanded them further to shut her up
            alone in a closet, and to give her food by measure. But the blessed one praised God,
            praying continually, that she might remain constant in bearing testimony for the
            Christ.</p>
         <p n="8">And when three days<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> had passed it was told to
            the governor of the city that Tertullius had a certain Christian maid-servant in his
            house, and he was entreated that they might be in their city without any danger till the
            matter should be inquired into. And on the following day the governor sat on the
            judgment-seat, and commanded that they should fetch Tertullius. And all the Praetorium
            was assembled and all the people of the city. And the law of the Emperors was read in
            their presence, in which it was <milestone unit="folio" n="101b"/> thus written: "The
            great and mighty Emperors, the terrible and merciful Diocletian and Antoninus, the
            saviours and architects and supporters of the whole inhabited world, to all those who
            are under the sway<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> of our Empire, and observe the
            right of our majesty and are diligent in the worship of the gods, much greeting. </p>
         <p n="9">"Forasmuch as a report has come to our ears, that suddenly the teachings of
            various men have sprung up, <pb n="87"/>which are contrary to the commandments of the
            gods and that seek to abolish the festivals of sacrifice, and the former laws of our
            ancestors and their great festivals are derided, therefore with the advice of the two
            Emperors, we command simultaneously, because we desire that all men should worship with
               reverence<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/> and fear, and should propitiate the
            gods by sacrifice, and should not be like wandering beasts. And whosoever shall hide a
            Christian man or Christian woman, young men or maidens, old men or children, he shall
            die by the edge of the sword; and his wealth shall be given to the treasury. And
            whosoever shall trace out these people, he shall receive all that they possess, and four
            hundred dinars shall be given to him over and above by the Emperors. And if a man be
            found who has transgressed these things which we command, he shall be held guilty by the
            law."</p>
         <p n="10">And after the decree of the Emperors had been read, the governor answered and
            said to Tertullius, "Make a reply concerning this matter, for this is not a simple
            calamity for thee."</p>
         <p n="11">The advocate, who stood up, said, "Hear us, O wise judge. The girl in whose
            account this innocent man is accused, was given with the dowry of his wife."</p>
         <p n="12">The governor said, "Is his wife of a free family?" <milestone unit="folio"
               n="102a"/> - The advocate replied, "Yes, my lord, she is the daughter of a certain
            Aquilinus." The governor said, "Was this girl born in the house or was she bought with
            money?" Tertullius said, "She was born in the house, but her parents were bought by
            sale." Then the governor asked, "Is the steward alive or dead? "Tertullius said, "Yes,
            my lord, he is dead." Then he asked him, "Are the parents of the girl alive? "Tertullius
            said, "They are not alive." The governor said, "Were they of the religion of the
            Christians, or did they fear the gods ?" The master of the <pb n="88"/>girl answered,
            "They also worshipped the Christ who was crucified."</p>
         <p n="13">The advocate said, "O most wise of judges, they have scourged her with many
            stripes, that she might come to this worship; and if not, thou canst not turn her by
            force from her faith."</p>
         <p n="14">And when the governor had asked all these things he said, "Because the whole of
            the Pretorium bears witness to Tertullius, and they do honour to his family with their
            praises, because he is of the senate, and they proclaim what is straightforward and good
            about him, and that he is a worshipper of the gods, and obedient to the Emperors; and I
            also am convinced by the ancient writings, and the innocency of the man has been truly
            shown to me, he is therefore freed from our judgment until the Emperors can hear him:
            but let the insolent girl stand before the <milestone unit="folio" n="102b"/>
            judgment-seat." And the lictors brought the bride of the Christ and placed her before
            the judge in the court of judgment. Then the wicked and bloodthirsty people shouted
            against her (saying) that she ought to be burnt alive. But the thoughts of the believing
            woman were all with God, and she looked up to the height of heaven, and called with
            boldness on our Lord, saying:</p>
         <p n="15">"O Lord Jesus the Christ, Son of the Living God, true Son of the Father, whose
            birth no man can oppose; neither emperors, nor judges, nor yet principalities, nor
            powers, nor yet lords, nor yet cherubim, nor yet seraphim; because, O Lord, they all
            have been created by Thy hands; and without Thy mandate nothing could have existed; and
            only Thy Father knoweth thee. Therefore He sent Thee from the highest heavens to the
            sinners who were awaiting Thee. Thou, O Lord the Christ, art the glorious High-Priest,
            the Redeemer and Saviour of our souls. O Lord, help Thy handmaiden, for she has no
            helper but Thee; that Thy holy name may be <pb n="89"/>glorified, whilst Thou doest
            these things quickly. Accept the prayer of thy handmaid."</p>
         <p n="16">The governor was amazed and astonished for about an hour: and he commanded that
            they should bring her before the judgment-seat; and he asked her, saying, "What is thy
            name?" And she returned an answer, saying, "Why dost thou seek after my name? I am a
            Christian." The governor said, "Is he who stands [there] thy master? "The noble woman
            said, "He is the master of my body only, but over my soul God rules."</p>
         <p n="17">The governor said, "Why dost thou not worship the <milestone unit="folio"
               n="103a"/>gods as thy master worships (them)? "Mary said, "I am a Christian, and I do
            not worship the dumb idols, but I worship the living and true God, who is eternal."</p>
         <p n="18">The judge said, "From whom didst thou receive (the idea) of being a Christian?
            "Mary said, "I received it from my parents." The judge said, "And were thy parents
            Christians?" Mary said, "They also received it from their parents." The judge said, "I
            suppose that before they received it ye were chiefs in this religion. But even if it be
            so, approach and sacrifice, so that thy master may be quit of the accusation of the
            law." The noble woman said, "How has this entered into the desire of my mind? He also
            ofttimes constrained me to eat of what was sacrificed, and has tortured me with many
            scourgings, but the love of the Christ my master is stronger in grace, more than the
            torments of the wicked (man). And because my parents laid hold of the divine teaching
            which was preached by Paul the Apostle, for he said, 'Who shall separate us from the
            love of the Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or nakedness, or the
               sword?'<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> And because they laid hold of these
            things, they confessed the Christ, and believed that neither death, nor life, nor
            angels, nor principalities, nor <pb n="90"/><milestone unit="folio" n="103b"/>things
            present, nor any other creature can separate us from the love of God, which is in Jesus
            Christ our Lord. As I also say the truth, and I lie not, my conscience, which is Christ,
            bearing me witness, that I depart from this world a Christian." Mary said, "Will thy
            torturers continue to the end, as they have but a short time? Therefore do what thou
            wilt, for I have the Christ, the Saviour of my soul."</p>
         <p n="19">And when the judge had heard this he commanded that they should strip her and
            prepare her for the tortures. And when many people saw her, they wept bitterly and shed
            tears with sobs, and they cried out against the governor, saying that he should show her
            a little patience. But the governor was not willing to be persuaded, but decreed that
            they should torture the blessed one. And again the bystanders cried out against the
            governor, "Thou judgest wickedly; thou art going beyond the law."</p>
         <p n="20">And when the governor heard the voice he was astonished. It appeared to him that
            it was not only men who were crying, but also the buildings were wailing. And he
            commanded the lictors who were standing there not to keep her. And he said to the people
            who were present, "Wherefore are ye making a tumult, and resisting the commands of the
            Emperors? Is it not right for us to hearken unto the commands of the Emperors?"</p>
         <p n="21">They all answered as with one mouth, saying, "The judges of the province, the
            victorious Emperors, command <milestone unit="folio" n="104a"/> with gentleness and
            persuasiveness that men should be led forward to sacrifice. But if they do not obey,
            they are to die by the sword. Now if she does not obey, command concerning her that she
            die by the sword. And we request this, that three days be given to her, so that perhaps
            she may be persuaded, and fulfil the law of the Emperors." The judge said, "Do ye
            persuade her, for, lo! ye have <pb n="91"/>seen that she was not in the least persuaded
            by me." The interpreter said, "What dost thou say, Mary, if three days be given to thee,
            wilt thou sacrifice? "</p>
         <p n="22">Mary answered, "My helper from of old was the Lord." The judge said, "I give thee
            a respite of three days, and I swear by all the gods that if thou art so stubborn again
            thou shalt die by a variety of tortures." The noble woman said, "Only one thing do I ask
            of thee, that my master shall be held blameless, and shall be liberated, as innocent,
            from the judgment." The governor said, "He shall be liberated blameless; and thou, if
            thou wilt be persuaded, shalt receive gifts, and shalt find freedom, which is a great
            thing among men." Mary said, "As the Christ liveth, He who hath given me all freedom,
            and in whom I trust."</p>
         <p n="23">Then he commanded that she should be kept carefully without dishonour. And the
            blessed one descended from [before] the tribunal and signed herself with purity. And she
            ran actively and lifted up her eyes to heaven and prayed, saying, "I will lift up mine
            eyes unto the mountains, from whence my helper shall come. My help cometh from before
            the Lord, who made heaven and earth."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> And suddenly
            she saw wonderful <milestone unit="folio" n="104b"/>things; the heavens which were
            opened and troops of the angels and the archangels standing, and the prophets, and the
            apostles, and the martyrs, and the confessors, and amongst them she saw Thekla her
            sister. And then she saw the cherubim and the seraphim and the Son of God on the right
            hand of His Father. And thus the noble woman rejoiced, as one who has just entered
            through the gate of Paradise. But as for her persecutors their limbs became weak, and
            they fell, because of the help of the Lord, which accompanied His handmaiden. But many
            others were pursuing her. And when they surrounded her on every side she cried with a
            loud voice, saying, "Lord Jesus the Christ, Thou art He who came down to <pb n="92"/>the
            fiery furnace in Babylon and rescued the three young men from the fire. And Thou art He
            who didst shut the mouth of the lions and rescued Daniel Thy servant, and didst lift him
            out of the lions' den unharmed. Also Thou didst deliver Jonah from the sea and from the
            belly of the fish, and Thou didst bring him up in three days. Thou, Lord Jesus, didst
            give light to the blind, and didst give hearing to the deaf. Thou wast the Healer of all
            sufferers, and the expectation of all the righteous. Thou art He, Lord, who didst hear
            the voice of the blood of Abel, and didst avenge him of Cain his brother. Thou art He,
            Lord, who wast present with Joseph, and didst deliver him from being slain by his
            brothers. Thou art He, Lord, who didst come, and art about to come to judge the quick
            and the dead. Redeemer of Thy handmaid! Jesus the Christ! hearken to my voice, and
            receive my soul; for dogs have compassed me about. Deliver not Thine handmaid into the
            hands of those who hate Thee. Thou, Lord, art the Mediator between God and man. Hear,
            Lord, the voice of Thy handmaiden, and redeem me according to the plenteousness of Thy
            mercy. ,,</p>
         <p n="24">And when she had finished her prayer, the rock before her was cleft, and it
            opened its bosom for [her] deliverance <milestone unit="folio" n="105a"/> like a
            foster-mother for her son; and it treasured up the bride of the Christ in its bosom. And
            the great crowd who were there went round about like blind people seeking for her. And
            when they came to that rock they found on the top of it something like three
            finger-breadths of the corner of her veil, and the fringes which were visible. And they
            returned and informed the governor of what had happened.</p>
         <p n="25">And the governor, in a great rage, commanded a certain man whose name was
            Placimus, the ruler of the city, to go to that place with a great many people, and to
            quarry the rock, and to dig deep in the earth, until they <pb n="93"/>should find the
            blessed one. And when Placimus had received this commandment, he ordered the herald to
            cry aloud in the city and to sly, "All ye citizens! assemble yourselves, and gather at
            tlie appointed time, and come; and let us take vengeance for our goddess." And when they
            were all assembled in the temple of the idols, he commanded them to take iron tools that
            they might dig the place with them. And when they were all assembled, and were ready to
            go and work, suddenly there was lightning from the east, and fearful thunder, and a
            great earthquake, and there appeared two terrible horsemen descending as it were from
            heaven to earth; and their lances were like burning lamps, and at the same moment many
            fell down through fright and died. And those who remained were chased by them as far as
            the door of the idol-temple. But when Placimus arrived at the door he also suddenly fell
            and died. And fire came down from heaven and burnt up the <milestone unit="folio"
               n="105b"/> house and the idols, and many of the wicked people were burnt. And those
            who died were, with those who were burnt, two thousand seven hundred in number. And
            those who were left fled to the city, and they cried, saying, "Great is Mary's God and
            great is the God of the Christians, and He is God in truth."</p>
         <p n="26">And they ran in a crowd and went into the church, seeking mercy from God, for the
            wicked things which they had done. And three thousand souls from amongst them believed
            on that day. And in the days of the martyrdom of the blessed Mary the persecution of the
            Christians ceased.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/></p>
         <p n="27">Here endeth the martyrdom of the blessed and noble Mary, and she conquered in the
            conflict with the wicked judge.</p>
