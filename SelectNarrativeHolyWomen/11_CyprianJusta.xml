         <p n="1">Again, the martyrdom of Cyprian the wizard, and of Justa the virgin.</p>
         <p n="2">At the appearance of our Redeemer, Jesus the Christ from heaven upon the earth,
            and on the fulfilment of the words of the prophets, everything beneath the heaven was
            illumined, that they might be baptized into one God the Father Almighty, and into the
            Lord Jesus the Christ, and into the Holy Spirit in the belief of the truth.</p>
         <p n="3">Now there was a certain virgin whose name was Justa, and the name of her father
            was Aedesius; and of her mother Cledonia, in the town of Antioch which is near Daphne.
            And this blessed one listened to a certain deacon whose name was Praylius, from a window
            which was near her house. And when she heard the great deeds of God, and how our
            Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ put on a body, and the heralding of the prophets, and His
            birth from Mary, and the worship of the Magi; and about the appearance of the star and
            the praise of the angels, and the signs of the miracles that were done in His name and
               <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="74a"
            />by His power; and of the redemption of the cross; and of His resurrection from the
            dead; and of His glory in the presence of the disciples; and of the living words of His
            gospel to His apostles; and of His ascension to Heaven; and of His being seated on the
            right hand; and of His imperishable kingdom; and of the bliss that passeth not away, and
            of the deathless life.</p>
         <p n="4">[And when the blessed one had heard these things, she <pb n="186"/>marvelled
            greatly in the belief of the truth, and the eye of the maiden sparkled with the love of
            the Holy Spirit. She longed greatly and sought that she might again see the deacon
            Praylius; but she could not (do it).]<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/> She answered
            and said to her mother, "Hearken to thy daughter, my mother, and turn from error, and
            thou shalt escape from everlasting torment; as thou hast heard that the scriptures of
            our Lord Jesus Christ say, He who hath made the heaven and the earth and all that is
            therein. For sculptures are nothing. They are of stone, and of wood, and of gold, the
            work of men's hands, images, deaf, and blind, and lifeless." Then her mother said to
            her, "Nay, my daughter, let not thy father hear this in thy thoughts." But the blessed
            one answered and said to her mother, "Know ye, O my father and my mother, that
            henceforth I am a Christian, and I worship the Christ my Redeemer, because by means of
            this deacon I have learnt the way of life. And henceforth there is no God except the
            Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And He gives life to the <milestone
               ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="74b"/> men who
            believe in Him, and He has redeemed them from the destruction of the wicked, and has
            made them to inherit deathless life." When she had said these things, she signed herself
            in the Threefold name, and began to pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. But her
            mother told her father everything that the blessed one had said. Then immediately
            numberless hosts of angels appeared to them, holding lamps of fire in the chamber.<ptr
               type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> And in the midst of them they saw the Christ,
            saying, "Come to Me, I will make you enter the kingdom of heaven. With all the holy ones
            who have done well in My presence."</p>
         <p n="5">And when Aedesius, the father of the girl, saw that sight, he was seized with
            great wonder. And he arose in the morning, and led his wife, and his daughter, the
            blessed <pb n="187"/>one, and they went to the church with that deacon, beseeching him
            to present them to the bishop. And when he presented them, the Bishop received them. And
            they fell at his feet and besought him that he would give them the seal of the Christ.
            But he was unwilling to give it to them, until the deacon related to him about the
            vision of the Christ which he had seen, and about the faith and the love to the Christ
            of the maiden.</p>
         <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="75a"/>
         <p n="6">But Aedesius shaved his hair because he was a priest of the gods; and he fell at
            the feet of the Bishop, and ' a he gave to the three the seal of the Christ. And the
            holy Aedesius was deemed worthy of the priesthood, and he lived a short time, and went
            to rest in the true faith. And the holy virgin went at all seasons to the church of the
            Christ. But a certain man, a lawyer of a great family, who was evil in his deeds, and
            who was enchained in the worship of error, of dead images, saw the blessed one going at
            all seasons to the house of God. And when he saw her, he was captivated by the love of
            the maiden, and he sent many people after her, that he might take her to wife. But she
            said to them all with a loud voice, "I am betrothed to the Christ." And the wicked man,
            by the mad impulse of Satan, assembled a great crowd, and watched her as she went to the
            house of God. And he wished to lead her away by force. And when they came to lead her
            forcibly away, those who were with the maiden cried with a loud voice. And when those
            who were in their house heard these things, they came out grasping swords. And those who
            had come to seize the handmaiden of God by force, fled.</p>
         <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="75b"/>
         <p n="7">But the holy one sealed herself with the sign of the Christ, and she seized the
            insolent man and flung him on f,76b the ground. And she struck him on the face. And she
            tore his clothes and left him stupified, as her sister Thecla <pb n="188"/>had done to
            the insolent Alexander. And she went forthwith to the house of God.</p>
         <p n="8">But he went in a great rage to Cyprian the wizard, and promised him two talents of
            gold, if mayhap he might entrap the holy maiden with his sorcery, whilst the madman did
            not know that the power of the Christ is unconquerable.</p>
         <p n="9">But when Cyprian the wizard had heard these things, he was grieved for the young
            man, and called up a certain cruel demon by his sorcery. And it answered and said to
            him, "Why hast thou called me?" And Cyprian said to it, "That I may please a certain
            maiden of the Galileans, if thou canst bring her to me."</p>
         <p n="10">But the demon, ashamed, promised that it would bring her to him, whilst he was
            unable to conquer the truth. Cyprian answered and said to it, "Tell me, what are thy
            works, in which thou confidest, and I will send thee away." The accursed demon answered
            and said to him, "I am a rebel against God, and I obey Satan. And I made Eve to sin, and
            I have' driven Adam out of Paradise. <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="76a"/>And I have robbed him of
            bliss and of delight. And I have taught Cain to kill his brother. And I have polluted
            the earth with blood. And I have increased adultery and sorcery. And I have made all
            lasciviousness and drunkenness. And I have incited silly laughter. And I have taught men
            to worship images. And I have counselled that the Christ should be crucified. And I have
            shaken the whole city. And I have overturned walls. And I have divided houses."</p>
         <p n="11">And when the demon had said these things that had been done by it, it said to the
            wizard, "I have done all these things, and am I unable to conquer this?" Then Cyprian
            said to him, "Take this root and sprinkle it round about the house of the maiden. And I
            will take her mind <pb n="189"/>away from her, and immediately she will obey thee." And
            when he had said these things to the demon, he went straight to the house of that
            maiden. But the blessed one stood up to pray the None in the night to God the lover of
            the penitent. And when she became aware of the arrival of the demon, she prayed all the
            more to the Living God, because her mind was satiated with the love and the power of the
            Cross, and she signed herself with the sign of the Christ. And she called with a loud
            voice, saying, "O Lord, Almighty God! Father of our Lord Jesus the <milestone

               type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> Thou who didst kill the man-slaying serpent, and
            didst deliver those who were bound by Satan, O Lord God! who didst create man in Thine
            (own) image, and didst leave him in the paradise of delights to enjoy himself in Thy
            commandments, â€” and he was thrown down by the deception of the serpent. And when he
            sinned thus Thou didst not forsake him, but by the power of Thy cross Thou didst cure
            his wounds, and didst make him whole, by means of the Christ, the Redeemer of the
            worlds, He by whom the created things were made, and the heavens were set in order, and
            the earth was stretched out; and the waters of the great deep were separated, that all
            natural things should confess to Thee, O God! O Lord Jesus the Christ, redeem Thy
            handmaiden; and let not the temptation of the enemy come near me. To Thee, O Lord! I
            have made a vow that I would be a virgin to Thine only Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
            Redeem Thy handmaiden, because I have loved Thee and will love Thee, with<ptr

            strength. Thou, O Lord! hast made the light of Thy love to shine on my soul. I beseech
            Thee, O Lord! leave me not to the hands of the Wicked one, that I may not transgress the
            promise that I have made to Thee. <pb n="190"/>Chase away the thought of the rebel from
            my mind; and keep me in Thy truth." And when she had said these things, she signed
            herself with the sign of the Christ, and <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="77a"/>she puffed at the demon; and
            he went away ashamed; and he stood before Cyprian; and Cyprian said to him, "Where is
            the woman for whose sake thou hast been sent?" The demon answered and said to him, "Do
            not ask me, for I cannot tell thee. For I saw a certain sign and I have run away." But
            Cyprian laughed at him; and he again called by his sorcery a stronger demon than the
            first one. And the cursed one boasted, and said to Cyprian, "I knew thy commandment and
            also the cowardice of him who was before me. Send me O my father! and I will do thy
            will."</p>
         <p n="12">And Cyprian said to him, "Take this root, and throw it outside the house of the
            maiden, and I will come and persuade her." And when the demon had come to the place
            which Cyprian had told him of, the handmaiden of God stood up to pray the Sext of the
            night, saying thus, "At midnight I have arisen, and I will praise Thee for Thy righteous
            judgments. God of all! Lord of the heights and of the depths, who hast confounded Satan
            by Thy power, and hast put him down under the feet of Thy disciples. May the
            confirmation of Thy mercy remain with me, O God! who didst receive the sacrifice of
            Abraham; and didst hear the prayer of Daniel; and didst overthrow Bel, and didst slay
            the dragon; and didst shew the knowledge of Thy divinity to the Babylonians, God, who by
            means of Thine Only Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, didst dispose everything, and didst
            bring out everything that was concealed in darkness to the light; and didst bring to
            life even those who were dead. And now, O Lord! in the abundance of Thy grace neglect me
            not, O Merciful One! but keep my soul and my body near to <pb n="191"/>Thy holiness.
            Keep also the lamp of my virginity, that it may not go out; that I may enter with the
            Bridegroom, the Christ, to the marriage feast; and may commit to Him my virginity in
            purity and holiness."</p>
         <milestone ed="S.P." unit="folio" n="173b"/>
         <p n="13">And the demon went away from her ashamed, and appeared to Cyprian. And Cyprian
            answered and said to it, "Where is the woman on whose account thou hast been sent?" It
            answered and said to him, "I cannot tell thee. For I saw a certain sign and I was
            afraid, and ran away."</p>
         <p n="14">Then Cyprian called one whom he thought to be stronger than they, who was the
            father of the demons, and said to him, "Who is this slight thing by whom thy power has
            been conquered ?" The demon answered and said to him, "I will bring her to thee, be
            ready at once." Cyprian answered and said to it, "What is the sign of thy victory?" The
            demon answered and said to him, "I will enfeeble her with much fever for six days, and
            at midnight I will make her ready for thee."</p>

         <p n="15">And the demon went and appeared to the maiden in the form of a maiden, her
            companion. And it went in and a sat down on the bed as if it had been a woman, and the
            evil one began to talk to the handmaiden of God in the manner of penitence. "I beseech
            thee, O handmaiden of God, receive me, that I may be with thee. The Christ, thy Lord,
            hath sent me to thee. For I also am a virgin like thee, and shew me what is the struggle
            for virginity, or what recompense there is to those who keep it in purity. For I have
            seen thee that thou art greatly afflicted in the conflict."</p>
         <p n="16">But the holy maiden, the servant of God, answered and said to her, "The
               tongue<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> of man cannot describe the reward of the
            virginity which is for the sake of the Christ; <pb n="192"/>for it<ptr type="noteAnchor"
               target="#n8"/> is very great. God has promised to those who love Him and preserve
            their virginity, what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it arisen in the heart
            of man. Who is able to comprehend the blessings which God has promised to those who love
            Him and preserve their virginity in purity? The struggle for virginity in this world is
            for a little while; but the blessings which are preserved for it in that world are
            neither transitory nor corruptible."</p>
         <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="78b"/>
         <p n="17">But the wicked demon began to speak with guile to the handmaid of God, saying to
            her, "Behold, I have heard that Eve was a virgin in Paradise, and was not blest. And
            when Adam had known her, and she had given birth to children, she received the knowledge
            of good and of evil. And by her means the world was peopled; and there was the
            succession of races and of tribes."</p>
         <p n="18">But when the holy virgin heard these things, she rose up to pray because of the
            words of the crafty one. And the cursed fiend kept close to her, lest perchance there
            might be an opportunity for him to capture her. But the blessed handmaid knew the
            craftiness of Satan, and was much troubled because she had perceived that he was a
            deceiver; and she hastened to prayer in the presence of God. And she sealed herself with
            the sign of the cross. And she puffed at that demon in the power of Jesus the Christ.
            And he fled ashamed from beside the handmaiden of God, and went sadly to him who had
            sent him. But the holy one was strengthened by the power of the Christ, and rested from
            the dispute with the crafty one, and gave thanks to God who had helped her in the
            struggle. And straightway the fever left her. And she <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="79a"/>began to say, "Praise be to

            />dost illuminate (with) Thy glorious beams those who are blind in the darkness of evil,

            and deceives is allied to us, and becomes our comrade in that fearful place. For that
            torment is bitter. For they boil copper and place it on the limbs of both men and women.
               <pb n="194"/>And thus by hard boiling they are<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/>
            tortured before the tribunal of Him who was crucified. And the angels also afflict them
            with severity."</p>
         <p n="26">Cyprian said, "Therefore I also wish that I could be a friend to Him who was
            crucified; that I also may not fall into His hard condemnation."</p>
         <p n="27">The demon said, "And hast thou not sworn to me by my great power that thou wilt
            not deal falsely? "</p>
         <p n="28">Cyprian said, "By what have I sworn to thee and have dealt falsely?"</p>
         <p n="29">Saith the demon, "By my great power."</p>
         <p n="30">Cyprian said, "I reject thee and I scorn thy great power. For this night I have
            surely learned that I can take refuge in the prayer and the intercession of a virgin.
            And I supplicate by the power of the cross. And by it all thy lying power is humbled.
            For I also sign myself with the cross, and deny thee and all thy power."</p>
         <p n="31">And when he had spoken thus, he sealed himself with the sign of our Redeemer, and
            said, "Glory be to Thee, O Christ! <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="80a"/> O invincible Power! "</p>
         <p n="32">And immediately Satan fled.</p>
         <p n="33">And Cyprian said, "Henceforth I believe in the Christ, and He redeems from all
            the power of the Evil one."</p>
         <p n="34">But the demon went away ashamed. And Cyprian took the tablets of his sorcery and
            made the four men of his household carry them; and thus he went to the house of God; and
            he fell at the feet of the presbyter Euthymius,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/>
            and said to him:</p>
         <p n="35">"O blessed servant of God! I implore thee that I may become a soldier of God and
            of our Lord Jesus the Christ; and that I may be inscribed in the book of the believers â€”
            those who serve Him." But the presbyter Euthymius imagined that perhaps he was seeking
            to deceive <pb n="195"/>those who were in the church. So the holy one said to Cyprian,
            "Let it suffice thee that thou hast deceived so many people who are without. Take heed
            to thyself, and do not come into the church of God with guile. For the power of the
            Christ is invincible."</p>
         <p n="36">Cyprian answered and said, "Of a truth, my lord, I, too, know that it is
            invincible. For this night I sent demons against the holy virgin Justa. And she
            conquered them by her prayer and by her love to the Christ. But take the books of my
            sorcery, with which I have done all <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="80b"/>the evil, and burn them in
            the fire. And take pity on me, and let me belong to the flock of the Christ."</p>
         <p n="37">And when the holy Euthymius had heard these things from that wizard, he took his
            tablets and burnt them in the fire. And he blessed him and began to say to him, "Be
            constant in the house of God at the time of prayer."</p>
         <p n="38">And Cyprian went to his house rejoicing; and he broke all the images that
            belonged to him. And all night he beat his hands on his face and on his breast, saying,
            "I have dared to withstand Thy power, Lord Jesus the Christ! in all the wicked things
            that I did. And how may I bless Thee with the mouth wherewith I cursed the men who
            called upon Thy name." And he threw dust upon his head, and flung himself on his face
            upon the earth, and wept for seven days. And after the seven days, he got up early as
            great Saturday began, and he went to the house of God. And as he was going on the road,
            he said in his prayer:</p>
         <p n="39">"O Christ! O Helper of those who call upon Thee in truth! If I am worthy to
            become Thy servant, shew me some place where I may enter Thy holy house, and may

         <p n="40">And when he had entered the house of God he heard <pb n="196"/>the chorister<ptr

            And then, "O Lord! be not far from me."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> And again
            he heard Isaiah who said, "Behold my servant shall deal prudently, and shall be exalted,
            so that many shall be astonished at him,"<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> and
            again David saith, "Mine eyes have prevented the watches that I might meditate on Thy

         <p n="41">And again Isaiah has said, "Fear not, O my servant Jacob, and Israel, whom I have
               chosen."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> And again the Apostle, who says, "The
            Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law."<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"
            /> And again David hath said, "Who shall relate the wonderful works of the Lord?"<ptr
               type="noteAnchor" target="#n17"/> And again the Gospel, which hath said, "That
            whosoever believeth in me should not perish, but should have eternal life."<ptr
               type="noteAnchor" target="#n18"/> And again they proclaimed, "That whosoever did not
            receive the sign should go out." And Cyprian sat at the threshold of the door, and one
            of the deacons said to him, "Rise and get thee out." But Cyprian answered and said unto
            him, "I am a bond-servant of the Christ; and thou sayest to me, 'Get thee out!'"</p>
         <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="81b"/>
         <p n="42">And that deacon said to him, "Thou art not yet initiated, Cyprian." And Cyprian
            said to him, "As the Christ liveth, He who confounded the demons, and hath had mercy on
            me and on the maiden, I will not go out until I am initiated." And Asterius the deacon
            went and informed the Bishop. And the Bishop called Cyprian. And he repeated to him the
            words of the holy scriptures. And he prayed, and thus he baptized him in the name of our
            Lord Jesus the Christ.</p>
         <p n="43">And after eight days he became a preacher of the hidden mysteries.</p>
         <p n="44">And when it was Pentecost, he was full of the grace of God, and healed demons and
            pains in the name of <pb n="197"/>Jesus the Christ. And until one year was completed, he
            became the assessor of the Bishop. And for sixteen years he held the sacred throne. And
            after these things the holy Euthymius summoned the Bishops who were round about, and
            said to them things that were worthy of the Church of God, and he, while still living,
            gave him the throne of the bishopric. And after a few days, the holy Euthymius went to
            rest in the Lord,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n19"/> and confided to him the flock of
            the Christ. For the holy Cyprian had put many things in order, and had made the holy
            Justa <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="82a"
            />a deaconess, and he enlightened many, and delivered them from all the heresies of
            destruction; and increased the Church of the Christ; fulfilling the words of the
            prophets, fulfilling also the commandments of the Christ, whilst he laboured concerning
            the belief of the truth. He looked on the people who were scattered, and on the wolf
            whilst he was robbing.</p>
         <p n="45">And the holy Cyprian taught many (people) of the city by letters. But the Lord of
            evil, crafty Satan, incited the sons of error to calumniate the holy one before
            Eutolmius, Count of the East, and they said to him, "Cyprian is the teacher of the
            Christians; and he makes void the glory of the gods by his many sorceries, with a
            certain virgin, and disturbs all the world by his letters, and makes women virgins."</p>
         <p n="46">And the Count was filled with rage, and he commanded the judges to bind Cyprian
            and the maiden carefully, and to bring them to the city of Damascus and produce them
            before him. And when they had come before the Count he said to them, "Art thou the
            teacher of the Christians? who of old hast turned away many from the praise of the gods,
            and hast deceived many by Him who was crucified? exalting Him more than the gods? "</p>
         <pb n="198"/>
         <p n="47">But the holy Cyprian said, "Why hast thou given thyself to the likeness of
            wickedness? and to the madness of the evil one? For I, as thou hast said, was captive to
            the enemy of justice, whilst I was the teacher of the pagans; and I slew many by every
            kind of sin. And when the Christ redeemed me, He helped me also by means of this maiden.
            A certain lawyer from the house of Claudius fell in love with her. And when he could not
            find (a way) to do evil to the handmaiden of God, desiring to capture her for his wife,
            he came to me and begged me to do the business of love for him. And I, confiding in the
            books of my sorcery, sent the demons against her. And she made them flee by the sign of
            the Christ. And thus (it was) until the third one. I even sent their chief, and that
            holy maiden overthrew them by the same sign of <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="83a"/>the Christ. And when I saw
            what had happened, I adjured that demon that he should tell me for what reason he could
            do nothing with the power of the maiden. And when the demon was burnt by the angel he
            told me all the truth. And he said to me again, I am the discoverer of all bad things.
            And I recollected myself and gave the tablets of my sorcery to the Bishop, my
            predecessor, whilst all the chief men of the city were present. And he burnt them in the
            fire. I would also persuade thee now to withdraw thyself from the madness of images, and
            come to the house of God, and thou shalt know the power of the Christ, which is
            invincible."</p>
         <p n="48">Then the Count was enraged against the blessed one. And he commanded that he
            should be hung up and combed. Also concerning the holy virgin, he commanded that she
            should be beaten<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n20"/> with rough thongs on her face;
            the two being hung opposite to each other. And the maiden began to say, "Glory be to
            Thee, O true Christ! <pb n="199"/>that Thou hast brought me who am unworthy near, to
            fulfil Thy will. And I am beaten<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n21"/> because of Thy
            name, which exalts its worshippers." And when the lictors were weary of beating the
            blessed one, she praised God all the more. <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="83b"/></p>
         <p n="49">But the Count commanded them to cease from her. And when Cyprian was being combed
            he did not feel the combs.</p>
         <p n="50">The Count answered and said to him, "Sacrifice and escape from the tortures, and
            thou shalt not die miserably."</p>
         <p n="51">The holy Cyprian replied and said to him, "Why dost thou exalt thyself against
            God and withdrawest from Him? and dost not wish to draw near to the gospel of the
            Christ? For thou wilt not keep me back from the path of life. For I am running that I
            may attain to the heavenly-minded who inherit the kingdom, and may be made worthy, by
            means of those tortures which thou art bringing to me, of bliss that can never pass
            away."</p>
         <p n="52">The Count said, "And wilt thou inherit the kingdom of heaven because of these
            tortures? I will bring greater ones than these to thee."</p>
         <p n="53">And he commanded that they should conduct him to the prison-house, and the holy
            Justa with him. And he commanded that they should be guarded with diligence. And when
            they entered the prison-house, it shone by the grace of our Lord Jesus the Christ who
            was with them.</p>
         <p n="54">And after a few days the Count commanded that they should bring them before his
            judgment seat. And the <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14"
               unit="folio" n="84a"/>Count answered and said to the blessed ones, "Do not be
            deceived by the faith and the sorcery of a mortal man, and lose your lives."</p>
         <p n="55">But Cyprian answered and said to him, "This death has won eternal life for those
            who love Him."</p>
         <pb n="200"/>
         <p n="56">The senseless Count answered and said, "Heat the frying-pan and throw into it
            pitch, and wax, and bitumen, and fling the blessed ones into it<ptr type="noteAnchor"
               target="#n22"/> when it boils." And when they had thrown him in, he was not at all
            hurt.</p>
         <p n="57">Then the Count commanded, and they brought the blessed Justa to the frying-pan.
            And when she drew near, the Evil one cast fear into her mind, and she began to be
            afraid. But the blessed Cyprian cried and said to her, "Come, O handmaiden of God! for
            thou hast shown me the path of life; and thou hast opened to me the door of heaven; and
            thou hast shown me the glory of the Christ. Thou hast been strengthened against the
            demons. Even their chief thou hast reckoned as nothing by the power of the cross. And
            how shouldst thou fear the fire."</p>
         <p n="58">And the blessed one signed all her body, and ascended into the fiery frying-pan.
            And both of them rejoiced and exulted in the frying-pan as amongst refreshing dew.</p>
         <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="84b"/>
         <p n="59">And Cyprian answered and said, "Glory be to God in the highest, and peace on the
            earth; and goodwill to upright and faithful men." And he said again, "Because Satan is
            fallen from heaven, and is trampled beneath the feet of all those who believe in the
            King, the Christ, our Redeemer. For He hath bound the Evil one in darkness and all who
            obey him. I praise Thee, O God! for all in which Thou hast deemed us worthy to suffer
            contempt for Thy sake. I implore of Thee, O merciful Lord, to receive our sacrifice for
            a sweet savour of Thy greatness."</p>
         <p n="60">And the Count heard, and laughed, and said, "I curse you and all the skill of
            your sorcery."</p>
         <p n="61">And Athenus his colleague and profane friend said to the Count, "Let thy Highness
            command me, my lord, and I will approach the boiling pan in the name of the gods; and I
            will overcome the great power of the Christ." <pb n="201"/>And the Count said to him,
            "Approach." And when he approached the frying-pan, he lifted up his voice and said,
            "Great is the god Zeus! and the father of the gods Asclepius, who giveth health unto
            men." And when he <milestone ed="Add.12,142" edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14"
               unit="folio" n="85a"/>came near to the boiling of the flame he fell, and all his
            limbs were split like wax before the fire. But the grace of God preserved the holy
            Cyprian and the maiden without a spot; because they praised God.</p>
         <p n="62">And the Count was troubled and said, "What shall I do? He who was my priest and
            friend has died miserably. What I shall do to these wicked people I do not know."
            Terentinus answered and said to him, "Have nothing to do with these people whom thou
            dost call wicked. And do not withstand the truth. For the power of the Christians is
            invincible. But send them to the Emperor, shewing him the matter of their crime. "</p>
         <p n="63">And the Count wrote the report about it thus:</p>
         <p n="64">"To the great Emperor Caesar, who ruleth by land and by sea, Diocletian,
            greeting. Against the commandment of thy Majesty have these men arisen. And I have
            apprehended them: Cyprian, who is the teacher of the Christians, and the virgin, who is
            named Justa. And from the reports, my lord, thou wilt learn into how many tortures and
            afflictions I have thrown them; and they <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="85b"/>would not be persuaded by me
            to obey thy laws, my lord, and I have sent them to thine august Majesty." And when the
            Emperor had read these reports about the blessed ones, he was greatly astonished at
            their endurance, and his friends implored him and said to him, "Do not withstand the
            great power of God."</p>
         <p n="65">And when the Emperor had heard [it] he said: "To Cyprian who is the teacher of
            the Christians with the virgin Justa, who have chosen the vain heresy of those who are
            called Christians; and have forsaken life, and <pb n="202"/>have chosen death. Therefore
            I command concerning them, that their heads be taken off with the sword.</p>
         <p n="66">And while the blessed ones were being led off to death, to a certain place in
            which they were to reach their consummation, they asked the lictors that a little time
            might be given them, in which they might pray.</p>
         <p n="67">And the holy Mar Cyprian began to pray, saying, "Remember, O Lord! Thy Church, in

            Thy name."</p>

         <p n="68">And he made the sign of the Christ over his whole body, and he placed the virgin
            Justa on his right hand: and he persuaded these lictors that she should be beheaded
            before him. And so the lictors did.</p>
         <p n="69">And the holy Cyprian said, "Glory be to Thee, O Christ, the Strengthener of Thy
            worshippers!"</p>
         <p n="70">And a certain great man was there whose name was Theoctistus, a faithful man; and
            he approached and greeted the holy martyr as he was being slain with the sword. And
            Balbus, the colleague of the Emperor, commanded concerning him, that his head should be
            taken off with the sword.</p>
         <p n="71">And when they had been crowned, and the blessed Theoctistus with them, the bodies
            of the blessed ones were thrown to the wild beasts. And they did not approach them for
            many days.</p>
         <p n="72">But a sailor, a certain faithful man, when he heard about the end of the holy
            ones, because he was a kinsman of Theoctistus, took faithful men of his own with him.
            And he made them sit for six days and six nights, until they had snatched away the
            corpses of the blessed martyrs <milestone ed="Add.12,142"
               edRef="https://bl.syriac.uk/ms/14" unit="folio" n="86b"/>from the custodians, because
            the bones of the blessed ones were much more precious to them than gold, or silver, or
            costly pearls. And they carried them to the city of <pb n="203"/>Rome with their
            memoirs. And they gave them to a certain woman whose name was Rufina, of the
            distinguished family of the Claudians. And this faithful woman Rufina carried the bones
            of the holy martyrs and laid them in an honourable place wrapped in pure linen, and with
            fragrant spices. And every one who approached the blessed ones received health and help
            from them.</p>
         <p n="73">And these things were done in the consulate of Diocletian, in the city of
