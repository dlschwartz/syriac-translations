            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to <persName>John</persName> and
                  <persName>John</persName> the presbyters and the rest.</head>

               71st letter.</head>
            <p> I owe thanks to God that after the winter-season I have again through your letter
               heard your sweet and cheerful voice. For to me to hold communication with you seems
               more cheerful and joyful than any spring. To delight and adorn ourselves with flowers
               from the meadows that quickly bloom and wither is not like weaving together blossoms
               of spiritual words. The first blossom, one very well adapted for giving joy, was
               contained in your letter in the fact that the celebration of the saintly <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2107">Theodore</persName> the presbyter <note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"> The first Saturday in
                  Lent (Sachau Verz. d. syr. Hdschr. zu Berlin, p. 486).</note> provided a crowded
               festival and feast to those who assembled, so that the believers are confirmed in
               future hope even by what is seen now. For the departure hence of holy men and the
               remembrance of them on the occasion of this is a means of instruction and of
               meditation on the blessed life: the life which <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName> promised when He revealed
               to us by actual experience the mystery of the Resurrection. As to events in the East
               we also have certain know<pb n="326"/>ledge of the same things that were also stated
               in your letter: and nothing beyond. Nevertheless the pangs caused by the impiety
               compel us to bring the foul birth out. It rests therefore with you, saintly men, and
               with all who love God to make supplication and to stir up your fervent prayers like a
               censer, and cast upon them "fine composite incense" <note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"> Ex. xxx. 7.</note>
               which is earnest and laborious supplication, supplication that at the same time
               reminds the divine ears of their wonders from eternity and is able to stop the
               corruption so that the Lord's congregation may not utterly perish, and the peoples
               say, "Where is their God?" <note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks"
                  rend="footer"> Ps/ lxxxviii. 10.</note> As to <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2752">Silvanus</persName> who is of heretical
               ordination, but begs to be received, you ought not to be in difficulty seeing that
               the regulations of the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1507"
                  >Timothy</persName>
               <note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"> Cf. pp. 320,
                  339</note> have marked out the proper course for you, and have laid down for you
               the method to be followed in this case: so that everything that goes beyond and
               surpasses him falls outside the limits of what is proper. However it will rest with
               you who are at hand and know the man to shorten or lengthen his time according to the
               character of his repentance. If possible therefore, the God-loving <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2545">Isidore</persName> bishop of the <placeName>
                  city of the Chalcidians<!--Chalcis not in the database--></placeName> will release
               this man. But, if it is thought that this will stir up affliction to his bonds, as
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">the Apostle</persName> says, <note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"> Ph. i. 16</note> it
               is easy for him to go with a letter from you to the God-loving <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2643">Epimachus</persName> bishop of
                  <placeName>Rhinocorura <!--Rhinocorura not in the database--></placeName>, and
               receive forgiveness. Only beware <pb n="327"/> lest, when the man is forgiven, he use
               the freedom as an assistance in causing disturbance in various places, since such is
               the character that you ascribe to him in your letter. As to <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2679">John</persName> of blessed memory the reader
               and our scribe, I should perhaps have been sorry that he did not come to see me and
               was prevented from undertaking the daring journey which would have been in the winter
               and is full of dangers, had it not been that he met with such an end of life, and a
               gathering-place for which one might well pray and a holy tabernacle (I will not say
               grave), it being one that foreshadowed for him rest in the eternal mansions. We pray
               also that through your holy prayers he may receive the lot of the saints in all its
               fulness. However both he and the devout <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2710">Sergius</persName> the reader when they came
               here injured many persons more than they edified them. One might hear them relating
               certain dreams and prophecies, on account of which, as they said, they hesitated to
               communicate with the holy churches in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715"
                  >Egypt</placeName>. From whom he heard these things I do not wish to say, lest I
               even seem to certain persons to be a hard man. Who is there who will not (and very
               rightly) pronounce against us as senseless, if we set ourselves against such
               prophecies and dreams, and while occupying ecclesiastical thrones forget these
               things, but, when we are outside and are expelled and driven out, again attend to
               dreams and repeat dreamy prophecy? However, since it is not my pleasure to make
               accusations, but to declare and explain to those <pb n="328"/> who love me what my
               position is, and proclaim it also to the adversaries, the communion that now prevails
               in the persecuted church of the East and in all the <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715">Egypt</placeName>ian church, and is pure in the
               proclamation of the faith, and in the rejection of the evil Chalcedonian impiety, and
               in purging itself of heretics and holding no association with them, this communion I
               so hold and to it I so draw near, as I drew near in it with the highest assurance

                  <foreign>πληρoφoρια</foreign></note> and a fixed mind, when our holy father
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/680">Peter</persName> the bishop from
                  <placeName>Iberia <!--Iberia not in database--></placeName> was offering, and was
               performing the rational sacrifice. We did not by our concession give anything like
               what we received. We waived the strict observance of names according to the fathers'
               ordinances for the sake of the salvation of so many cities, and instead of it we
               obtained besides the East the whole of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715"
                  >Egypt</placeName> also supporting us and ranging itself on our side with a pure
               heart, and not bound in a yoke with unbelievers, to speak in the words of <persName
                  ref=" http://syriaca.org/person/1983">the Apostle</persName>. <note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"> 2 Co. vi. 14</note>
               Having cast this seed, we gained for fruits banishment of bishops: confession on the
               part of cities: martyr-like contests, such that men reckon every kind of torture
               small. This is to be seen not only in men, but also in women and in every sex, and
               every age: insomuch that the inhabitants of the whole of <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/715">Egypt</placeName> are ready to strip themselves
               for like contests, if the time summon. What manner of man then were we when we had
               these things granted us, a man deprived of bishops <pb n="329"/> and sitting in a
               corner, and resembling a pelican of the wilderness as the prophet sings, <note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"> Ps. ci. 7.</note> and
               possessing a fruitless accuracy, insomuch that some were eager to proceed to new and
               different divisions? But God, knowing clearly that our holy fathers and His true
               servants always endeavoured to walk in the royal road, cut away these things and made
               them cease as if they had never begun at all, and instead of them by invisible means
               bestowed upon us riches that we had never desired or been able to conceive in our
               mind. He exposed the feebleness of human thoughts and efforts, but by means of facts
               themselves said, "For what the holy God hath purposed who shall annul? and His high
               hand who shall turn away?"<note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks"
                  rend="footer"> Is. xiv. 27.</note> How then shall we be found speaking in a
               contrary sense, we whose duty it is to exhort those who communicate with us to show
               freedom of speech regarding these things? Indeed according to my information the
               wonderful <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2436">Mitras</persName> showed
               himself more irrational even than irrational things by continually saying that he is
               not in communion with the holy churches here, and gave ground for laughter to those
               who have no soundness of their own, but apply themselves to find for themselves lines
               of defence and discoveries of methods of support from the weaker brethren among us,
               because he could not give a reason for this irrationality (I will not say "doubt").

                  ix. 1-6.</note> illegally receive bishops who have been canonically repudiated and

               think that they are practising religion: men, whom God has rendered more naked than a
               pebble as the text of Proverbs says, as their evil disposition deserves: men who have
               fallen so far into conflict with God as to presume to anathematize the Edict, under
               which, as those men say in so many words, the followers of <persName

               after <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2774">Timothy</persName>, unto this
               day, and went into the church with him; not knowing that they are laying under an
               anathema men whom, as they think, they ascribe to themselves as their fathers. For
               how is it that, the right confession being contained in the Edict, they sought to
               have that which is wanting added, i.e. a rejection of the Synod of <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName>, and when this was not
               added withdrew from communion? If the Edict deserved an anathema, they ought never to
               have assented to this at the beginning: but have demanded that it also be repudiated,
               like one of the repudiated doctrines. So great is the lack of instruction and the
               desire of amassing money: an object <pb n="331"/> that "blinds" even "the eyes of the
               wise," as the sacred text says, <note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks"

               sister, making their cheeks red by constant feastings, and presenting them swollen
               with fat to those that meet them, and not hiding themselves at all. The good

                     ><foreign>πληρoφoρια</foreign></note> communicated with the holy church in
                  <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName>, claiming to
               draw prophecies from that fat belly of his: but, when the prophecy failed to be
               fulfilled, he changed his tack and acted as a suppliant to those who had received his
               menaces. Having fallen in with them on the road, he knelt down and kept begging those
               who had been threatened to give him forgiveness, and only to return to communion with
               him. But they after laughing for a long time left him lying on the ground his
               prophecies and all. I pray your sanctities to be assured that a certain quiet man who
               had received such a threat from him, after communicating the knowledge to the holy
               church and accepting its help in considering what was best to do, by God's permission
               was smitten with bright tumours on the side, which many are in the habit of naming
               carbuncles. He, coming up to me (for he was one of those who know our affairs),
               begged me to touch the afflicted part: and I, beginning to weep, applied to it the
               chrism of the holy cross, and its <pb n="332"/> venerated sign; and I sent this man
               away expecting to die. And on the next day the Lord of hosts made the swelling caused
               by the tumours to disappear, and he did not keep his bed for one single hour: but,
               going about and following his usual pursuits, he was delivered from the affliction,
               "walking and leaping and praising God"; <note

               for the sacred scripture will again express this also. But, if I have become a fool
               by relating this, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2602">Anatolius</persName>
               the false prophet compelled me, even as the false apostles did <persName

               though I am not <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName>, and
               am a sinner, yet not a breaker of the law or the canons, but an observer of the law
               of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName>. <note

               Many other things also might have been related, which expose the foolishness of those
               men, but confirm the power of the truth: but the limits of a letter are not suited
               for such stories, seeing that they need the extended range of oral conversation. For
               the same <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2602">Anatolius</persName> thought
               fit to say to certain men, "<persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2659"
                  >Hosius</persName> an old man, in whom alone I had confidence, who also" (he says)
               "gave me the monastic garb, used to urge me, when I came to <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/698">Palestine</placeName>, to communicate with the
               bishop of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">city of the
                  Antiochenes</placeName>, saying that he placed confidence in him. But, when" (he
               says) "I for my part went on to ask him whether I ought also to communicate with the
               bishop of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">city of the
                  Alexandrines</placeName>, he answered that I ought not to do this. But I" (he
               says), "laughing at the contrariety and inconsistency of the words, declined <pb
                  n="333"/> to follow the advice." And many other falsehoods he tells. To women too
               he was to be seen prophesying, and presumptuously laying threats upon them, while not
               getting anything else from such practices but laughter only. However he does not
               perceive things that are of a nature to cause shame, because he takes his pleasure in
               loaves of bread and cooked dishes and various drinks that are offered him, and feeds
               his belly only. For this has in fact been his object for a long time. To such an
               extent did the good and excellent <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2436"
                  >Mitras</persName> (for to him I return) use words without sense, that I almost
               even forgot my caution, and even asked to meet and speak with him, and prevent him
               from being shaken: but I have not been able to find a way of doing so, since the
               necessity that surrounds me hinders the accomplishment of my wish. For he put forward
               one and another counter-argument of contemptible character, swimming and tossing (?)
               in his own fatuities and driven hither and thither at random. Among these one is
               this. They used in fact to say of us that we communicated with <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/744">Simeon</persName> who stood on the pillar: and
               against those who laid down this counter-argument some of our supporters brought
               forward the truth and said, "Accordingly on your principle <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1507">Timothy </persName> also of holy memory will
               rightly incur blame in this matter, if one does not take into account considerations
               of expediency concerning the holy churches and the necessity of joining and binding
               them together. For indeed he also is shown to have sent clergymen to <pb n="334"/>
               the East: who communicated with <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2474"
                  >Peter</persName> who at that time held the prelacy of the <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">city of the Antiochenes</placeName>, bringing
               with them a synodical letter, And, after all the names had been read, the bearers of
               this communicated in the oblation: one among whom was the man called <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2583">Achillas</persName>." Then they out of
               contentiousness falsely disputed and said that <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2583">Achillas</persName> had orders to remove the
               names, and he did not do as he was ordered, and after his return to <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName> was visited with
               punishment and separation. But the fiction was refuted by the fact that <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>ene clergymen had come at
               that time to the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">city of the
                  Alexandrines</placeName> to buy wheat, <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</placeName> being afflicted with lack of
               wheat, and exercised the ministry here and communicated in the sacred oblation. And
               again those audacious men said, "why did I pronounce a laudatory discourse about him,
               when I ought to have held my peace, and to have given effect to the considerations of
               expediency by silence?" In answer to this I said to those who spoke, "The
                  <foreign>prooimion</foreign> or preface of the discourse shows the whole truth.
               Because the unholy Nestorians, whose leader was <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/781">Theodoret</persName>, wished to snatch for
               themselves the splendour of the man's character, and to attach this to the heresy, I
               in composing the discourse made the true statement that he actually drove away
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/781">Theodoret</persName> and said that
               he did not even know the Synod: but that he believed in the Father and <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">the Son</persName> and the Holy Spirit. I
               added this argument also, which is very true, that a man who did not know letters did
               not <pb n="335"/> sign: and those who have grown old in the flock and yet survive
               showed this by many proofs. And in order to exclude the impiety I made this manifest
               in the discourse, and prevented the deception of the believing peoples who by this
               plea were being brought to what the heretics desired, and were spurning the substance
                  <note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer">
                  <foreign>κεφαλαιον</foreign></note> of the sound faith." So far said I. But I find
               that the holy fathers also defend conspicuous men who are capable of attracting many
               by their reputation, and this while knowing that those men did not keep the accuracy
               of the faith, whom they enthusiastically and with many praises defended. Such was the
               conduct of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/354">Athanasius</persName> when
               he wrote on behalf of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2634"
                  >Dionysius</persName> against the Arians,<note

                     ><foreign>νποληψις</foreign></note> of the man in support of their heresy. The
               purpose of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/354">Athanasius</persName> that
               made him compose the defence and the encomium was very plain: and this was, not to
               give the adversaries a chance of priding themselves upon him, and of putting forward
               the glory of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2634">Dionysius</persName> as a
               covering for their evil belief. <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/376"
                  >Basil</persName> the great, as you know, in writing to <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2704">Maximus</persName> the philosopher utters a
               pronouncement about <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2634"
                  >Dionysius</persName>, in which he says these words: "Wherefore also he is
               many-coloured in his writings: now taking away the co-essentiality, on account of him
               who uses it in an evil way for the destruction of the substances, now accepting it
               and making a defence to his name<pb n="336"/>sake. In addition to these things he has
               regarding the Holy Spirit also left utterances that do not at all beseem a spiritual
               man, exiling Him from the adorable Godhead, and reckoning Him with created and
               ministering nature in some lower place."<note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer">Ep. 9. 2.</note> What
               then? When we hear these things, shall we bring a just accusation against <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/354">Athanasius</persName> on the ground that by
               his defence he extolled and praised a man who thus fell from the right standard of
               accuracy? or shall we accept him the more on account of this high spiritual service
               of his and the skilful policy by which he did not allow the Arians to pride
               themselves in such a man and thereby hurl the more simple down into the pit? In all
               things the methods and actions of the fathers were directed to the end that the
               orthodox faith might be spread abroad and that this might prevail in the churches,
               and to the end that they might hinder the plots of the heretics, and might bar every
               opening for deceit against them, and that they might remove the stones from the royal
               road that no one might go astray. I have given vent to these utterances, — I have
               grieved in my spirit as it is somewhere written <note
