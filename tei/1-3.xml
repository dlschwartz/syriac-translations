               bishop and metropolitan of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/182"
                  >Seleucia</placeName> in <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/99"

               24th letter.</head>
            <p> The letter of your religiousness was enough to bring even those who are not easily
               roused to wrath into a state of anger and indignation. But for our. part, because we
               are accustomed to endure such things philosophically, especially when they are done
               and <pb n="17"/> said by honoured and beloved men like you, we have thought it right
               in this instance also not to strive with contentious words, but rather, as far as
               possible, in consonance with the actual truth to write such things as are in accord
               with the judgments of <persName>God</persName>, and to show that we are free from all
               cause of blame on your part. <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459"
                  >Callistus</persName> was not dragged before us by anyone upon any new charges
               being made against him by you. Then he would have had ground for complaint, inasmuch
               as discipline would, as you say, have been violated, and a judgment and cause<note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer">νπόφεσις.</note> that
               belonged to the holy throne of the metropolitan would have been forcibly removed
               before examination or pardon by being called up, as one may say, to the exaltation
               and height of the patriarchal and apostolic throne. But, if the matters upon which
               the party of
                  <persName>Hilarian<!--he is mentioned in other people's entries but doen't have one of his own-->
               </persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2571">Musonius</persName>
               made charges against <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459"
                  >Callistus</persName> were examined and investigated while your holiness was in
               this great city, how comes it that the transaction does not lie beyond the reach of
               your objections? Nay, how can you avoid praising us if you again recall to your
               memory how I turned benevolent ears to such faults, and to the bitter attacks of the
               accusers, and that with much wise moderation we tempered the vehemence of those men,
               and the gravity of the accusations in which he was involved; and that after this we
               further in some sort sent a request, which otherwise would not have beseemed us, to
               each of the bishops, asking them, <pb n="18"/> inasmuch as he had repented, to vote
               unanimously for the forgiveness which was to be granted him; and, upon our showing
               such solicitude, he received letters from each of the bishops, and we received these
               with joy, and immediately the things written were read, and the decree of pardon
               followed? But, as for the matter which is now thought by
                  <persName>Hilarian</persName> to be connected with the same subject,<note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer">νπόφεσις.</note> how
               will it be suited for the hearing of your love of <persName>God</persName>, and that
               when the sin was directed against me, I mean that of the forged letter? For I do not
               know if anyone else among men, or an angel from heaven, will come and disprove its
               spuriousness, seeing that its prejudice is so manifest, and that
                  <persName>Hilarian</persName>'s handwriting also, when compared with his other
               signatures, utters, so to speak, a voice and proclaims the fiction. Therefore look
               into these things with carefulness and sincere <persName>God</persName>-loving
               thought, and consider whether you are not making a preposterous request, viz., that
               the patriarch should receive judgment from your love of <persName>God</persName> in a
               case of insults or sins that were directed against him, and that in the words sung by
               everyone you may turn things upside down; and whether we ourselves have not now the
               right to use your words, "I am insulted and contemned." I forbear to mention that,
               even after the conviction from the letter, <persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName>, the
                  <persName>God</persName>-loving bishop of the city of the <persName>Olbians
                  <!--Olbia is not on the site--></persName>, came here, and bore witness and said
               that <persName>Hilarian</persName> said in the presence of his love of
                  <persName>God</persName> that <pb n="19"/> with <persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2571">Musonius</persName>' assent he wrote that
               the diaconate ought to be restored to <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459"
                  >Callistus</persName>, but that he should not in addition be archdeacon also, and
               hold the first place.<note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks"
                  rend="footer">Cf. p. 31.</note> But what is the modest defence to these things,
               which is given even by your sanctity (for this is the wonderful thing)? "<persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2459">Callistus</persName> is not subject to
               reproof for saying of himself that he does not communicate with us in the matter of
               the mention of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person?2409"
                  >Peter<!--I'm like 95% sure this is the guy-->
               </persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2473">Palladius</persName>,
               who are by a violation of strict accuracy named in the sacred tablets, and in the
               matter of communion with the <persName>God</persName>-loving bishop of the city of
               the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/place/122">Hierapolitans</placeName>,
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/pers/2574">Philoxenus</persName>, who names a

                  resp="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName>." May the all-holy soul
               of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1839">Constantine</persName> hear these
               words, against whom that wicked man armed himself, both by writing to those on the
               other side and by creeping into the archive-house, and arming and inciting the
                  governor<note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"
                     ><foreign>ήγμών.</foreign></note> of the province<note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"
                     ><foreign>έπαρχία.</foreign></note> to do everything that could bow down his
               venerable old age and subvert the orthodox faith! For so much did he infuriate him, I
               mean the governor of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/99">Isauria</placeName>
               at that time, that death alone put a stop to his fury against piety. May <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2417">Solon</persName> also, who succeeded to
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person1839">Constantine</persName>'s see, hear
               these words! and let him hold <persName resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2459"
                  >Callistus</persName> as a teacher of zeal for strict accuracy, because after
               intolerable impieties he has of his own accord come forth as an unlawful champion on
               behalf of the laws of the church, one who sprang suddenly from the ground <pb n="20"
               /> like the giants fabled in legends. However let <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459">Callistus</persName> stand upon this peak,
               there is no objection, and let <persName resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2417"
                  >Solon</persName> go up with him. Only let them stay in this citadel, and not
               immediately come down and say, 'All the cities of <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/99">Isauria</placeName> have also introduced into
               the sacred tablets the names of those who unlawfully signed at <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/622">Chalcedon</placeName>"; for it is time for me
               also to say what the well-disposed robber, who was crucified with our Lord and
               Saviour <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName>, said to the
               blasphemous robber, "Dost not even thou fear <persName>God</persName>, seeing thou
               art in the same judgment?" These things we for our part say out of an abundant
               choice. But anyone who makes a careful investigation will find that your love of
                  <persName>God</persName> has not maintained the order of things which you took
               over from <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1839">Constantine</persName> the
               metropolitan who is among the saints, but that your feathers have gradually fallen
               off after the manner of a bird, while our meanness has carried out a gradual
               progress, and has in no way fallen short of the beginning previously made. Indeed
               every one of those who were ordained by us, whether he incurred dangers or was free
               from danger, removed the names under suspicion. For neither is the statement made by
               your religiousness true, I mean that the <persName>God</persName>-loving Mammian
               bishop of the city of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/66"
                  >Damascenes</placeName> mentions the name of one who signed. Immediately upon his
               setting foot in the city. and sacrificing the first sacrifice and at the same time
               with it he offered to <persName>God</persName> the legal omission of his <pb n="21"/>
               name. But the omission of the mention of such men as <persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2409">Peter <!--same as before-->
               </persName> and <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2473">Palladius</persName>
               we for our part have for the present not promised to any man. The things that must be
               yielded to junctions or general unions of <persName>God</persName>'s holy churches
               are both regulated and defined, and we never stretch ourselves to things outside the
               bounds of moderation, "being vainly puffed up," as the apostle says, and wandering
               outside the royal road. If we had in the beginning yielded this difficulty in these
               other names to you who did this, but had stopped at this one only, that of those who
               signed as you say several times, how could I on my own authority have laid either
               upon myself-or upon those who have in no way attained to this strictness "heavy
               burdens and grievous to be borne," according to the Gospel saying, which injure the
               right teaching of the faith and upset everything owing to the stress and difficulty
               of the present time? The things done in the case of <persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person2459">Callistus</persName> are therefore as stated
               above. But your love of <persName>God</persName> ought also to reflect upon the
               accusations that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2571">Musonius</persName>
               and <persName>Hilarian</persName> brought in the case of the devout <persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2652">Eustace</persName>, and how we for our part
               dealt with the affair in a proper way and in a seemly fashion; and to see with your
               eyes how honourable is the place that you hold before us, though you show an
               appearance of forgetting. Indeed I know clearly that in the matters in which it is my
               duty to trouble my mind: have not relaxed at all But, if any man seeks to be burdened
                  <pb n="22"/> by <persName>God</persName>'s laws, "we have no such custom, neither
               the churches of <persName>God</persName>." But may the <persName>Lord</persName> be
               witness. for me of my words and of the feelings of my heart, that I am still even now
               praying that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459">Callistus</persName> may
               be found upon manifest proofs to be innocent of the charges made against him, as the
               previous proceedings also and the various measures taken by me in his case showed!
               But, if he shall neglect the right road of defence and take refuge in an accuracy of
               names that does not exist, and in the fact that he does not communicate with us, it
               is time for me to say to him appropriately the words of <persName>Jeremiah
                  <!--of the Bible--></persName>, "'If thou whiten thyself with natron and take thee
               much soap, thy sins have scarred thee before me' saith the
               <persName>Lord</persName>." But neither will the religious
                  <persName>Hilarian</persName> escape from the strict execution of the canons, if
               he be proved to be lying. A certain term of days has been fixed for him, and this has
               been set down in writing; and, if he fail to appear and make no defence to the
               accusation against him, <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459"
                  >Callistus</persName> will be released from the interdict, and the position of a
               man under a charge will rightly pass to him, as disturbing the discipline of the
               Church. <add><emph>And after other things.</emph></add> But you must believe that,
               after I had given the letter to the devout <persName
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person/2758">Stephen</persName>, something that had been
               omitted came into my mind, I mean, to tell you the time within which the religious
               bishop <persName>Hilarian</persName> is to come, or else the things stated in the
               letter about <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2459">Callistus</persName> and
               about him will be carried <pb n="23"/> out. The time is reckoned from to-day, and
               extends to the end of the month of September. </p>
