            <p> For my part I thought that the negligence and sloth that has grown old with me, and
               the sleep of sins from which up to the present day I have not been roused, were
               unknown to the majority of men, but known to <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> only, "who knoweth the
               hearts," and makes "light the hidden things of darkness," and reveals the thoughts
               that are in the mind. But you by naming me a city set upon a height have caused me an
               increase of tears, if I not only injure myself by my <pb n="276"/> forgetfulness, but
               also make myself a bad example to others who know me. The holy scripture knows of
               such cities also and evil powers, and men who regard impiety, whose memory the
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord</persName> destroyed with
               tumult. However, I considered that you were led by love and your faith towards
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName> to write thus,
               though you distressed my wretchedness. But, concerning the other part of your letter,
               I was much grieved: and I prayed that the earth might open for me, seeing that you
               have dared to open a blaspheming mouth against the saint and archbishop <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2129">Timothy</persName>, the preserver of the
               orthodox faith, who was left as a remnant and a root for
                  <placeName>Israel</placeName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Place Search -->,
               enduring long exiles, and bearing <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
                  >Christ's</persName> marks in him. What cause of blame is there, tell me, in the
               fact of his receiving canonically upon repentance those who were ordained by
               heretics, when they anathematized their heresy in writing? Are you not in the habit
               of hearing that <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1919">Melitus</persName>,
               the archbishop of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/10">Antioch</placeName>,
               was ordained by <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2486">Arians</placeName>,
               and that he afterwards showed himself an approved champion of orthodoxy, insomuch
               that he was thought worthy to suffer many things, and put on the crown of confession?
               What then? Did those who received this man at that time and honoured him with tens of
               thousands of praises, one of whom was the great <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/376">Basil</persName>, also praise or receive the
               man who ordained him, holding as he did Arian opinions? Nay, him they justly
               repudiated as having remained in the nets <pb n="277"/> of <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2486">Arius</persName>, while they admired
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1919">Melitus</persName> as having by
               repentance purged away the dregs of heresy and combated on behalf of orthodoxy. But
               you say that the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2129"
                  >Timothy</persName> contradicted himself, seeing that at first he said that those
               who had been ordained should not be received, but at a later time received them.
               Being an old man and without learning and uninstructed I acquiesce in what you say.
               However, we find that the holy apostles also showed similar self-contradiction. For
               instance <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2008">Peter</persName>, though he
               was in the habit of preaching the gospel to those of the circumcision only, and did
               not go on to preach to those of the nations also, because he thought it to be
               "unlawful to approach or join himself to anyone of another race," afterwards, when he
               had received a revelation from <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
                  >God</persName>, said, "<persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
                  >God</persName> hath showed me also not to call any man common and unclean": and
               again, "<persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> also who
               knoweth the hearts bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit even as unto us,
               and put no difference between us and them." In such cases the purpose is approved
               though the things done are thought to appear in some way contradictory. But, that you
               may learn that it is not I only the uninstructed who say these things, I remember to
               have heard a discourse of the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2686"
                  >John</persName>, bishop of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2290"
                  >Constantinople</placeName>, read: and I have now again looked for the book, and
               have copied some sentences from it for your affection, which give us an example
               bearing upon this <pb n="278"/> present subject, that we are not to be scandalized
               without reason. The discourse in which the holy man writes these things is the
               encomium on <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName> the
               Apostle: and he speaks thus: "So neither would <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName> have been known to imitate
               his <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord</persName>, except that he
               became now a Jew, now as one not under the law. For now he would keep the law: now he
               would neglect the law. And at one time he would cleave to the life here; at another
               again he would despise it. And now he would ask for money: now he would refuse it
               even when given. And he would sacrifice, and shave: and again he would anathematize
               the doers of these things. And now he would circumcize: now he would reject
               circumcision. And the things done were contradictory: but the thought and intention
               from which these proceeded was very consistent and consonant with itself. For he
               sought one thing, the salvation of those who saw and heard these things. For this
               reason now he would keep the law: now he would subvert it. For it was not only in
               what he did, but also in what he said that he was versatile and rich in expedients:
               not being changed in his mind, nor passing from one disposition to another, but
               remaining that which he was, and treating each of the said matters in accordance with
               the need of the time. Do not therefore speak evil of him on account of these things,
               but celebrate and crown him the more on account of these things. For in fact in the
               case of a physician also, when you see him now burning now feeding; and using now
               iron now medicine; and now prohibiting foods <pb n="279"/> and drinks, now allowing
               the patient to enjoy these without stint; and at one time restricting him on all
               sides, at another ordering the man who has been seized with fever to drink a glass
               full of cold water, you do not blame him for the variation, nor because of the
               perpetual change: but you will then praise the technical skill the more, because you
               see it boldly applying methods that seem to us contradictory and hurtful, and
               pledging itself for a safe result. For such is the man of technical skill. But, if we
               accept a physician when he does these contradictory. things, much more must we
               celebrate the soul of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName>,
               which approached those in trouble in this way." So far the holy <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2686">John</persName>: but I wish to say one other
               thing which also springs from rusticity and an uninstructed mind. I consider that all
               the bishops throughout the earth who are bound together with one another in the
               orthodox faith and combined in union are one. For all follow the model of one, of the
               great <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> and our Saviour
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Jesus Christ</persName>. Therefore,
               as, when <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2498">Cyprian</persName> in
                  <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1178">Africa</placeName> with the synod
               under him said that all who had been baptized by heresy ought to receive the laver of
                     <sic><reg>regeneration</reg><orig>regenertion</orig></sic>, as if they had
               never originally been baptized at all, but at last the opinion of <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/22">Sixtus</persName> of <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2360">Rome</placeName>, and of <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2634">Dionysius</persName> of <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572">Alexandria</placeName> and of the others
               prevailed, so that those who had been baptized by heretics in the name of the three
               substances, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, were not re-baptized, no one of
               sound <pb n="280"/> intelligence said that those saintly bishops contradicted
               themselves, but that upon later consideration they chose a better and more canonical
               course, so also the holy <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2129"
                  >Timothy</persName> too at first, owing to the blasphemy and the impenitent heart
               of the Proterians as it was at the beginning, and the zeal of the orthodox people of
               the city of the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/572"
                  >Alexandrines</placeName>, said that he would not accept those who had been
               ordained by the opposite party: but at last, when they canonically repented and he
               lawfully accepted them, he did not show himself self-contradictory, but rather very
               consistent, since he said those things on account of the zeal of the believers, but
               allowed the canons to prevail, and accepted those who repented in accordance with the
               final conclusions of the fathers, and further by signing the Encyclical united
               himself to all the bishops in the world. Though these things seem contradictory to
               many, yet nevertheless their one purpose was the salvation of those who had perished,
               and that those who stood upright might not under the influence of immoderate zeal
               leave the royal road, and turn away to that which is rather on the right side.
               Therefore, you that are beloved on account of our Lord <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Jesus</persName>, do not out of ignorance
               injure your soul: but hear me the unlearned and uninstructed, and do not revile the
               man of <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName>, with whom all
               the fathers were satisfied at that time, not having received the satisfaction that is
               from men, but that which is from <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
                  >God</persName>: and I the mean and sinful <pb n="281"/> am, as I persuade myself,
               no false witness of this. We did not love <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2129">Timothy</persName> as having been crucified
               for us, as you say, but as having been a true bondservant of Him who was of His own
               accord crucified for the race of men, and a faithful and wise steward of <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God's</persName> mysteries: who also
               contended against the heresy of the Diphysites or Nestorians, and the impious
               phantasy of the Eutychianists, proclaiming <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1019">Emmanuel</persName> to be one nature out of
               two, the Godhead that is and the manhood, and the same of one essence with the Father
               in the Godhead, and of one essence with us men in the manhood. For He took of the
               seed of
               <persName>Abraham</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography search -->
               and was made like us His brethren in all things except sin, in order that He might
               redeem those who were under sin, and might save us by His blood, and we might
               thenceforth be called a holy people, inasmuch as we were created by the blood of
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName>, who suffered for us
               in the flesh and remained impassible. Let your beloved person know that to all who
               came to my pitifulness of the holy fathers in <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/1531">Pamphylia</placeName>, and of the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Christ</persName>-loving laymen, I read what
               was written to me by you: and each of them urged me to write to you many things taken
               from the doctors who were eminent at various times in the church. For some of them
               actually knew you at the time when <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2741"
                  >Promotus</persName> the count, whose soul is at rest, was living in the royal
               city: with whom you perhaps in fact discussed these things. But for my part, seeing
               that <pb n="282"/> as an uninstructed and unlearned man I avoid many words, I have
               sent you in an epistle the fruit of my rusticity: having besought the merciful
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> to place in you the
               wisdom which is gentle and obedient, in respect of the things that have been written
               by me. May the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord</persName> of
               peace and of tranquillity grant us peace and tranquillity at all times and in all
               ways! </p>
