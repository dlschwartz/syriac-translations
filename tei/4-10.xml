            <p> Out of piety that loves instruction you ask whether some of the orthodox are doing
               well in not communicating with the heretics, but listening to the reading of the holy
               Gospel, or even staying during the time of the mysterious prayers, but not
               communicating in the rites that are being performed. To those who are not ignorant of
               the divine laws the answer is manifest. <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1826">John the Evangelist</persName>, the speaker
               of divine things, wrote: [Here follows the citation given on p. 263]. If then it is
               not right to offer even a bare greeting to those who bring another teaching and do
               not teach <pb n="273"/> the orthodox faith, how can one communicate in prayers and in
               lessons or in any other such things with such men as these? And <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/1983">Paul</persName> the wise commands us to turn
               away even the very face from those who are in servitude to heresy, writing thus to
                  <persName>Titus</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search -->:
               [Here follows the citation given on p. 264]. He therefore who joins in assembly with
               the guilty renders himself subject to the same judgment. Nay even the holy canons of
               the Church have manifestly repudiated the principle of a man praying with heretics.
               For the hundred and thirty-fifth canon says; "It is not right to receive the
                  blessings<note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer"
                  >ευλoγíaς</note> of heretics, which are rather no-blessings and not blessings."
               And there immediately follows the hundred and thirty-sixth also, which says; "It is
               not right to pray with heretics or schismatics."<note
                  resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer">Mansi ii. 570.</note>
               These statements give the strict rule. But, when I the mean one, as far as my mean
               knowledge extends, consider the broadness of the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName>-inspired scripture, I find
               that men who hold ministerial posts or high offices, and are obliged to accompany and
               attend upon rulers, receive an indulgence, if, when they go in with them and hear a
               lesson and prayers, they keep themselves perfect: I mean if they do not communicate
               in the communion from which they are divided. For instance in the fourth Book of
               Kingdoms there is something like this written. A certain captain of the host of the
               King of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/486">Syria</placeName> of <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2294">Damascus</placeName>, by name
                  <persName>Naaman</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search -->,
               who was a leper, went to the prophet <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2640"
                  >Elisha</persName>, and received <pb n="274"/> cleansing from his affliction. And
               through his healing he recognised the one and only true <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> of
                  <placeName>Israel</placeName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Place Search -->,
               the Maker and Creator of all, and spurned the falsely-named gods and his fathers'
               worship and error. And, when he was about to return to his own country, he said to
               the prophet that he would no more look upon the strange gods and vain demons, "But,"
               he says, "although the King of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/486"
                  >Syria</placeName> go into the temple of the demon in their country who is called
                  <persName>Rimmon</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search -->,
               and I also go in with him to do him honour and to support him with my hand, I will
               worship the true <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> in my
               heart, and I will recognise Him only, but I will not communicate with the king in the
               error and worship the demon with him. Only" (he says) "pray for me, that <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName> may be gracious to me in this
               thing also on account of necessity." And the prophet was silent and did not praise or
               blame: but by silence he followed a middle line and gave him indulgence: and, having
               invoked peace upon him, he sent him away. But it is well that we cite also the actual
               words of the divine scripture, which
               <persName>Naaman</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search -->
               spoke to the prophet himself, which run as follows: "Thy slave will no more perform a
               burnt-offering or a sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord</persName> only. And in this thing the
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord</persName> will be gracious to
               thy slave, when my <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">lord</persName>
               goeth into the house of
               <persName>Rimmon</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search --> to
               worship him there, because he leaneth upon my hands. And, when he worshippeth in the
               house of
               <persName>Rimmon</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search -->, I,
               being with him, will worship the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord
                  God.</persName> And the <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245"
                  >Lord</persName> will be gracious to thy slave in <pb n="275"/> this thing. And
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2640">Elisha</persName> said to
                  <persName>Naaman</persName><!-- Could not be found in Syriac Biography Search -->,
               "Go in peace."<note resp="http://syriaca.org/person.xml#ewbrooks" rend="footer">a R.
                  v. 17-19.</note> Therefore, seeing that your glorious devoutness knows these
               things, I pray that with pure and sincere faith you may walk in the <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">Lord's</persName> paths both in deed and in
               word. For besides your other excellencies I admire also your practice of reading and
               meditating on the divine words, the fruits and flowers of which are displayed in your
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2245">God</persName>-loving letters,
               which gladden those before whom they come. </p>
