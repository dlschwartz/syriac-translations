         <head>The Plan of the Book [of Paradise]</head>
         <p>In this book are written the excellent deeds and the marvellous lives of the holy and
            blessed Fathers, who took upon themselves the yoke of the solitary life, and who made
            themselves to be remote from the world, and who lived in the desert, and who wished to
            live wholly the heavenly life, and to travel on the road which leadeth unto the kingdom
            of heaven. Let us emulate their example and endeavour to do with all our might what they
            did! And together with these we commemorate also the marvellous women who led their
            lives in the Divine Spirit, and who waxed exceedingly old, and who with a brave mind
            brought to an end the strife of the labours of spiritual excellence, according to the
            Divine manifestation and ove, for they wished to lay hold upon their souls, and to bind
            [upon their heads] the crown of holiness and impassibility.</p>
         <p>And as for myself, (because of the sweet manners of the man by whom I have been
            commanded [to write], whose mind is full of doctrine (or learning), whose habits are
            those of a lover of peace, who feareth God in his heart, who loveth <persName>Christ</persName> in his mind,
            who in the things which are needful is an associate, and who, because of all these
            qualities, hath been chosen from among many, and hath been honoured with the highest
            rank of all), being protected by the might of the Holy Spirit—especially if it be right
            to speak the truth—I would rouse up our heavy minds to the contemplation of the things
            which are spiritually excellent, so that we may strive to imitate the most excellent
            lives and deeds of the pious men, and of the immortal and spiritual fathers, whose lives
            in the flesh were passed in laborious and stern service and in pleasing God. Of the
            virtues of such athletes of the fear of God it is my desire to set down some account in
            writing and to send it to thee, and I would make clear in my discourse the manifest
            spiritual excellences of each one of these great men. And he who loveth a divine and
            spiritual desire like unto this is thyself, <persName>Lausus</persName>, who art triumphant among men, and
            who, in accordance with the Divine nod, hast been established as the guardian of this
            kingdom which loveth <persName>Christ</persName>.</p>
         <p>But inasmuch as I have not been trained in language (or speech), and as I possess
            spiritual knowledge only in the very smallest degree, and am unequal to the task [of
            describing] the company of the holy Fathers and [their] spiritual lives and works, I am
            afraid of the greatness of [thy] command which surpasseth my capacity. I have,
            therefore, up to this present, been urging myself to escape (?) from this work, because
            I am in great need both of the wisdom which is [essential] externally and of spiritual
            understanding. But being put to shame first of all by the strenuousness of the
            excellence of him that stirred me up to [do] this work, and considering also the benefit
            which shall accrue to those who shall come across these histories, and being, moreover,
            afraid of the danger of the penalty of disobedience, which is right, I will first of all
            commit the weight of the matter unto the Providence of God, and I will, with all
            diligence, make use of the prayers of the holy Fathers, so that I may be able to mount
            up as upon wings to the place where their contests were waged, and may tell the story
            briefly of those athletes, who though young became great and divine men who did
            valiantly and who triumphed in the works and deeds of spiritual excellence. And I will
            also relate the histories of those blessed women who were adorned with the fair garb [of
            the monastic life], and who attained to pre-eminence in divine labours. Now some of
            these divine persons of whom I am about to tell the story I was held to be worthy to see
            face to face; and concerning the heavenly lives of the others who died in the contest of
            the fear of God I have learned from the athletes of <persName>Christ</persName>, who were arrayed in God.</p>
         <p>Therefore, through very many cities, and villages, and in caves and holes in the earth,
            and in the tabernacles which the monks had in the desert for a distance as far as a man
            could walk have I gone round about for the sake of the labour of the fear of God, and I
            have set down in writing with exactness the things which I have seen. And I have also
            made known unto thee in this book the things which I have heard from the holy Fathers
            concerning the triumphs of great men, and concerning the women who for the sake of the
            hope which is in <persName>Christ</persName> performed mighty works which were above nature, and I have sent
            it to thy hearing which loveth divine words. O thou <persName>Lausus</persName> who art triumphant among men,
            and who art fair among the friends of God, and who art the ornament of this believing
            and God-fearing kingdom, and art the true friend and servant of God, I have written down
            for thee as far as my feebleness is able, the [history of] the strife of each of the
            athletes of <persName>Christ</persName>, both male and female, a name which is honourable and which meriteth
            praise. And I have narrated unto thee only very few of the very many exceedingly great
            triumphs which belong to each one of these athletes, and of many of them I have added
            [the names of] their families and cities, and also the places where they lived.</p>
         <p>And we have also commemorated the men and women who, indeed, attained to the highest
            excellence in the labours of the spiritual life, and who, because of the pride (or
            arrogance), which is the mother of that [quality] which is called vainglory, were
            brought down to the lowest depths of <placeName>Sheol</placeName>, and so wasted the great work in the
            spiritual qualities which they had only acquired after a very long time, and the
            triumphs in the ascetic virtues which they had won, through [their] pride and boasting
            in one brief moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Nevertheless, by the Divine Grace of
            our Redeemer, and by the carefulness of <persName>the holy Fathers</persName>, and by the cherishing
            influence of the mercy of the Spirit, they were plucked [finally] out of the net of the
            Calumniator.</p>
