      <body>
         <head>The History of <persName>Macarius the Alexandrian</persName>, the Glorious</head>
         <p>As for the other <persName>Macarius, the Alexandrian</persName>, I did see him, for he
            was an elder in the place which is called the <quote>Cells,</quote> wherein I myself
            lived for nine years, and he lived for three years after I entered <pb n="172"/>therein;
            some of [his] wonderful acts I myself have seen, and some of them I have learned from
            others, and [of others] I have also heard rumours. Now his sad, stern life of
            self-denial was as follows: Whensoever he heard of any beautiful deed being done by any
            man whatsoever, he must straightway carry it into practice in a fuller form. He once
            heard from a certain man that all the brethren of <placeName>Tabenna</placeName> never
            tasted any food whatsoever which had been cooked by fire during the whole of the Forty
            Days’ Fast, and he straightway determined within himself that for seven years he would
            not eat any food which had been cooked by fire, and that he would not partake of
            anything except young wild herbs, and vegetables which had been made soft by soaking in
            water, or similar things. And when he had completed this rule of life he heard of a monk
            in a certain monastery who only ate one pound of bread each day, and he straightway
            broke his bread into pieces and cast it into a vessel with a narrow mouth, and he
            determined within himself that he would eat nothing that his hand could not draw up out
            of the vessel the first time [he put it in]. And time after time, he used to tell the
            story with a smile, and say, <quote>When I put my hand down I could fill it readily, but
               I could not draw it up full because the mouth of the vessel was [too] narrow, and it
               would not let me take it out full.</quote> Now he lived this hard life for three
            years, and ate [daily only] four or five ounces of bread; and of water also he only
            drank sufficient to enable him to eat his bread. Of oil [he took] only one flask each
            year, making use of it only on the great First Day of the Resurrection, and on the great
            day of Pentecost, and at the Nativity, and at the Epiphany, and when he received [the
            Mysteries] during the Forty Days’ Fast. I will tell also <pb n="173"/>of the various
            other practices of his sad, hard life. He determined [once] to vanquish sleep, and it is
            related that he never entered under a roof for twenty days, and that he was burnt up by
            the exceedingly great heat of the sun at noonday during all this time, and that during
            the nights he was without rest. And he himself told us, <quote>Had I not quickly gone in
               under a roof and slept, and rested myself the brains in my head would have dried up,
               and I should become like a drunk man. But,</quote> he would say, <quote>I have been
               conquered against my will, for although the nature of the body hath been overcome I
               have given it what it needeth.</quote></p>
         <p>And again, once when he was sitting in his cell a gnat bit him in the leg and he
            suffered pain, and he crushed the gnat in his hand and killed it. Then straightway he
            despised himself because he had avenged himself upon the gnat, and he passed upon
            himself the sentence that he should go to the place which is called
               <quote>Scete,</quote> that is to say, the inner desert, and sit there naked for six
            months. For there were many great gnats (i.e., mosquitoes) there, and they were so
            savage that they could pierce the skins of pigs, and they resembled wasps; and his whole
            body was so eaten and swollen that a man would have thought that he had the hide of an
            elephant, and when he came [back] to his cell six months later they could only recognize
            from his voice that he was <placeName>Macarius</placeName>.</p>
         <p>And again he desired greatly to go and see the garden of <persName>Jannes</persName> and
               <persName>Jambres</persName>, the magicians of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, because,
            as he himself told us, they had obtained power, and riches and dominion, and had built
            there a tomb, <pb n="174"/>and had established there great works in marble; now their
            tomb was ornamented with many things, and they had also placed there gold and things of
            a marvellous character, and trees and plants, for the place had been made into a garden,
            and they had also dug a well there. Now because <placeName>Macarius</placeName> did not
            know the way, he observed the course of the stars, and travelled thereby; and thus he
            journeyed through the open desert as upon the sea. And he took with him also a bundle of
            thin reeds, and at the end of each mile he used to drive a reed into the ground like a
            rock, so that he might be able to find the way when he had to come back. And when he had
            journeyed for nine days, and had drawn nigh the place wherein was the tomb, the Evil
            One, who always wageth war against the athletes of the Lord, gathered together all the
            reeds which the blessed man <placeName>Macarius</placeName> had driven into the ground,
            and put them under his head for a pillow whilst he was asleep, when he was about one
            mile from the garden, and when the blessed man woke up he found the reeds. Now it is
            probable that God permitted this thing to happen for His own glory and for the triumph
            of His servant, so that <placeName>Macarius</placeName> might not put his confidence in
            reeds, but upon God, Who by means of a pillar of cloud led the children of Israel in the
            desert for forty years. And <placeName>Macarius</placeName> told us, saying,
               <quote>Seventy devils came forth against me from that garden, and they flew about
               before my face like ravens, and they were crying out and groaning, and saying,
                  <quote>What seekest thou here, O <placeName>Macarius</placeName>? What seekest
                  thou, O monk? Why hast thou come hither? Thou canst not stay here.</quote> And I
               said unto them, <quote>I only want to go in and see [the garden], and then I will
                  depart.</quote> And I entered therein, and I saw everything, and [I found] hanging
               over the well an iron chain with a brass bucket, but they were rusted through age;
               and the pomegranates which were therein were dried up and burnt by the sun.</quote>
            And <pb n="175"/>having seen [the garden] he turned and came back in twenty days.</p>
         <p>Now when he was coming back he lacked water, and the bread also which he had carried was
            finished, and he was nigh to perish, and was in great tribulation through thirst, when
            suddenly he saw a damsel who was arrayed in a spotless linen garment and who carried a
            pitcher of water wherefrom water dripped, and she was distant about half a mile from
            him. Then he followed her for three days, thinking that he would overtake her and drink,
            but he did not do so, although she seemed to him to be standing still in one place and
            bearing a pitcher. Then he despaired of obtaining water to drink, and he was brought
            very low, when suddenly there appeared unto him there a herd of buffaloes. And among
            them there was one which had with her a little sucking calf, and she stood still before
            him; and he drew nigh and sucked milk from her. And she came with him through all the
            desert even unto his cell and gave him milk to drink, and she would not let her calf
            suck from her in those days.</p>
         <p>And on another occasion the brethren were digging a well in a certain place which was
            called <placeName>Thrônôn</placeName>, when a serpent which belonged to the class of
            deadly serpents bit him. Then <placeName>Macarius</placeName> took hold of the serpent
            with his two hands by his upper and lower lip and, grasping him tightly, tore him in
            twain, from his head even unto his tail, and said unto him, <quote>Since
                  <persName>Christ</persName> did not send thee, why didst thou dare to come
               [here]?</quote> Now the blessed man had four cells in the desert: one in
               <placeName>Scete</placeName>, in the inner desert, one in
               <placeName>Libya</placeName> (?), one in the <quote>Cells,</quote> and one in
               <placeName>Mount Nitria</placeName>. [Two] of these were without windows, and in them
            he used to dwell in darkness during the Forty <pb n="176"/>Days’ Fast, another was so
            narrow that he could not stretch out his legs, but another, wherein he used to receive
            the brethren who came unto him, was wide and spacious. And he healed so many people who
            were possessed by devils that no man could count them. Once when I and the blessed
               <persName>Evagrius</persName> were there in his cell they brought unto him from
               <placeName>Thessalonica</placeName> a certain virgin who had been a paralytic for
            many years, but by means of prayers and by anointing her with oil with his hands he
            cured her in twenty days and sent her away whole to her city and home; and when she had
            departed she sent to him gold and goods of various kinds.</p>
         <p>And again, he heard from a certain man that the monks of the Monastery of
               <placeName>Tabenna</placeName> lived stern lives of self-denial, and he took counsel
            with himself, and put on the garb of a young man and a husbandman, and in fifteen days
            he went up to the Monastery of the Broken Ones by the way of the desert, and came to the
            Monastery of <placeName>Tabenna</placeName>, seeking to see the head of that Monastery
            whose name was <persName>Pachomius</persName>. Now <persName>Pachomius</persName> was a
            man elect and perfect, and he had the gift of prophecy, but the [business] of the
            blessed <placeName>Macarius</placeName> was hidden from him. And when
               <placeName>Macarius</placeName> saw him he said unto him, <quote>Abbâ, I beseech thee
               to receive me into thy monastery that I may be a monk therein.</quote>
            <persName>Pachomius</persName> said unto him, <quote>Thou art an old man, and art not
               able to fast. The brethren are men who fast, and thou canst not endure their labours,
               and because thou art not able to do this [thou wilt] be offended, and thou wilt go
               forth and wilt abuse them</quote>; and he would receive him neither the first day nor
            the second day, nor any day until seven days [were passed]. But since he remained
            fasting <pb n="177"/>throughout all these days he said unto the head of the monastery,
               <quote>Abbâ, receive me. And if I do not fast like unto you, and toil as ye do,
               command them to cast me out;</quote> so the head of the monastery persuaded the
            brethren to receive him. Now the number of the members of the brotherhood of that
            monastery were four hundred men, [and they are thus even] unto this day; and they
            brought in <placeName>Macarius</placeName>.</p>
         <p>And when a few days had passed, the Forty Days’ Fast drew nigh, and
               <placeName>Macarius</placeName> saw that large numbers of the brethren kept the fast
            and observed the rule of the house in various ways. There were some who ate daily at
            eventide, and some [who fasted for some] nights, and there were also some who ate once
            in five days; and some stood up the whole night through, and sat down in the daytime.
            And the blessed man <placeName>Macarius</placeName> took a large quantity of leaves of
            date palms, and brought them [to his cell], and he stood up in one corner thereof, and
            he neither touched bread nor water, nor bent the knee, nor lay down, until the forty
            days had passed, and the days of unleavened bread had come; but each Sunday he used to
            eat a few moist cabbage leaves so that he might pretend to be taking food. Whensoever he
            went outside his cell for a needful purpose he returned straightway and stood up in his
            place without speaking a word unto any man; and he stood in his place and held his
            peace, and he used to do nothing else except pray within himself, and as he stood up he
            wove rope of the palm leaves. And when all the brethren saw him they made a tumult
            against the head of their monastery, and said unto him, <quote>Whence hast thou brought
               upon us this man, who hath no body and who is incapable of being tired out, to judge
               us and to take vengeance upon us? [Either send him away and let him depart], or know
               that we all will go away.</quote> Now when the head of the monastery had heard from
            the brethren concerning the fasting of <placeName>Macarius</placeName> and his rule of
            life, <pb n="178"/>he prayed to God and entreated Him to reveal to him who this man was,
            and it was revealed unto him by God. Then he went and took him by his hand, and he
            brought him to the house of prayer to the place where the altar was stablished, and he
            answered and said unto him, <quote>Come, O blessed old man, thou art
                  <placeName>Macarius</placeName>, and thou hast hidden thyself from me. For many
               years past I have earnestly desired to see thee, and now I thank thee that thou hast
               broken the heart of the brethren somewhat, so that they may not imagine any longer
               that they observe their fast with excessive rigour. Go then in peace to thy place,
               for in no slight measure hast thou edified us, and do thou continue to pray for
               us</quote>; then <persName>Pachomius</persName> having persuaded him,
               <placeName>Macarius</placeName> departed from thence.</p>
         <p>And <placeName>Macarius</placeName> used to say, <quote>Every kind and variety of rule
               of the life of self-denial and fasting which I have desired to observe with all my
               heart have I kept, but there came upon me the desire that my mind should be with God
               in heaven [if] only for five days, and that I should be exalted above the anxious
               cares and thoughts of material things. And having meditated upon this thing, I shut
               the door of the courtyard and of the cell, and I constrained myself so that I might
               not give a word to [any] man. And I continued thus, and I began [to fulfil this
               thought] on the second day of the week, and I commanded my mind, and said unto it,
                  <quote>Thou shalt not descend from heaven, for behold, there thou hast angels, and
                  the princes of angels, and all the hosts which are in heaven, and especially the
                  Good and Gracious God, the Lord of all. Thou shalt not come down from
                  heaven.</quote> And continuing thus I was sufficient for this thing for two days
               and two nights, and I constrained the Evil One to such a degree that he became a
               flame of fire and burnt up everything which I had in my cell, and at length the very
               mat upon which I stood blazed with fire, and I thought that I should be wholly
               consumed. Now when, finally, fear of the fire took hold upon me my mind came down
               from heaven on the third day, because I was unable to keep my mind collected in the
               state in which it had been, and I came down to the contemplation of the world and the
               things thereof. And this happened so that I might not boast.</quote></p>
         <p>And on another occasion I went to his cell, and I found a priest lying there by the side
            of the door; his whole head was <pb n="179"/>consumed, and was eaten into holes by the
            disease which is called cancer, and the bone of his skull was shewing through. Now this
            man had come unto him to be healed, but <placeName>Macarius</placeName> did not wish to
            see him. And I myself besought the blessed man and said unto him, <quote>I beseech thee
               to have mercy upon him, and to give unto him a word.</quote> Then he answered and
            said unto me, <quote>He is not worthy to be healed, for [this] punishment was sent upon
               him from God. But if thou desirest that he shall be healed persuade him to forsake
               the ministration at the altar, for he used both to be minister at the altar and to
               commit fornication, and for this reason he was punished. Persuade him then to forsake
               [his ministrations], and God will heal him.</quote> And having said these things to
            the sick man he pledged himself and swore an oath, saying, <quote>I will never minister
               at the altar again</quote>; and afterwards <placeName>Macarius</placeName> received
            him, and said unto him, <quote>Dost thou believe that God existeth?</quote> and the
            priest said unto him, <quote>Yea, master.</quote> And again
               <placeName>Macarius</placeName> said unto him, <quote>Peradventure thou art able to
               scoff [at God],</quote> and the priest said unto him, <quote>Nay.</quote> Then the
            blessed man said unto him, <quote>If now thou dost acknowledge thy folly, and also that
               thy punishment was from God and that it was a fitting punishment for thy deeds, first
               of all confess thy transgressions.</quote> And the priest gave a promise that he
            would not sin <pb n="181"/>again, and that he would not minister at the altar, but that
            he would lead a life which was suited to the capacity and grade of those who were in the
            world; and <placeName>Macarius</placeName> laid his hand upon him, and in a few days he
            was made whole, and the hair grew upon his head [again], and he went to his house healed
            whilst I was looking at him.</p>
         <p>And again a certain young man who had an evil devil was brought unto him and he laid one
            hand on the head of the young man and another on his heart, and he prayed until he made
            the devil to rise up in the air, whereupon the young man breathed out his breath and
            became like a great [empty] skin bottle; and he suddenly uttered a cry, and water flowed
            out from all parts of his members, and he was made whole and became as he was before the
            devil entered into him. Then <persName>Macarius</persName> anointed him with the oil of the martyrs, and
            commanded his father that he was not to taste flesh or wine for forty days, until he was
            thoroughly healed.</p>
         <p>And again on a certain occasion certain thoughts of vainglory vexed him, and urged him
            to go forth from his cell and to depart and heal the multitudes in Rome and to give
            assistance unto those who were lying [there] sick, for the grace and might of God were
            inciting him greatly to heal those who were possessed of devils and to make whole those
            who were diseased; but although he was much disturbed in his mind [on this matter], yet
            he was not persuaded to go, for the Evil One greatly pressed upon him in his thoughts.
            Finally, however, he lay down inside the door of his cell, and having set his legs (or
            feet) on the threshold, he cried out and said, <quote>Pull, unclean devils, pull hard,
               for I will never go [thither] on my legs, and if you are able to carry me you must do
               so thus.</quote> And he took an oath to them [i.e., the brethren], saying, <quote>I
               continued to lie thus until the evening, and if ye had not lifted me up, I should
               never have moved from my place.</quote> And when the night had come he stood up.</p>
         <p>And again, on another occasion, when these thoughts were mounting up [in his mind] he
            filled with sand a basket which held two or three bushels, and lifting it on his
            shoulders he began to wander about [with it] in the desert. And his kinsman Theosebius
            the Antiochian met him and he said unto him, <quote>What art thou carrying on thy
               shoulders, father? Tell me, so that I may carry thy load, and that thou mayest not
               toil thyself.</quote> And he said unto him, <quote>I am making to work that which
               hath made me to work, for it wisheth to go forth from its state of rest, and it
               fatigueth me</quote>; and having walked about for a long time he went into his cell,
            having exhausted his body.</p>
         <p>And one day there laid hold upon me the chills of fever, and I went and sat down, and
            watched him from the window (or opening in the wall), in the feebleness of his old age.
            And I was thinking about him that he was like unto one of the brethren of old, and I
            began to listen unto him that I might see what he was saying, or what he was doing; now
            he was alone inside [his cell], and he was one hundred years old, and moreover, his
            teeth had fallen out by reason of his old age. And I listened unto him and to what he
            was saying, and he was striving with his soul and with <persName>Satan</persName>, and he was saying unto
            himself, <quote>What dost thou wish for, O thou wicked old man? Behold, thou hast eaten
               oil, and thou hast drunk wine, what more dost thou wish for? Wouldst [thou] eat
               <persName>Satan</persName>’s white food?</quote> And he was reviling himself. And moreover he said unto
            <persName>Satan</persName>, <quote>I cannot conquer thee in any wise, and thou art not able to do anything
               unto me; get thee gone from me.</quote> And again he said unto himself, <quote>How
               long shall I be with thee?</quote></p>
         <p>And moreover, <persName>Paphnutius</persName>, the disciple of this man, related unto myself and unto the
            blessed <persName>Evagrius</persName>, saying, <quote>One day a female hyena took her whelp, which was blind,
               and came and knocked with her head at the door of the court when he was sitting
               therein, and she dropped the whelp at his feet. And he took up the whelp, and prayed,
               and spat in its eyes, and straightway its eyes were opened and it saw; and its mother
               gave it suck, and then took it up and went forth. And one day later she brought unto
               the blessed man a sheep-skin cloak, that is to say, a skin which hath been stripped
               off a sheep; and the blessed woman <persName>Melania</persName> spoke unto me concerning this sheep-skin
               cloak, saying, <quote>I myself received this sheep-skin cloak from the hands of
                  <persName>Macarius</persName> as a blessing.</quote></quote></p>
         <p>And <persName>Paphnutius</persName> also spake thus, <quote>From the first day whereon he received baptism he
               never spat upon the ground, and he lived for sixty years after his
            baptism.</quote></p>
         <p>Now in his latter days he was beardless, and he only had a small quantity of hair upon
            his [upper] lip and upon his chin; because by reason of his excessive fasting and the
            abstinence of his solitary life not even the hair of [his] beard would grow. I once went
            unto him when weariness of the ascetic life had laid hold upon me, and I said unto him,
               <quote>Father, what shall I do? For my thoughts vex me, and say unto me, <quote>Thou
                  art doing no [good], get thee gone from here.</quote></quote> And he said unto me,
               <quote>Say unto thy thoughts, <quote>For Christ’s sake I will guard these
                  walls.</quote></quote></p>
         <p>I have written for thee these few things out of a very large number concerning the life
            and deeds of the holy man <persName>Macarius</persName>, and concerning the solitary monks who were his
            companions; and everything is indeed true. I entreat all those brethren who read in this
            book, or who desire to take a copy therefrom, not to forget [to write] after [this
            section] the narrative which is found in certain of the codices at the end of the above
            history which relateth unto the matters of <persName>Macarius</persName>, as if these histories had been
            composed by <persName>Hieronymus</persName>, but they must know that of a certainty that they were composed
            by <persName>Palladius</persName>. For I have found the absolute ending of this book which belonged to the
            histories of the matters of <persName>Macarius</persName>, with an apology and a preface which were composed
            by <persName>Palladius</persName> [and addressed] to Lausus the Prefect, wherein he maketh known concerning
            all the various kinds of the divers histories of men and of women which were composed by
            him; and I will prepare this apology and preface, and by the help of God I will write
            them down in the proper place.</p>
