         <head>The History of Macarius the Alexandrian, the Glorious</head>
         <p>As for the other Macarius, the Alexandrian, I did see him, for he was an elder in the
            place which is called the <quote>Cells,</quote> wherein I myself lived for nine years, and he lived
            for three years after I entered therein; some of [his] wonderful acts I myself have
            seen, and some of them I have learned from others, and [of others] I have also heard
            rumours. Now his sad, stern life of self-denial was as follows: Whensoever he heard of
            any beautiful deed being done by any man whatsoever, he must straightway carry it into
            practice in a fuller form. He once heard from a certain man that all the brethren of
            Tabenna never tasted any food whatsoever which had been cooked by fire during the whole
            of the Forty Days’ Fast, and he straightway determined within himself that for seven
            years he would not eat any food which had been cooked by fire, and that he would not
            partake of anything except young wild herbs, and vegetables which had been made soft by
            soaking in water, or similar things. And when he had completed this rule of life he
            heard of a monk in a certain monastery who only ate one pound of bread each day, and he
            straightway broke his bread into pieces and cast it into a vessel with a narrow mouth,
            and he determined within himself that he would eat nothing that his hand could not draw
            up out of the vessel the first time [he put it in]. And time after time, he used to tell
            the story with a smile, and say, <quote>When I put my hand down I could fill it readily, but I
            could not draw it up full because the mouth of the vessel was [too] narrow, and it would
            not let me take it out full.</quote> Now he lived this hard life for three years, and ate
            [daily only] four or five ounces of bread; and of water also he only drank sufficient to
            enable him to eat his bread. Of oil [he took] only one flask each year, making use of it
            only on the great First Day of the Resurrection, and on the great day of Pentecost, and
            at the Nativity, and at the Epiphany, and when he received [the Mysteries] during the
            Forty Days’ Fast. I will tell also of the various other practices of his sad, hard life.
            He determined [once] to vanquish sleep, and it is related that he never entered under a
            roof for twenty days, and that he was burnt up by the exceedingly great heat of the sun
            at noonday during all this time, and that during the nights he was without rest. And he
            himself told us, <quote>Had I not quickly gone in under a roof and slept, and rested myself
            the brains in my head would have dried up, and I should become like a drunk man. But,</quote>
            he would say, <quote>I have been conquered against my will, for although the nature of the
            body hath been overcome I have given it what it needeth.</quote></p>
         <p>And again, once when he was sitting in his cell a gnat bit him in the leg and he
            suffered pain, and he crushed the gnat in his hand and killed it. Then straightway he
            despised himself because he had avenged himself upon the gnat, and he passed upon
            himself the sentence that he should go to the place which is called <quote>Scete,</quote> that is to
            say, the inner desert, and sit there naked for six months. For there were many great
            gnats (i.e., mosquitoes) there, and they were so savage that they could pierce the skins
            of pigs, and they resembled wasps; and his whole body was so eaten and swollen that a
            man would have thought that he had the hide of an elephant, and when he came [back] to
            his cell six months later they could only recognize from his voice that he was
            Macarius.</p>
         <p>And again he desired greatly to go and see the garden of Jannes and Jambres, the
            magicians of Egypt, because, as he himself told us, they had obtained power, and riches
            and dominion, and had built there a tomb, and had established there great works in
            marble; now their tomb was ornamented with many things, and they had also placed there
            gold and things of a marvellous character, and trees and plants, for the place had been
            made into a garden, and they had also dug a well there. Now because Macarius did not
            know the way, he observed the course of the stars, and travelled thereby; and thus he
            journeyed through the open desert as upon the sea. And he took with him also a bundle of
            thin reeds, and at the end of each mile he used to drive a reed into the ground like a
            rock, so that he might be able to find the way when he had to come back. And when he had
            journeyed for nine days, and had drawn nigh the place wherein was the tomb, the Evil
            One, who always wageth war against the athletes of the Lord, gathered together all the
            reeds which the blessed man Macarius had driven into the ground, and put them under his
            head for a pillow whilst he was asleep, when he was about one mile from the garden, and
            when the blessed man woke up he found the reeds. Now it is probable that God permitted
            this thing to happen for His own glory and for the triumph of His servant, so that
            Macarius might not put his confidence in reeds, but upon God, Who by means of a pillar
            of cloud led the children of Israel in the desert for forty years. And Macarius told us,
            saying, <quote>Seventy devils came forth against me from that garden, and they flew about
            before my face like ravens, and they were crying out and groaning, and saying, <quote>What
            seekest thou here, O Macarius? What seekest thou, O monk? Why hast thou come hither?
            Thou canst not stay here.</quote> And I said unto them, <quote>I only want to go in and see [the
            garden], and then I will depart.</quote> And I entered therein, and I saw everything, and [I
            found] hanging over the well an iron chain with a brass bucket, but they were rusted
            through age; and the pomegranates which were therein were dried up and burnt by the
            sun.</quote> And having seen [the garden] he turned and came back in twenty days.</p>
         <p>Now when he was coming back he lacked water, and the bread also which he had carried was
            finished, and he was nigh to perish, and was in great tribulation through thirst, when
            suddenly he saw a damsel who was arrayed in a spotless linen garment and who carried a
            pitcher of water wherefrom water dripped, and she was distant about half a mile from
            him. Then he followed her for three days, thinking that he would overtake her and drink,
            but he did not do so, although she seemed to him to be standing still in one place and
            bearing a pitcher. Then he despaired of obtaining water to drink, and he was brought
            very low, when suddenly there appeared unto him there a herd of buffaloes. And among
            them there was one which had with her a little sucking calf, and she stood still before
            him; and he drew nigh and sucked milk from her. And she came with him through all the
            desert even unto his cell and gave him milk to drink, and she would not let her calf
            suck from her in those days.</p>
         <p>And on another occasion the brethren were digging a well in a certain place which was
            called Thrônôn, when a serpent which belonged to the class of deadly serpents bit him.
            Then Macarius took hold of the serpent with his two hands by his upper and lower lip
            and, grasping him tightly, tore him in twain, from his head even unto his tail, and said
            unto him, <quote>Since Christ did not send thee, why didst thou dare to come [here]?</quote> Now the
            blessed man had four cells in the desert: one in Scete, in the inner desert, one in
            Libya (?), one in the <quote>Cells,</quote> and one in Mount Nitria. [Two] of these were without
            windows, and in them he used to dwell in darkness during the Forty Days’ Fast, another
            was so narrow that he could not stretch out his legs, but another, wherein he used to
            receive the brethren who came unto him, was wide and spacious. And he healed so many
            people who were possessed by devils that no man could count them. Once when I and the
            blessed Evagrius were there in his cell they brought unto him from Thessalonica a
            certain virgin who had been a paralytic for many years, but by means of prayers and by
            anointing her with oil with his hands he cured her in twenty days and sent her away
            whole to her city and home; and when she had departed she sent to him gold and goods of
            various kinds.</p>
         <p>And again, he heard from a certain man that the monks of the Monastery of Tabenna lived
            stern lives of self-denial, and he took counsel with himself, and put on the garb of a
            young man and a husbandman, and in fifteen days he went up to the Monastery of the
            Broken Ones by the way of the desert, and came to the Monastery of Tabenna, seeking to
            see the head of that Monastery whose name was Pachomius. Now Pachomius was a man elect
            and perfect, and he had the gift of prophecy, but the [business] of the blessed Macarius
            was hidden from him. And when Macarius saw him he said unto him, <quote>Abbâ, I beseech thee
            to receive me into thy monastery that I may be a monk therein.</quote> Pachomius said unto him,
            <quote>Thou art an old man, and art not able to fast. The brethren are men who fast, and thou
            canst not endure their labours, and because thou art not able to do this [thou wilt] be
            offended, and thou wilt go forth and wilt abuse them</quote>; and he would receive him neither
            the first day nor the second day, nor any day until seven days [were passed]. But since
            he remained fasting throughout all these days he said unto the head of the monastery,
            <quote>Abbâ, receive me. And if I do not fast like unto you, and toil as ye do, command them
            to cast me out;</quote> so the head of the monastery persuaded the brethren to receive him. Now
            the number of the members of the brotherhood of that monastery were four hundred men,
            [and they are thus even] unto this day; and they brought in Macarius.</p>
         <p>And when a few days had passed, the Forty Days’ Fast drew nigh, and Macarius saw that
            large numbers of the brethren kept the fast and observed the rule of the house in
            various ways. There were some who ate daily at eventide, and some [who fasted for some]
            nights, and there were also some who ate once in five days; and some stood up the whole
            night through, and sat down in the daytime. And the blessed man Macarius took a large
            quantity of leaves of date palms, and brought them [to his cell], and he stood up in one
            corner thereof, and he neither touched bread nor water, nor bent the knee, nor lay down,
            until the forty days had passed, and the days of unleavened bread had come; but each
            Sunday he used to eat a few moist cabbage leaves so that he might pretend to be taking
            food. Whensoever he went outside his cell for a needful purpose he returned straightway
            and stood up in his place without speaking a word unto any man; and he stood in his
            place and held his peace, and he used to do nothing else except pray within himself, and
            as he stood up he wove rope of the palm leaves. And when all the brethren saw him they
            made a tumult against the head of their monastery, and said unto him, <quote>Whence hast thou
            brought upon us this man, who hath no body and who is incapable of being tired out, to
            judge us and to take vengeance upon us? [Either send him away and let him depart], or
            know that we all will go away.</quote> Now when the head of the monastery had heard from the
            brethren concerning the fasting of Macarius and his rule of life, he prayed to God and
            entreated Him to reveal to him who this man was, and it was revealed unto him by God.
            Then he went and took him by his hand, and he brought him to the house of prayer to the
            place where the altar was stablished, and he answered and said unto him, <quote>Come, O
            blessed old man, thou art Macarius, and thou hast hidden thyself from me. For many years
            past I have earnestly desired to see thee, and now I thank thee that thou hast broken
            the heart of the brethren somewhat, so that they may not imagine any longer that they
            observe their fast with excessive rigour. Go then in peace to thy place, for in no
            slight measure hast thou edified us, and do thou continue to pray for us</quote>; then
            Pachomius having persuaded him, Macarius departed from thence.</p>
         <p>And Macarius used to say, <quote>Every kind and variety of rule of the life of self-denial and
            fasting which I have desired to observe with all my heart have I kept, but there came
            upon me the desire that my mind should be with God in heaven [if] only for five days,
            and that I should be exalted above the anxious cares and thoughts of material things.
            And having meditated upon this thing, I shut the door of the courtyard and of the cell,
            and I constrained myself so that I might not give a word to [any] man. And I continued
            thus, and I began [to fulfil this thought] on the second day of the week, and I
            commanded my mind, and said unto it, <quote>Thou shalt not descend from heaven, for behold,
            there thou hast angels, and the princes of angels, and all the hosts which are in
            heaven, and especially the Good and Gracious God, the Lord of all. Thou shalt not come
            down from heaven.</quote> And continuing thus I was sufficient for this thing for two days and
            two nights, and I constrained the Evil One to such a degree that he became a flame of
            fire and burnt up everything which I had in my cell, and at length the very mat upon
            which I stood blazed with fire, and I thought that I should be wholly consumed. Now
            when, finally, fear of the fire took hold upon me my mind came down from heaven on the
            third day, because I was unable to keep my mind collected in the state in which it had
            been, and I came down to the contemplation of the world and the things thereof. And this
            happened so that I might not boast.</quote></p>
         <p>And on another occasion I went to his cell, and I found a priest lying there by the side
            of the door; his whole head was consumed, and was eaten into holes by the disease which
            is called cancer, and the bone of his skull was shewing through. Now this man had come
            unto him to be healed, but Macarius did not wish to see him. And I myself besought the
            blessed man and said unto him, <quote>I beseech thee to have mercy upon him, and to give unto
            him a word.</quote> Then he answered and said unto me, <quote>He is not worthy to be healed, for
            [this] punishment was sent upon him from God. But if thou desirest that he shall be
            healed persuade him to forsake the ministration at the altar, for he used both to be
            minister at the altar and to commit fornication, and for this reason he was punished.
            Persuade him then to forsake [his ministrations], and God will heal him.</quote> And having
            said these things to the sick man he pledged himself and swore an oath, saying, <quote>I will
            never minister at the altar again</quote>; and afterwards Macarius received him, and said unto
            him, <quote>Dost thou believe that God existeth?</quote> and the priest said unto him, <quote>Yea, master.</quote>
            And again Macarius said unto him, <quote>Peradventure thou art able to scoff [at God],</quote> and
            the priest said unto him, <quote>Nay.</quote> Then the blessed man said unto him, <quote>If now thou dost
            acknowledge thy folly, and also that thy punishment was from God and that it was a
            fitting punishment for thy deeds, first of all confess thy transgressions.</quote> And the
            priest gave a promise that he would not sin again, and that he would not minister at the
            altar, but that he would lead a life which was suited to the capacity and grade of those
            who were in the world; and Macarius laid his hand upon him, and in a few days he was
            made whole, and the hair grew upon his head [again], and he went to his house healed
            whilst I was looking at him.</p>
