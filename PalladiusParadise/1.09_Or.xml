         <head>The History of the Blessed Man <persName>Hor</persName></head>
         <p>Now in Mount <placeName>Nitria</placeName> there was a certain man whose name was Ho, concerning whom men,
            especially all the brotherhood, testify to many of his triumphs, and also that
            marvellous and excellent woman <persName>Melh√¢ (i.e., Melania)</persName>, the handmaid of <persName>Christ</persName>, who went
            into this mountain before I did. As for me, I never became acquainted with this man. And
            in his history they say this one thing: <quote>He never told a lie in his life, and he never
            used oaths; he never uttered a curse, and beyond what was absolutely necessary he never
            spoke at all.</quote></p>
