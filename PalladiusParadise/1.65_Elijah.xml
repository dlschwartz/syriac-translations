         <head>Of the Blessed Man Elijah</head>
         <p>And there was in this place a solitary monk called Elijah who used to dwell in a cave,
            and he passed his life in performing the works of spiritual excellence, and was worthy
            of praise. One day, when a great many of the brethren thronged to him—now his
            [dwelling-place] was a cave—he lacked bread, and he made apologies [to us] because he
            was troubled on account of the insufficiency of the bread. Now therefore, when the
            brethren went into his cell they found three loaves of bread, and when twenty men had
            eaten and were satisfied, there still remained one loaf which, one said, satisfied him
            for five and twenty days.</p>
