         <head>Of <persName>Abraham the Egyptian</persName></head>
         <p>And there was also a certain man whose name was <persName>Abraham</persName>, and he kept a rule of life of
            the sternest hardness in the desert; and he was hurt in his understanding by reason of
            the vain opinion which he held concerning himself. One day he came to the church and
            strove with the elders, saying, <quote>I have been made an elder by <persName>Christ</persName> during the past
            night, and ye must associate me in the ministrations of the priesthood.</quote> And when the
            fathers had come to a decision concerning him, and had brought him out of the desert,
            they laid a light rule of life upon him, and in this manner they cured him of his
            arrogance, and brought him to the state of being sensible of his feebleness, and of
            having knowledge of his infirmity, through which the devils made a mock of him.</p>
