         <head>Of the Blessed Man Kapiton</head>
         <p>Now by the side of this man there used to dwell Kapiton, a man who had been formerly a
            thief, and he had lived in holes in the rocks for fifty years, [at a place] which was
            about four miles from AntinoÃ«; he never went down from his cave, not even to the river
            Nile, for he used to say that he was unable to meet in the congregation of the children
            of men him that still fought with him, namely, his Adversary.</p>
