            <head>Of The Blessed Man Pachomius</head>
            <p>Stephen was a man who was by race of the Libyans who [dwell by] the side of Marmarica
               and Mareotis, and he lived there for sixty years. Now in another codex [the text
               readeth] differently, thus: There was also in the desert a certain blessed man whose
               name was Stephen, and he was by race a Libyan from the border (or side) of Marmarica;
               and he dwelt there in the desert for sixty years. And having attained unto the
               heights of a perfect rule of life, he was esteemed [by Divine Grace] worthy of the
               gift of discerning prudence and of the faculty of giving consolation to such an
               extent that whosoever drew nigh unto him, being afflicted in any way whatsoever,
               departed from him with joy. Now the blessed Anthony was acquainted with this man. And
               this Stephen continued in this life even unto our own days, but I never lived with
               him and I never met him, because the mountain [wherein he dwelt] was a long way off
               from me. The holy men Ammonius and Evagrius, however, who went to visit him related
               unto me stories concerning him, and they said, <quote>Having gone to him we found him
               grievously sick of a certain sore sickness which had come upon him, for a cancerous
               sore had broken out in the lower parts of his body; now this sore is called
               <quote>gangrene,</quote> and we found him being cut by a certain physician. Nevertheless the holy
               man was working with his hands and was plaiting [palm] leaves, and he held converse
               with us whilst portions of his body were being cut off. And he possessed the faculty
               of patient endurance to such a degree that it seemed as if the body of some one else
               was being cut instead of his own; now when his members had been shorn off like hair
               he continued, through the grace of God, to be without perception thereof. And whilst
               the physician was binding him up he sat still and plaited baskets with his hands, and
               he conversed with us, rejoicing and giving thanks unto God. And moreover, he
               displayed such patient endurance whilst his member was being cut off that one might
               have thought that it had not been cut off at all, and he resembled altogether a man
               from whose body threads of hair are being plucked. Now we stood there and marvelled
               at this affliction, for we could not bear to see the man who had led a life of such
               ascetic and spiritual excellences fall into such a state of suffering that at length
               amputation of his members was necessary. And the blessed man, having perceived our
               thoughts and seen that it grieved us, answered and said unto us, <quote>O my sons, be not
               ye afflicted concerning this matter, and do not lessen your faith because of this
               thing, for God never performeth anything whatsoever that is evil, on the contrary, He
               looketh for a happy conclusion [to His work]. Oh, how many were the times when these
               members were condemned to punishment! For they merited being cut off, and it is
               better that they should receive their reward here than after their departure out of
               this world.</quote> These were the things which he spake unto us, and he comforted us and
               sent us away, saying, <quote>Be not ye scandalized when ye see trials of this kind coming
               upon holy men, for by such God hath built us up and comforted us, and hath made us to
               be confirmed in the laws which are against tribulations.</quote> </quote> I have related these
               things in order that we may not wonder when we see the saints falling into
               tribulations.</p>
            <p>And he assured me with an oath, saying, <quote>When I was fifty years old lust placed
               itself [upon] me for twelve years, never going away from me either by day or by
               night, and I thought in my mind that God had forsaken me, and therefore (for to such
               an extent had lust gained dominion over me) I determined in my heart that I would
               either suffer death through dumb beasts, or that I should become a laughing-stock or
               a man condemned through the lust of the body. And I went forth and wandered round
               about in the desert, and I found a den of hyenas, and I laid myself down naked at the
               entrance thereof that they might come out and devour me. And when it was evening—as
               it is written, <quote>He hath made the darkness, and it becometh night, wherein all the
               beasts of the forest do move (Psalm 104:20), and the lions roar to break [their
               prey]</quote>—the hyenas, both male and female, came out, and they all sniffed at (or smelt)
               me, and licked my body from my head to my feet, and while I was thinking that they
               would eat me they went away from me; and there I remained the whole of that night,
               and they ate me not. And again I thought that God had had compassion upon me, and
               straightway I returned and came to my cell. And that devil of lust, having forborne
               with me a little, returned once again, and moreover he attacked me more fiercely than
               before, and he did so with such vigour that by reason of my affliction I well nigh
               cursed myself. Now, this devil of lust used to take the form of an Ethiopian damsel
               whom I saw in my early manhood gathering canes in the summer, and he came in her form
               and sat upon my knees, and he used to set me on fire with lust to such an extent that
               I imagined I was having intercourse with her, and when through the burning of my
               heart and the madness thereof, I gave her the cheek, straightway she would lift
               herself up from me and take to flight. And from the time when I touched her my hand
               was so polluted that for the space of two hours [afterwards] whensoever I brought my
               hand near me I was unable [to free it] from her foulness. But again I went forth
               because of my affliction, and I began to wander about in the desert, and I found a
               small asp, and I took it and placed its head upon the members of my body, and I
               squeezed the head of the asp so that it might bite me and I might die, and so find
               relief, but it bit me not. And after this I heard a voice which came to my ears and
               said unto me, <quote>Depart, Pachomius, and be strong; I have allowed thee to be overcome
               in order that thou mightest not imagine that thou wast a mighty man and a man of
               perfection, and that thou hadst triumphed through thine own life and deeds, but that
               thou mightest know thine infirmity, and the feebleness of thy nature, and that thou
               mightest not rely upon thine asceticism but mightest confess the help of God and cry
               out to Him always.</quote> And having heard these words I returned to my cell, and I dwelt
               therein with great boldness of heart, and I never again had anxious care concerning
               this warfare of lust, but I continued in peace for the rest of my days after this
               warfare. Now, the devil of lust, seeing that I no longer meditated about the matter,
               never again approached me.</quote> With these words about the striving against Satan the
               holy man Pachomius confirmed me, and he made me strong to play the man more and more,
               and to be mighty in the warfare against the devil of fornication, and he dismissed me
               and said unto me, <quote>Be strong and mighty in our Lord.</quote></p>

            <head>A Preface concerning those who have fallen into the Errors of Sins</head>
            <p>It is very necessary, O my brethren, that we should also keep in memory the histories
               which concern the life and deeds of those who have tripped up and fallen as an
               excellent admonition of those who come across this book (just as among the trees that
               were in Paradise the Tree of Good and Evil was also found), so that if it happen that
               certain men lead good lives through the Grace and help of God, Who is wont to help
               those whose motive of soul is [directed] straight to the mark, they may not be
               exalted overmuch and have pride in their works of ascetic excellence. For on many
               occasions this very excellence itself hath been the cause of a fall when it hath not
               been made perfect by means of a correct motive, for it is written, <quote>I have seen the
               righteous man who hath perished in his righteousness, which also is vanity</quote>
               (Ecclesiasticus 7:15).</p>
