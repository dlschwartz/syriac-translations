         <head>Chapter 16: Of how Abba <persName>Pachomius</persName> would not keep Beautiful Buildings</head>
         <p>The blessed man <persName>Pachomius</persName> built an oratory in his monastery, and he made pillars [for
            it], and covered the faces thereof with tiles, and he furnished it beautifully, and he
            was exceedingly pleased with the work because he had built it well; and when he had come
            to himself he declared, through the agency of <persName>Satan</persName>, that the beauty of the oratory was
            a thing which would compel a man to admire it, and that the building thereof would be
            praised. Then suddenly he rose up, and took ropes, and fastened them round the pillars,
            and he made a prayer within himself, and commanded the brethren to help him, and they
            bowed their bodies, and the pillars and the whole construction fell [to the ground]; and
            he said to the brethren, <quote>Take heed lest ye strive to ornament the work of your hands
            overmuch, and take ye the greatest possible care that the grace of God and His gift may
            be in the work of each one of you, so that the mind may not stumble towards the praises
            of cunning wickedness, and the <persName>Calumniator</persName> may not obtain [his] prey.</quote></p>
