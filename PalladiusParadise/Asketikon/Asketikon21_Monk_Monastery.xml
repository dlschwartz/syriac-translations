         <head>Chapter 21: Of a certain Monk who belonged to the Monastery</head>
         <p>Now before we bring this history to a close we are obliged to mention, in addition to
            those of whom we have already spoken, another holy monk who was thoroughly trained in
            the spiritual excellence of the brethren, so that we may narrate a few of the things
            which were wrought by him for edification. This brother, of blessed memory, because he
            was afflicted in his body had a cell separate from the brethren; he lived upon bread and
            salt only, and he used to make one mat of plaited palm leaves each day, and it would
            happen often, when he was plaiting the ropes which were being used in making the mats,
            that his hands would become covered with blood, and they were so full of wounds caused
            by the reeds, that the very mats which he was making were wetted with blood. But
            although he suffered from such a weakness as this, he never turned away from the
            congregation of the brethren, and he never lay down to sleep in the daytime until the
            end of his life. And it was his habit every night before he lay down to sleep to repeat
            some portion of the Scriptures, and then he would go to sleep until they beat the board
            to summon the congregation to the service of the night.</p>
         <p>Now on one occasion a certain brother went to him, and seeing that his hands were
            covered with blood through plaiting mats, he said unto him, <quote>Why dost thou work and toil
            in this manner, seeing that thou art so seriously ill? Thinkest thou that thou wouldst
            not obtain permission not to work and to be idle from God? God knoweth that thou art
            sick, and no man who hath thy complaint hath ever worked. We feed and take care of
            strangers and poor folk, and are we not in duty bound to minister unto thy wants, thou
            who art one of us, and art so holy a man, with all our soul and with the greatest joy
            and gladness?</quote> And the monk said unto him, <quote>It is impossible for me not to work,</quote> and
            the brother replied, <quote>If it pleaseth thee to act thus, at least anoint thy hands with
            oil at eventide, for thou wilt not become as weary as thou art now, and thou wilt not
            become covered with blood.</quote> And the monk hearkened unto that brother, and anointed his
            hands with oil, even as he had told him to do, yet because they were tender they were
            grievously chafed, and cut, and torn by the sharp reeds (or palm-grass). Then Rabbâ
            himself went to visit him in his cell, and he said unto him, <quote>Thinkest thou, O Theodore,
            that the oil had any beneficial effect upon thee? Who forced thee to work? Didst thou
            not place thy hope of being healed rather upon the operation of the oil than upon God?
            Peradventure was not thy God able to heal thee? Yet when He saw that thou wast ordering
            help for thyself He left thee [to fall into] this pain.</quote> Then the monk answered and said
            unto Rabbâ, <quote>O father, I have sinned against God, and I give thanks (or confess), and I
            entreat thee that God may forgive me this sin.</quote></p>
         <p>And, according to what those fathers who were with him said, he passed a full year in
            mourning for this act of folly; and he ate once every two days. And at the beginning of
            the period wherein this man began to gain strength considerably, Rabbâ was in the habit
            of sending him to every monastery that he might be both the foundation and the type of
            all the brethren, because he endured the cruel weakness of that disease with such
            patience.</p>
         <p>Here endeth the History of the Followers of Pachomius, which is called in Greek the
            Asketikon of the Followers of Pachomius</p>
