         <p>And we also saw another brother among the monks whose name was <persName>Chronius</persName>, and he had
            arrived at a good old age, and was one of the first men who were contemporaneous with
            Abb√¢ <persName>Anthony</persName>; he was about one hundred and ten years of age, and he comforted us greatly
            and admonished us by his humility, which he had preserved even in his old age.</p>
         <p>Here endeth the Triumph of <persName>Chronius</persName></p>
