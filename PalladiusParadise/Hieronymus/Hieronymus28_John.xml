         <head>Chapter 28: The Triumph of <persName>John</persName></head>
         <p>And we saw another blessed man whose name was <persName>John</persName>, and he was an Abbâ of the monks in
            the city of <placeName>Dîkâpôlîs</placeName>; and grace clung to him even as unto <persName>Abraham</persName>, and his beard flowed
            down like that of <persName>Aaron</persName>. He worked <pb n="379"/>many mighty deeds and cures, and he healed those who
            were afflicted with gout, and the sick, and those who were paralytics.</p>
         <p>Here endeth the Triumph of <persName>John</persName></p>
