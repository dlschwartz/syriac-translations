         <head>Chapter 26: The Triumph of <persName>Three Brethren</persName></head>
         <p>And we saw there also <persName>three brethren</persName> who were learned in speech and glorious in their
            lives and deeds, and because of their splendid works they were about to be raised to the
            grade of the episcopate. They had cut off their ears in the fear of God, but although
            they had done this with great boldness (or presumption), the object with which they had
            done it was a good one, for [they wished] that henceforth no man might vex them.</p>
         <p>Here end the Triumphs of <persName>Three Brethren</persName></p>
