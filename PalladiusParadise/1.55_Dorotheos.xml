         <head>Of <persName>Dorotheos</persName> the Priest</head>
         <p>And there was <persName>Dorotheos</persName>, a priest, who used to live in a cave, and he possessed more
            goodness than many men, and led a spiritual life of high excellence; now he had been
            held to be worthy of consecration to the priesthood, and he performed the offices
            thereof for the brethren who dwelt in the caves. Unto this blessed man <persName>Melania</persName> the Less,
            the kinswoman of <persName>Melania</persName> the Great, concerning whom we are about to speak later, sent
            five hundred darics and begged him to spend them on behalf of the brethren [who were
            there]; but he only took three of them, and then sent the remainder to the wandering
            monk <persName>Diocles</persName>, a man of knowledge and understanding, saying, <quote>O our brother <persName>Diocles</persName>, thou
            art wiser than I am; I am not equal [to spending these]</quote>; and having taken them <persName>Diocles</persName>
            was able to spend them wisely on those whom he knew of a certainty to be in want.</p>
