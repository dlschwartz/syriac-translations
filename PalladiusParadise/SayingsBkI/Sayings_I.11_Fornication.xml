         <head>Chapter 11: Of Fornication</head>
         <div type="saying" n="559">
            <p>A certain monk was engaged, on one occasion, in a war against fornication, and he had
               in his heart, as it were, a burning fire by day and by night; but he bore this agony,
               and did not bring low his mind, and after a long time the war passed away from him,
               but he was unable to vanquish it in any way except by patient endurance, and
               straightway light rose on his mind.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="560">
            <p>And another brother also was engaged in a war against fornication, and he rose up by
               night, and came to one of the old men and told him his mind, and the old man
               persuaded him [to endure], and he was helped, and went [back] to his cell. And again
               he came unto the old man, and again he helped him, and the brother went [back] to his
               cell; and the war came upon him the third time, and again he went back by night to
               the old man, and the old man did not cause him pain but spake with him for his
               benefit, and said unto him, <quote>Give it no opportunity, but come hither whensoever the
               devil vexeth thee, and thou wilt expose him, and when he hath been exposed he will
               take to flight. For nothing vexeth the devil of fornication so much as that a man
               should hide his thoughts and not reveal them.</quote> Now that brother came to the old man
               eleven times and made accusations against his thoughts, for he wished to be helped;
               and when the old man spake unto him that devil took to flight, but when he came
               [back] to his cell the war came upon him. At length the brother said unto the old
               man, <quote>Do an act of grace, father, and tell me a word [whereby I may live].</quote> The old
               man said unto him, <quote>Be of good courage, my son, and if God permitteth my thought it
               shall come to thee, and thou shalt bear it no longer, but thou shalt depart being
               innocent.</quote> He said this, and God did away the war of that brother.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="561">
            <p>And another brother was engaged in a war against fornication, and he bore it with
               very great self-restraint for fourteen years, and he guarded his mind against being
               subservient to lust, and at length he came to the church, and made known the matter
               unto all the people; and when they heard [it] they were pained, and they prayed for a
               whole week to God on his behalf, and afterwards He did away the war that was in
               him.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="562">
            <p>On one occasion Abbâ Moses of Pâtârâ was engaged in a war against fornication, and he
               could not endure being in his cell, and he went and informed Abbâ Isidore of it; and
               the old man entreated him to return to his cell, but he would not agree [to this].
               And having said, <quote>Father, I cannot bear it,</quote> the old man took him up to the roof of
               his cell, and said unto him, <quote>Look to the west,</quote> and when he looked he saw multitudes
               of devils with troubled and terrified aspects, and they shewed themselves in the
               forms of phantoms which were in fighting attitudes. Abbâ Isidore saith unto him,
               <quote>Look to the east,</quote> and when he looked he saw innumerable holy angels standing
               [there], and they were in a state of great glory. Then Abbâ Isidore said unto him,
               <quote>Behold, those who are in the west are those who are fighting with the holy ones, and
               those whom thou hast seen in the east are they who are sent by God to the help of the
               saints, for those who are with us are many.</quote> And having seen [these] Abbâ Moses took
               courage and returned to his cell without fear.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="563">
            <p>One of the old men said concerning the lustful thoughts which come into the heart of
               a man, and which are not carried into effect, that they are like unto a man who seeth
               a vineyard, and who desireth to eat the grapes thereof, but is afraid to go in lest
               he be caught and suffer death. If he be caught outside the hedge he will not die,
               because he hath neither gone into the vineyard nor hath eaten the grapes, but hath
               only desired; now he shall be beaten with few stripes, because he hath coveted, but
               he shall not die.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="564">
            <p>There was a certain old man, who lived in a cell, and his thoughts said unto him,
               <quote>Go, take to thyself a woman</quote>; then he rose up straightway and kneaded together some
               mud, and made the figure of a woman, and he said to himself, <quote>Behold thy wife! It is
               necessary for thee to labour with all thy might that thou mayest be able to feed
               her.</quote> And he laboured with his hands and twisted many ropes. Then after a few days,
               he rose up and made a figure of a woman, and said unto his thoughts, <quote>Behold, thy
               wife hath brought forth, it is necessary for thee to work harder to keep thy wife and
               to clothe thy daughter</quote>; and thus doing he vexed his body sorely. And he said unto
               his thought, <quote>I cannot bear [all] this work, and since I am unable to bear the work,
               a wife is unnecessary for me</quote>; and God saw his labour, and did away his thoughts [of
               fornication], and he had peace.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="565">
            <p>Abbâ Poemen used to say, <quote>As the sword-bearer standeth before the king, being always
               ready [to smite], so is it meet for the soul which is prepared to stand [ready] to
               resist the devil of fornication.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="566">
            <p>They used to say that Mother Sarah contended against the devil of fornication for
               seven years on the roof [of her house], before she vanquished him.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="567">
            <p>One of the old men said, <quote>It is written concerning Solomon that he loved women, but
               every male loveth the females, and we must restrain and draw onwards our nature by
               main force to purity.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="568">
            <p>A brother asked Abbâ Daniel, and said unto him, <quote>Deliver to me a commandment</quote>; [and
               he said unto him], <quote>Never place thy hand in a dish and eat with a woman, and thou
               wilt be able to flee from the devil of fornication.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="569">
            <p>They used to say that the great old man Abraham arrived at a monastery, and that he
               also saw there a youth, and that he refused to pass the night there; and the brethren
               who were with him said unto him, <quote>Art thou also afraid, O father?</quote> The old man said
               unto them, <quote>Indeed, my sons, I am not afraid, but of what use is a vain war to
               me?</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="570">
            <p>A brother asked an old man, saying, <quote>What shall I do? For my thoughts are [fixed]
               always upon fornication, and they will not give me peace even for a moment; and thus
               is my soul vexed.</quote> And the old man answered and said unto him, <quote>When these thoughts
               spring up in thee speak not with them, for it belongeth to them to rise up with
               continual anxiety, and not to be sluggish, but they have no power to force thee, for
               it belongeth to thee either to accept them or not. Hast thou not seen what the
               Midianites did, how they adorned their women and set them up, but they forced no man
               to take them? those who wished to do so fell into them, and those who did not became
               wroth, and made a slaughter in their wrath. Even so is it with the thoughts.</quote> Then
               that brother said unto him, <quote>What then shall I do? For I am weak, and passion
               overcometh me.</quote> The old man said unto him, <quote>Consider thy thoughts well, and when they
               begin to speak to thee, answer them never a word, but rise up and pray, and meditate
               upon holy words.</quote> And the brother said unto him, <quote>Behold, father, I do meditate [on
               holy words], and the passion riseth not in my heart, but I do not know the power of
               the words</quote>; then the old man answered and said unto him, <quote>Thou canst only [continue]
               to meditate, but I have heard Abbâ Poemen and many fathers say this word: <quote>The
               enchanter knoweth not the power of the words which he uttereth, but when the animal
               heareth them, it knoweth their power, and he becometh subservient, and submitteth
               itself [to him].</quote> Even so is it with us, for although we do not know the power of the
               words whereon we meditate, the devils know their power as soon as they hear
               them.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="571">
            <p>The old men in Scete were asked concerning fornication, <quote>When doth a man see a face
               in the passion stirred up in him?</quote> And they said, <quote>This matter is like unto a table
               which is loaded with meats of all kinds, and a man who seeketh and desireth to eat of
               them; but if a man putteth not forth his hand and taketh not of the meats he becometh
               a stranger unto them.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="572">
            <p>They used to say that Abbâ Isaac went out and found the footprint of a woman on the
               road, and he thought about it in his mind and destroyed it, saying, <quote>If a brother
               seeth it he may fall.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="573">
            <p>A brother asked Abbâ Agathon concerning fornication, and he said unto him, <quote>Go, cast
               thy feebleness before God, and thou shalt find relief.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="574">
            <p>A brother asked a father, and said unto him, <quote>There is a war of fornication against
               me,</quote> and the old man said unto him, <quote>If it be a good thing, why goest thou away from
               it, but if it be a bad thing why dost not thou command it [to depart]?</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="575">
            <p>A certain brother, being vexed by the spirit of fornication, went to a great old man,
               and entreated him, saying, <quote>Do an act of grace, and pray for me, for I am disturbed
               by fornication,</quote> and the old man made supplication unto God and entreated Him. And
               the brother came to him a second time, and said the same words as before, and the old
               man also was not neglectful in beseeching God on his behalf. Now when the brother had
               come to the old man, and troubled him in this way many times because he was disturbed
               by fornication, the old man afterwards entreated God, and said, <quote>O Lord, reveal unto
               me the manner in which this brother liveth, and whence cometh the reason why I have
               entreated Thee so often on his behalf, and he hath not found relief.</quote> Then God
               revealed unto him the affair of that brother, and he saw him dwelling with the spirit
               of fornication by him, and that brother lusting for it, and an angel was standing by
               [ready] to help him; and he was angry with that brother because he did not cast
               himself upon God, but was involving his mind therein. And straightway the old man
               knew that the cause lay with the brother himself, and he made him to undertand this,
               and he roused him up, and afterwards he took heed to himself.</p>

         <div type="saying" n="576">
            <p>A brother asked Abbâ Poemen, saying, <quote>The body is feeble, but my passions are not
               weak</quote>; the old man said unto him, <quote>The passions make thorns to grow and burst into
               flower.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="577">
            <p>A brother asked Abbâ Poemen concerning the passions of the body, and the old man said
               unto him, <quote>They are like unto those who sang praises to the image of Nebuchadnezzar,
               for if those who sang had not burned men [people] would never have worshipped the
               image; and in this wise the Enemy also singeth to the soul by means of the passions,
               so that he may perchance be able to make it commit sin through the passion of the
               body.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="578">
            <p>An old man used to say, <quote>Salt is produced by water, but if it falleth into water it
               becometh dissolved and is lost; similarly monks are born of women, but if they fall
               into women they are dissolved and perish from God.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="579">
            <p>A certain father when he went out to become a monk was a virgin, and he did not even
               know that a whore existed among the children of men. And when he was dwelling in his
               cell the devils began to stir up in him the passion of fornication, and lifting up
               his eyes he saw the devils going round about him in the forms of Ethiopians, and they
               incited him to yield to the passion; then he rose up straightway and prayed, and
               said, <quote>O Lord, help me,</quote> and when he had said these things immediately a stone fell
               from the roof, and he heard, as it were, a sweet voice, and he seemed to enjoy a
               short respite from the thoughts of fornication. And he rose up and came to one of the
               old men and related the matter to him, and the old man answered and said, <quote>I know not
               what this meaneth</quote>; and he sent him on to Abbâ Poemen, and that brother related the
               matter unto him also. Then the old man said unto him, <quote>The stone which thou didst see
               fall is the Calumniator, and that voice which thou didst hear is lust. Take heed unto
               thy soul, and make supplication unto God, and behold, thou shalt be freed from this
               war</quote>; and Abbâ Poemen taught him how to contend against devils, and having prayed, he
               dismissed him, and that brother came to his cell. And he made entreaty and
               supplication unto God, and God granted him to attain to such a gift [of excellence]
               that, when that brother died, He was pleased that there should be revealed unto him
               whether it was well with his soul or not.</p>
            <p>Now in another manuscript instead of the words, <quote>He rose up and prayed,</quote> it is thus
               written:—He saw the devils surrounding him in the forms of Ethiopians and they were
               inciting him to yield to the passion. And he said, <quote>This natural member which
               stablisheth man is like unto a spout in a tank which letteth out water, and it is
               also like a conduit which carrieth the water off a roof; similarly this member
               carrieth off water from a man.</quote> And having said these words straightway the stone
               fell, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>On one occasion a certain man went out to Scete to become a monk, and he took with
               him his son as soon as he had been weaned; and when the boy was grown up and had
               become a young man, the war of fornication attacked him, and he said unto his father,
               <quote>I will go into the world, father, for I cannot endure this striving against
               fornication.</quote> Then his father entreated him to persevere, but at length the boy said
               to his father, <quote>Father, I cannot bear it any longer, let me go</quote>; and his father said
               unto him, <quote>My son, hearken to me for this time only. Take thee seven pairs of cakes
               of bread, and a few palm leaves, sufficient for forty days, [and get thee into the
               desert], and may God’s will be done.</quote> And his son hearkened unto him, and he took
               [the bread and palm leaves] and departed, and he remained [in the desert] working,
               and twisting dry palm leaves into ropes, and plaiting mats, and eating dry bread, and
               he lived a life of seclusion for twenty days. And he looked, and behold, the work of
               fornication came and drew nigh unto him, and it stood up before him in the form of an
               Ethiopian woman whose smell was exceedingly foul; but he was unable to endure her
               smell, and he drove her away from his presence. Then she said unto him, <quote>In the
               hearts of men I am a sweet smell, and a pleasant one, but because of thine obedience
               and labour God hath not permitted me to lead thee astray; but I have, nevertheless,
               made thee acquainted with my smell.</quote> And the young man rose up, and came to his
               father, and said unto him, <quote>I no longer wish to go into the world, for I have seen
               the matter of fornication, and I have smelled its foul odour</quote>; now the father knew of
               a certainty that the young man had been satisfied in his mind on the subject, and he
               said to his son, <quote>Hadst thou remained [in the desert] forty days and kept my
               commandment, thou wouldst most certainly have seen a vision which was far more

               long.</quote></quote> Abbâ Poemen saith unto him, <quote>The labour of Abbâ Anicetus is high and exalted,
               and his thoughts are above with the angels, and he hath forgotten that I and thou are
               whoremongers; but if thou wishest, hearken unto me, and I also will speak to thee: If
               a monk can hold fast his belly, and his tongue, and his love for going about as a
               stranger, thou mayest be sure that he is able to become a monk in very truth, and
               that he will not die.</quote></p>

            <p>There was in Scete a certain monk who strove hard [against sin], and the Enemy sowed
               in him the remembrance of a certain woman with a beautiful face, and he troubled him
               greatly through her. And by the Providence of God a certain brother who came down
               from Egypt went to visit him, and it came to pass that whilst they were conversing
               together the brother who had gone to visit him said, <quote>Such and such a woman is dead</quote>;
               now she was the very woman the remembrance of whom was being stirred up in the monk.
               And when the other brother heard this, he rose up, and took his headcloth, and went
               up by night to Egypt, and opened her grave, and he smeared himself with the filthy
               and putrefying matter of the dead body of the woman, and then went back to his cell.
               And he set that thing of filth before his mind at all times, and he did battle with
               his thought, saying, <quote>Behold thy lust, and that which thou didst require! Behold, I
               have brought it unto thee; take thy fill thereof.</quote> And he used to torture himself
               with [the remembrance of] that filthy thing until the war which was in him was

               what is ours to do. Let us stand up in prayer, and straightway he will flee; be

               answered and said, <quote>If thou hast no minds (or thoughts) thou wilt have no hope, so
               then their work is with thee; for he who performeth their work hath no thoughts.
               Peradventure thou hast the custom of talking with a woman?</quote> And the brother said unto
               him, <quote>No, I have not, but they are thoughts of former times and of recent times which
               trouble me.</quote> The old man said unto him, <quote>Thou shalt not be afraid of the dead, but
               fear the things which are living, and cast thyself down in prayer before God. For if
               we have no thoughts we are mere animals. As the enemy worketh for that which is his,
               even so let us do for that which is ours. Let us stand up in prayer, and let us have
               a care for doctrine, and let us endure, for patient endurance is victory. Unless a
               man striveth he will never be crowned. For there are in the world athletes who though
               wounded conquer nevertheless, and however many times one man may be wounded by two
               [others], if he can endure the blows he will be able to conquer those who smote him.
               Observe then what a degree of endurance is possessed by such men for the sake of the
               merchandise of this world! Do thou then endure, and God shall strive with thine
               enemies on thy behalf whilst thou mayest remain quiet.</quote></p>

               can never become a habitation for others, and we can never give our souls over to
               become vessels for the service of aliens. For our Lord Who dwelleth in us, and is
               found in us, is able to watch over our lives; and it is not right for us to neglect
               or to hold lightly Him for Whose sake we have put Him on, and Whom we see. But let us
               make ourselves pure even as He is pure. Stand up then upon a rock, and if the river
               be violently disturbed thou shalt not fear, and behold, thy building shall not shake;

            <div type="saying" n="594">
               <p>NOW on thy account, O son of man, Christ was born, and the Son of God came that He
                  might make thee to live. He became a Child. He became a man, being also God. He
                  Who was the Lawgiver became a reader [of the Law], and He took the Book in the
                  congregation, and He read, saying, <quote>The Spirit of God is upon me, and for this
                  reason He hath anointed me, and hath sent me to preach the Gospel unto the poor.</quote>
                  Like a servant He made a whip of rope, and He drove forth from the temple all
                  those who sold oxen, and cattle, and doves, and other things. Like a servant He
                  girded a napkin about His loins, and washed the feet of His disciples, and He
                  commanded them to wash the feet of their brethren. Like an elder He sat among the
                  elders, and taught the people. Like a Bishop He took bread, and blessed [it], and
                  brake, and gave to His disciples; and He was beaten for thy sake, that is to say,
                  for thy sake He was crucified, and for thy sake He died. Yet thou for His sake
                  wilt not even endure insult! He rose as God. He was exalted as God. All these
                  things for our sake, all these things by Divine Providence, all these things
                  properly and in due order did He do that He might redeem us. Let us then be
                  watchful, and strenuous, and constant in prayer, and let us do everything which
                  will please Him, and will gratify His friends, so that we may be redeemed and
                  live. Was not Joseph sold into Egypt, and did he not live in an alien land? And
                  the three simple young men in Babylon, had they not men who opposed them? Yet,
                  because they were fearing God, He helped them, and made them glorious.</p>

                  lives wherein they act not in iniquity, and a man should not look upon evil things
                  with his eyes, nor hear with his ears things which are alien to the fear of God,
                  nor utter calumnies with his mouth, nor plunder with his hands; but he should give
                  especially to the poor, and he should not be [unduly] exalted in his mind, and he
                  should not think evil thoughts, neither should he fill his belly. Let him do then
                  all these things with discretion, for by them is a monk known.</quote> The old man also
                  said, <quote>These things [form] the life of a monk: Good works, and obedience, and
                  training. A man should not lay blame on his neighbour, and he should not utter
