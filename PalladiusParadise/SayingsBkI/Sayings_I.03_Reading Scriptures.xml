            Service Of The Psalms, And Of Constant Prayers</head>
         <div type="saying" n="105">
            <p>They used to say about Abbâ <persName>Arsenius</persName> that no man was able to attain to the manner of
               life in his abode. And they also said about him that on the night of the Sabbath
               which would end in the dawn of Sunday, he would leave the sun behind him, and would
               stretch out his hands towards heaven, and would pray [in this position] until the sun
               rose in his face, when he would satisfy his eyes with a little slumber.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="106">
            <p>A certain old man was complete in all perfection, and he could see what was happening
               from a very long way off; and he said, <quote>I once saw in a monastery a certain brother
               who was meditating on the study of God in his cell, and behold, a devil came and
               stood outside, and he wanted to go in, but he could not do so, so long as the brother
               was meditating. Finally, however, when the monk ceased his contemplation the devil
               was able to enter his cell, for his power is not able to vanquish those whose
               converse is with God.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="107">
            <p>An old man said, <quote>Whensoever a man readeth the Divine Books, the devils are
               afraid.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="108">
            <p>They used to say about Abbâ <persName>Pachomius</persName> that he spent much time in striving with devils
               like a true athlete, and after the manner of Saint <persName>Anthony</persName>. And because many devils
               came against him in the night season, he asked God to keep away sleep from him both
               by day and by night, so that he might not sleep at all, and might be able to bring
               low the might of the Enemy, even according to that which is written, <quote>I will not turn
               back until I have made an end of them</quote>; for they <pb n="24"/>are powerless against the faith
               which is in the Lord. Now this gift was given unto him, even as he had asked, for a
               certain time, and because he was pure, his heart used to see God, Who is invisible,
               as in a mirror.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="109">
            <p>They used to say about Abbâ <persName>Pachomius</persName> and Abbâ <persName>John</persName> that they lived together in the
               same religious house (now <persName>John</persName> was larger in stature than <persName>Pachomius</persName>), but both had
               adopted a life of poverty voluntarily, and they possessed nothing whatsoever except
               the fear of God. Whatsoever they gained by the work of their hands they gave to those
               who were in need, and they kept for themselves only what was sufficient for their
               bare necessities; in respect of clothes they were well-nigh destitute, and they had
               so few of them that they were obliged to wash those which they wore [and put them on
               again]. Now Abbâ <persName>Pachomius</persName> always wore a garment made of hair, because of the toil of
               his body. And whensoever they wished to refresh their bodies by a little sleep after
               their vigil and prayer, each of them would sit down in the middle of the cell, and,
               without leaning against a wall, would go to sleep. And they continued to do this for
               fifteen years, and many of the fathers heard of them, and saw them living thus, and
               they also strove in like manner to humble their bodies for the redemption of their
               souls.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="110">
            <p>They used to say about Abbâ <persName>Joseph</persName> that when he was about to die, and the old men
               were sitting about him, he looked at the window and saw <persName>Satan</persName> sitting there; and he
               cried out to his disciple and said, <quote>Bring me a stick here, for this devil thinketh
               that I have become old, and that I am no longer able to stand up against him,</quote> and as
               soon as he grasped the stick in his hand, <persName>Satan</persName>, in the form of a dog, threw himself
               from the window, and the old man saw him taking to flight.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="111">
            <p>They used to relate concerning Abbâ <persName>Sisoes</persName> that if he did not bring down his hands
               swiftly when he was standing up in prayer, his mind would be carried off on high; but
               whensoever it chanced that one of the brethren was with him he would bring his hands
               down hurriedly lest peradventure his mind should be carried off, and he should be
               left alone.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="112">
            <p>Abbâ <persName>Isaiah</persName>, the elder of the church, rebuked the brethren when they were eating that
               which had been prepared for them because they began to talk with each other, and he
               said to them, <quote>Hold ye your peace, O my brethren. I know a brother who eateth with us
               and drinketh with us full (?) cups even as we do, and yet his prayer ascendeth up
               before God like fire.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="113">
            <p>One day Abbâ <persName>Arsenius</persName> called Abbâ <persName>Alexander</persName> and <pb n="25"/>Abbâ <persName>Zôîlâ</persName>, and said unto them,
               <quote>Because the devils are striving with me, and because I do not know but that they may
               carry me off during [my] sleep, toil ye here with me this night, and keep vigil, and
               watch me and see if I sleep during [my] vigil.</quote> So they sat down, one on his right
               hand, and the other on his left, from the evening even until the morning. And they
               said, <quote>We slept and we woke up, and we did not observe that he slept at all; but when
               it began to be light there came unto us three times the sound of breathing in his
               nostrils, but whether he did this purposely so that we might think he slept or
               whether slumber had really fallen upon him we know not.</quote> And he stood up and said
               unto us, <quote>Have I been asleep?</quote> And we answered and said unto him, <quote>We do not know, O
               father, for we ourselves went to sleep.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="114">
            <p>A brother asked Abbâ <persName>Poemen</persName>, saying, <quote>How, and in what manner is it right for a man
               to walk in the path of righteousness?</quote> Abbâ <persName>Poemen</persName> said unto him, <quote>We have seen
               <persName>Daniel</persName>, and also that his enemies were unable to bring any accusation whatsoever
               against him except in respect of his service of God.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="115">
            <p>On one occasion Abbâ <persName>Sisoes</persName> was sitting in his cell, and when his disciple knocked at
               the door [meaning to] go in, the old man cried out, saying, <quote>Flee, <persName>Abraham</persName>, and do
               not come in now, for this place is not empty.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="116">
            <p>They say concerning Abbâ <persName>Sisoes</persName> of <placeName>Babylon</placeName> that, wishing to vanquish sleep, he stood
               upright upon a mountain crag, and that the angel of the Lord came and rescued him
               from that place, and commanded him never to do such a thing again, and not even to
               hand on this tradition to another.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="117">
            <p>An old man said, <quote>I knew a brother who used to sit with the brethren at the meal
               which is made for the coming of the brethren, and although the brethren ate and
               drank, he never made himself to be remote from converse with God in his prayer, and
               he did not drink even a cup of wine. Now this man’s manner of life was marvellous,
               and a certain man used to say about him, <quote>I once wished to count the prayers which he
               made, and I saw that he did not cease to pray either by day or by night.</quote></quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="118">
            <p>On one occasion a Bishop was sent secretly to Abbâ <persName>Epiphanius</persName> by the head of a
               certain monastery in <placeName>Palestine</placeName>, saying, <quote>We have not treated lightly thy services of
               prayer since thy departure from us, but we perform most carefully the services for
               the third, and sixth, and ninth hours, and also vespers.</quote> Then Abbâ <persName>Epiphanius</persName> blamed
               those who sent him, and wrote a message, which he sent to them, saying, <quote>Ye must know
               that ye are indeed neglectful of the services and prayers <pb n="26"/>which belong to the other
               eight hours which are in the day, for it is right for the monk who hath made himself
               to be remote from the world to be occupied with prayers to God unceasingly, and he
               should pray either in his heart, or in a carefully defined service, or in that
               service which he performeth with his will and with understanding. For the <persName>Calumniator</persName>
               addeth greatly to any small failing which he may find in a monk, and by being with
               him continually he enlargeth greatly the breach which he hath made, and by his habit
               of persistency he acquireth his natural power, and more particularly is this so in
               the case of those who are careless and lazy.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="119">
            <p>Abbâ <persName>Epiphanius</persName> also said, <quote>Whatsoever food thou wishest to eat with gratification,
               that give not to thy body, especially when thou art in good health, and that which
               thou lustest after, eat not; and when thou feedest upon the things which are sent
               unto thee by God, give thanks unto Him at all seasons, and receive His gracious gift,
               the delights and the pleasures which we have received through the name of monk,
               [although] we do not do the works of monks. And [if] it be that thou art a monk, wilt
               thou then not make thyself strong, lest peradventure thou art arrayed in apparel
               which is strange to thee? Tell me, O brother, dost thou possess the seal of the
               service, that is to say, humility? For the holy man who seeth another man sin weepeth
               bitterly, saying, <quote>It is this man who sinneth now, but some time subsequently it may
               be myself.</quote> However much then a man may sin before thee, condemn him not, but esteem
               thyself a sinner far greater than he is, even though he may be a child of this world,
               and besides there is the fact that he may have sinned greatly against God.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="120">
            <p>And he said also, <quote>Know thyself, and thou shalt never fall. Give thy soul work, that
               is to say, constant prayer, and love of God, before another can give it evil [and
               filthy] thoughts; and pray ye that the spirit of error may be remote from you.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="121">
            <p>And he also said, <quote>Whatsoever ye do successfully, and what ye boast of, destroy, for
               it is not right for a monk to boast of his fair deeds, and if he boasteth he will
               fall.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="122">
            <p>[And he also said], <quote>When thou prayest speak unto God in a quiet voice and say, <quote>How
               can I possess Thee, O Lord? Thou knowest full well that I am a beast, and that I know
               nothing. Thou hast brought me to the prime of this life, deliver me then for Thy
               mercy</quote>s sake; I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaiden, O Lord, by Thy will,
               vivify Thou me.’ The old man is falsehood, and the new man is truth; the truth is the
               root of good works, and falsehood is death. If the liar, and the thief, and the
               <persName>calumniator</persName> <pb n="27"/>knew that they would finally be made known unto all and [their works]
               revealed, they would never offend. And thus also was it with the adulterous sons of
               <persName>Eli</persName>, <persName>Hophni</persName> and <persName>Phinehas</persName>, for they were not priests of the Lord, and they feared not
               God, and they perished, together with all their house. And the man who taketh hold
               of, and bindeth to himself, and shutteth within himself the memory of evil things is
               like unto the man who hideth fire in straw. If thou speakest to a man concerning
               life, and if thou sayest a word unto him let it be with feeling, and penitence, and
               with tears; and say thy word to the man who will hearken and will do it, but if not,
               speak not, lest thou die, and thou depart from this world without any profit from the
               words whereby thou didst wish to give life unto others. For unto the sinner God
               saith, <quote>What hast thou to do with the Books of My Commandments? for thou hast taken
               My covenant in thy mouth [only]</quote></quote> (Psalm 50:16).</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="123">
            <p>Abbâ <persName>Epiphanius</persName> said, <quote>Whensoever a thought cometh and filleth thy bosom, that is to
               say, thy heart, with vainglory or with pride, say thou unto thyself, <quote>Old man, behold
               thy fornication.</quote></quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="124">
            <p>And he also said, <quote>If we do evil things God will be unmindful of His longsuffering;
               but if we do good things, it will not help us greatly because we increase the
               advantage of freedom, and the merchandise is not plundered thereby, for the will
               rejoiceth in the striving.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="125">
            <p>Certain brethren entreated Abbâ <persName>Epiphanius</persName> on one occasion, saying, <quote>Father, speak
               unto us some word of life, even though when thou speakest we may not grasp the seed
               of thy word, because the soil is salt.</quote> Then the old man answered and said unto them,
               <quote>Whosoever receiveth not all the brethren, but maketh distinctions between them,
               cannot become a perfect man. If a man revile thee, bless him, whether it be good for
               both of you, or whether it be not; it will be he who will receive a reward of
               blessing. This is the right way for a monk to live, and in this way lived Abbâ
               <persName>Arsenius</persName>, who took care each day to stand up before God without sin, and he drew nigh
               unto Him with tears like the sinful woman. In this manner pray to the Lord God—as if
               He were standing before thee, for He is nigh unto thee and He looketh upon thee. It
               is right that the man who wisheth to dwell in the desert should be [as] a teacher in
               his knowledge, and he must not be in need of instruction lest he be swept away by the
               devils; and he must look into his mind most minutely, both in respect of the things
               which are above, and those which are below, lest he become a laughing-stock unto them
               <pb n="28"/>by some means or other. It is right that the manner of life of the man who loveth God
               should be blameless.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="126">
            <p>A certain man made answer to the brethren against evil thoughts, saying, <quote>I entreat
               you, O my brethren, let us cease from ascetic works, and let us give up also anxious
               thoughts. For what are we? A voice which cometh out of the dust, or a cry which
               riseth from the mud? When <persName>Joseph of <placeName>Ramah</placeName></persName> had asked to be allowed to take the body of
               <placeName>Jesus</placeName>, he took it, and wrapped it round in a sheet of clean linen, and then he laid
               it in a new sepulchre of the new man</quote> (St. Matthew 27:59).</p>

         <div type="saying" n="127">
            <p>On one occasion a certain monk saw a devil who was calling to his fellow to come with
               him, so that the two together might wake up a monk for service, and might lead him
               into error thereby, [and cause him to think] that angels had appeared unto him. And
               the monk heard the voice of the other devil, who made answer to his fellow, saying,
               <quote>I cannot do this. For once I woke him up, and he stood up and broke me with a
               terrible breaking, and [all the time he was doing it] he sang psalms and prayed.</quote></p>

            <p>A brother asked an old man and said, <quote>Why is it that when I go forth to labour I feel
               wearied and disgusted in my soul, and my mind is wholly empty of spiritual thoughts?</quote>
               And the old man said unto him, <quote>Because thou dost not desire to fulfil that which is
               written, <quote>I will bless the Lord always, and His praises shall be ever in my mouth</quote>
               (Psalm 34:1). Therefore, whether thou art inside or outside, and whithersoever thou
               goest thou must not cease from blessing God; not only in actions, but with word and
               mind thou shalt bless thy Maker. For God doth not dwell in any place which hath
               bounds and limits, but He is everywhere, and by His Divine Power He sustaineth all
               things, and is capable of all things.</quote></p>

               said unto him, <quote>This matter is like unto that of a man who hath a fire on his left
               hand, and a tank of water on his right hand; if he wisheth to extinguish the fire, he
               taketh the water from the tank and doeth it, and it is right for a man to act thus
               every hour. Now the fire is the evil thought, which cometh from enemies, and the
               water is the pouring out of the soul before the Lord which a man should do.</quote></p>

            <p>There was a certain monk who did not do any work whatsoever with his hands, but he
               prayed without ceasing; and at eventide he would go into his cell and find his bread
               laid there [for him], and he would eat it. Now another monk came <pb n="29"/>to him, who had upon
               him [materials] for the labour of his hands, and wheresoever he entered in he worked,
               and he made the old man, into whose cell he had entered, to work with him. And when
               the evening had come, he wished according to his custom, to eat, but he found
               nothing, and he therefore lay down in sorrow; and it was revealed unto him, saying,
               <quote>Whilst thou wast occupied in converse with Me, I fed thee, but now thou hast begun
               to work, thou must demand thy food from the labour of thy hands.</quote></p>

            <p>They tell the story that on one occasion, whilst the blessed <persName>Anthony</persName> was dwelling in
               the desert, thoughts of dejection and despair rose up in his mind, and he was in deep
               gloom of thought, and said unto God, <quote>Lord, I wish to live, but my thoughts will not
               permit me to do so. What shall I do in my tribulations to be saved?</quote> And he came a
               little nearer [to the town] from the place where he was, and he saw a man who was
               like unto himself, and was in his own form, and he was sitting down and twisting palm
               leaves into ropes; and this man rose up from his work, and prayed, and afterwards he
               sat down again and continued his work, and then he stood up once more, and prayed.
               Now the man was an angel who had been sent from God to correct and to admonish the
               blessed <persName>Anthony</persName>, who afterwards heard him say unto him, <quote>O <persName>Anthony</persName>, do thou also do
               this and live</quote>; and when <persName>Anthony</persName> heard this, the blessed man had great joy, and
               afterwards he did as the angel had done, and lived.</p>

            <p>They said concerning Abbâ <persName>John</persName> the Less that, on one occasion, he steeped the palm
               leaves for two baskets in water, and sewed one basket to the other without perceiving
               it until he came to the side of it, for his mind was led captive by the sight of
               God.</p>

            <p>And Abbâ <persName>Daniel</persName> used to say concerning Abbâ <persName>Arsenius</persName> that he would pass the whole
               night in vigil, and when, for the sake of nature, he wished for the approach of the
               morning so that he might have some relief, he would struggle against sleep, and say,
               <quote>Get thee gone, O wicked handmaiden</quote>; then he would snatch a very little slumber and
               stand up straightway.</p>

            <p>They used to say about a certain monk who lived in a monastery of the brotherhood,
               that although he kept frequent vigil and prayed he was neglectful about praying with
               the congregation. And one night there appeared unto him a glorious pillar of
               brilliant light from the place where the brethren were congregated, and it reached up
               into the heavens; <pb n="30"/>and he saw a small spark which [flew] about the pillar, and
               sometimes it shone brightly, and sometimes it was extinguished. And whilst he was
               wondering at the vision, it was explained to him by God, Who said, <quote>The pillar which
               thou seest is the prayers of the many [brethren] which are gathered together and go
               up to God and gratify Him; and the spark is the prayers of those who dwell among the
               congregation, and who despise the appointed services of the brotherhood. And now, if
               thou wouldst live, perform that which it is customary to perform with the brethren,
               and then, if thou wishest to do so, and art able to pray separately, do so.</quote> And the
               monk related all these things before the brotherhood, and they glorified God.</p>
