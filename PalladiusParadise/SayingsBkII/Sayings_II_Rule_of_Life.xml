         <div type="saying" n="1">
            <p>Two of the fathers entreated God to inform them as to the measure [of spiritual
               excellence] to which they had arrived, and a voice came to them which said, <quote>In
                  such and such a village of Egypt there is a certain man in the world who is called
                  Eucharistos, and his wife Mary, and ye have not as yet arrived at the same measure
                  as they.</quote> Now when the fathers heard [this] they marvelled, and they rose
               up and came to that village, and they enquired for and found the house and the wife
               of Eucharistos, and they asked her, saying, <quote>Where is thy husband?</quote> And
               she answered and said unto them, <quote>He is a shepherd, and he is in the field
                  pasturing sheep</quote>; and she brought them into her house. And when the evening
               had come her husband came from the sheep, and seeing the fathers he rejoiced with
               great joy, and he prepared a table [for them], and brought water that he might wash
               their feet. Then the fathers answered and said unto him, <quote>We will eat nothing,
                  but tell us what is thy work</quote>; and Eucharistos said unto them with great
               humility, <quote>I am a shepherd, and this is my wife.</quote> Now the fathers
               entreated him to inform them concerning his life and works, but he concealed the
               matter, and refused to speak. Finally they said unto him, <quote>God told us to come
                  to thee,</quote> and when Eucharistos heard this he was afraid, and he told them,
               saying, <quote>Behold, we inherited these sheep from our parents, and whatsoever God
                  provideth as [our] income from them we divide into three portions; one portion [we
                  devote] to charity, one portion to the love of strangers, and the remaining part
                  serveth for our own use. Since the time when I took this woman to wife we have not
                  defiled ourselves, and she is a virgin, and each of us sleepeth alone; at night
                  time we wear sackcloth, and in the daytime we put it off and array ourselves in
                  our [ordinary] attire, and no man hath known this thing until the present
                  moment.</quote> And when the fathers heard [this] they glorified God.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="2">
            <p>They say concerning Abbâ Anthony that on one occasion, when he was praying in his
               cell he heard a voice which said unto him, <quote>Anthony, thou hast not yet arrived
                  [at the state of excellence] of a certain man who is a tailor and who dwelleth in
                  Alexandria.</quote> Then Anthony rose up in the morning, and took a palm stick and
               departed to him, and when the man saw him, he was disturbed; and the old man said
               unto him, <quote>Tell me what thou doest, and how thou livest,</quote> and the tailor
               said unto him, <quote>I do not myself know that I do any good, and I know only that
                  when I rise up in the morning, before I sit down to the labour of my hands, I give
                  thanks unto God, and praise Him, and that I set my evil deeds before mine eyes,
                  saying, <quote>All the men who are in this city will go into the kingdom of God, because
                  of their alms and good deeds, except myself, and I shall inherit punishment for my
                  sins</quote>; and again in the evening, before I sleep, I do the same things.</quote> Now
               when Abbâ Anthony heard these things, he said, <quote>Verily, as the man who worketh
                  in gold, and who doeth beautiful work, cleanly, and in peace, even so art thou;
                  through thy beautiful thoughts thou wilt inherit the kingdom of God, whilst I, who
                  have passed the whole of my life in the desert, separated [from men], have never
                  overtaken thee.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="3">
            <p>Abbâ Anthony received a revelation in the desert, saying, <quote>In such and such a
                  city there is a man who resembleth thee; he is a physician, and he worketh and
                  giveth whatsoever he earneth to the poor and needy, and each day he, with the
                  angels, ascribeth holiness to God three times a day.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="4">
            <p>When Abbâ Macarius was praying in his cell on one occasion he heard a voice which
               said, <quote>Macarius, thou hast not yet arrived [at the state of excellence] of two
                  women who are in such and such a city</quote>; and the old man rose up in the
               morning, and took in his hand a palm stick, and he began to set out on the road to
               that city. Now therefore, when he had arrived at the city, and learned the place [of
               the abode of the women], he knocked at the door, and there went forth one of the
               women and brought him into the house. And when he had been sitting down for a little,
               the other woman came in, and he called them to him, and they came nigh and sat down
               before him. Then the old man said unto them, <quote>On your account I have made this
                  long journey, and have performed all this labour, and with great difficulty have
                  come from the desert; tell me, then, what works do ye do.</quote> And they said
               unto him, <quote>Believe us, O father; neither of us hath ever been absent from, or
                  kept herself back from, her husband’s couch up to this day; what work, then,
                  wouldst thou see in us?</quote> Then the old man made apologies to them, and
               entreated them to reveal to him and to show him their labour, and thereupon they said
               unto him, <quote>According to worldly considerations we are strangers one to the
                  other, for we are not kinsfolk, but it fell out that the two of us married two men
                  who were brethren in the flesh. And behold, up to this present we have lived in
                  this house for twelve years, and we have never wanted to quarrel with each other,
                  and neither of us hath spoken one abominable word of abuse to her companion. Now
                  we made up our minds together to leave our husbands and to join the army of
                  virgins, but, although we entreated our husbands earnestly to allow us to do so,
                  they would not undertake to send us away. And as we were unable to do that which
                  we wished, we made a promise between ourselves and God that, until death, no
                  worldly word should go forth from our mouths.</quote> Now when Macarius heard
               [this] he said, <quote>Verily, virginity by itself is nothing, nor marriage, nor life
                  as a monk, nor life in the world; for God seeketh the desire [of a man], and
                  giveth the Spirit unto every man.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="5">
            <p>They used to tell a story about certain brethren who were members of the household of
               Abbâ Poemen. Now whilst these men were dwelling in Egypt their mother wished to see
               them, but was unable to do so, and she watched for them as they were going to the
               church, and went out to meet them, but as soon as they saw her they went back to
               their cell and shut the door on themselves, and then their mother took up her stand
               by the door, and spake [unto them], and wept and sighed heavily. And when Abbâ Job
               heard her, he went in to Abbâ Poemen and said unto him, <quote>What shall we do in
                  respect of this old woman who is weeping by the door?</quote> Then Abbâ Poemen
               rose up and drew nigh to the door and pressed himself against it and, hearing her
               speaking in the deepest sorrow, he said unto her, <quote>Wilt thou, who art an old
                  woman, cry in this fashion?</quote> Now as soon as she heard his voice she wept
               the more, and she cried out, saying, <quote>I want to see my sons. For what is this
                  that I see in you? Peradventure I did not rear you? Peradventure I am not your
                  mother? Peradventure ye did not suck at my breasts? Peradventure ye did not go
                  forth from my womb? I am prevented by mine old age, but now that I have heard thy
                  voice my bowels have been moved.</quote> The old man said unto her, <quote>Dost
                  thou wish to see us here, or wouldst thou see us in that country [beyond the
                  grave]?</quote> She said unto him, <quote>My sons, if I do not see you here I
                  shall see you there.</quote> And the old man said unto her, <quote>If thou wilt
                  compel thyself not to see us here, thou shalt, in very truth, see us
                  there.</quote> Then the old woman departed, saying, <quote>Yea, my son, if I shall
                  see you there I shall not seek to see you here.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="6">
            <p>There was a certain old man who lived a life of such strict self-denial that he never
               drank wine. And when I arrived at his cell we sat down to eat, and one brought dates
               and he ate, and he took water and drank; and I said unto him laughingly, <quote>So
                  thou art angry with absinthe, O father? Since thou hast eaten dates and hast drunk
                  water, why dost thou not drink wine?</quote> And he answered and said unto me,
                  <quote>If thou takest a handful of dust and throwest it on a man will it hurt
                  him?</quote> and I said unto him, <quote>No.</quote> And he said unto me,
                  <quote>If thou takest a handful of water and throwest it over a man, peradventure
                  he will feel pain?</quote> and I said unto him, <quote>No.</quote> And he said
               unto me, And again, if thou takest a handful of chopped straw and throwest it over a
               man, peradventure it will cause him pain? and I said unto him, <quote>No.</quote>
               Then he said unto me, <quote>But if thou bringest [them all] and dost mix them
                  together, and dost knead them well, and dost dry them, thou mayest throw and hurl
                  the mass on the skull of a man and thou wilt not break it</quote>; and I said unto
               him, <quote>Yea, father, [that is true].</quote> And he said unto me, <quote>The
                  monks do not abstain from certain things without good reason, and thou must not
                  listen to the men who are in the world who say, <quote>Why do they not eat this, and why
                  do they not drink that?</quote> Is there not sin in them? Such people know not. Now we
                  abstain from certain things not because the things themselves are bad, but because
                  the passions are mighty, and when they have waxed strong they kill us.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="7">
            <p>On one occasion the priest of Scete went to the Archbishop of Alexandria, and when he
               had returned to Scete he wanted to send the brethren [to Alexandria], and he said
               unto them, <quote>I have heard you say that there is a large assembly of people in
                  Alexandria. Verily, I say unto you that I who went there did not see the face of
                  any man except the Archbishop.</quote> Now when they heard [this] they were
               disturbed, and said, <quote>Have they sunk into the ground, then?</quote> And he
               said, <quote>Nay, not so, but my thoughts did not compel me to look at a man</quote>;
               and when they heard [this] they marvelled, and they were greatly confirmed by these
               words [in their desire] to keep themselves from looking upon the vain things of the
               world.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="8">
            <p>One of the old men used to say: On one occasion the fathers were sitting and
               conversing together on the subject of ascetic excellence, and there was in their
               midst one of the old men who was a seer of visions, and he saw angels flying about
               over [the fathers]; but when they came to another subject of discourse, the angels
               departed, and he saw pigs rolling about among them and wallowing in the mire. And
               afterwards when the fathers renewed their conversation on spiritual excellence the
               angels came back and glorified God.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="9">
            <p>One of the fathers used to say that there were two brethren who were neighbours of
               his in the desert, and that one was a stranger and the other a native of the country;
               now the stranger was a man of little faith, but the native performed many works in
               the service of God. And it happened that the stranger died, and the old man, who saw
               divine visions, saw multitudes of angels bearing away in triumph his soul until it
               arrived in heaven. And an inquiry arose concerning this, and the old man heard a
               voice from heaven which said, <quote>He was certainly a negligent man, but because of
                  his being a stranger they opened unto him.</quote> And afterwards the man who was
               a native of the country died, and his kinsfolk came to him and buried him, and the
               old man saw that there were no angels with him, and he marvelled, and he fell on his
               face and entreated God to inform him how it was that the stranger who was a negligent
               man was worthy of glory, whilst the man who had all those labours [to his credit] was
               not granted the same thing. And he heard a voice which said, <quote>When the native
                  with all his works came to die, he opened his eyes and saw his kinsfolk weeping,
                  and his soul was refreshed; but the stranger, although he was negligent, saw none
                  of his kinsfolk, and he sighed and wept.</quote></p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="10">
            <p>One of the fathers told a story, saying: There was a certain monk in the desert of
               Linopolis, and a man who was in the world ministered unto him; and there was in the
               city a certain rich and wicked man who died, and he was accompanied to his burial by
               the whole city, and by the Bishop, with lights and great honour. Now the man who
               ministered to the monk went forth to give him some bread, but he found him dead and
               eaten by the panthers; and he fell upon his face before the Lord and said, <quote>My
                  Lord, I will not rise up from this place until Thou makest me to know why this
                  wicked man is buried with such great honour, and why this monk who served Thee by
                  night and by day hath come to such an end.</quote> And an angel came and said unto
               him, <quote>That wicked man did one good work, and he was rewarded here so that he
                  might not find even one pleasure in the world to come; but this holy man, because
                  he was a man who was adorned with divine virtues, although inasmuch as he was a
                  man he possessed certain shortcomings, will receive these things in the world to
                  come, so that there he may be found perfect therein.</quote> And having heard
               [this] he returned, and glorified God for His judgements because they are good.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="saying" n="11">
            <p>A brother asked an old man, saying, <quote>Is it the name or the work which maketh to
                  live?</quote> The old man said unto him, <quote>I knew a certain brother who was
                  praying on one occasion, and who thought within himself, saying, <quote>I wish to see
                  the soul of a righteous man, and the soul of a sinner when they are leaving the
                  body</quote>; and because God wished neither to make him grieve, nor to deprive him of
                  his desire, whilst he was sitting in his cell a wolf went in to him, and laid hold
                  of him by his clothes and dragged him outside, and then having pulled him along he
                  carried him to the outside of a certain city, and then he left him there and
                  departed.</quote></p>
            <p><quote>Now whilst he was sitting outside the city there was a man who lived in a
                  monastery, and who had gained renown, and and concerning whom a report had gone
                  forth that he was a monk of spiritual excellence; and this man was grievously
                  sick, and was waiting for the hour of his departure [from this world]. And that
                  brother looked on and saw the preparations which they were making, and the things
                  which they were putting ready for the event, namely, the wax candles, and the
                  lamps which they were trimming and preparing, and he saw that all the city was
                  weeping for him, and that his people were in grief, and saying, <quote>By his hand God
                  hath given us meat and drink, and by his hands He hath delivered us, and hath kept
                  us and the whole city alive; if anything happeneth to him we shall die.</quote> And when
                  the time for this man to end his life had come that brother looked, and saw, and
                  behold, the keeper of Sheol went in having in his hand a fork of fire with three
                  prongs, and he heard a voice which spake [to the keeper], saying, <quote>Thou shalt not
                  give his soul any rest, even for a moment, and thou shalt not shew any compassion
                  unto him when thou takest away his soul.</quote> Then he who had appeared to that brother
                  went in, and he drove that fiery, three-pronged fork which he had in his hand into
                  the heart of the dying man, and he tortured him for a long time, and then he
                  carried away his soul. And after these things, when that brother was going into
                  the city, he saw a certain brother who was a stranger, and who was lying sick in
                  the market-place, and there was none to care for him; and he remained with him for
                  one day, and at the time when his soul was departing the brother saw Gabriel and
                  Michael come for his soul, and they sat down, one on his right hand, and the other
                  on his left, and they stayed there entreating his soul and wishing to carry it
                  away. And since his soul refused to leave its body, Gabriel said to Michael, <quote>Lift
                  up his soul and take it, so that we may depart</quote>; and Michael said unto him, <quote>We
                  were commanded by our Lord to bring it out without pain and without suffering, and
                  therefore we cannot constrain it and do it violence.</quote> Then Michael cried out with
                  a loud voice, saying, <quote>Whatdost Thou command concerning this soul which will not
                  be entreated to come forth, O Lord?</quote> And there came unto him a voice which said,
                  <quote>Behold, I will send David and his harp, and all those who sing with him, so that
                  when the soul heareth the sweetness of their voices it shall come forth</quote>; and they
                  came down and surrounded the soul, and as they were singing psalms and hymns the
                  soul leaped forth, and it was rejoicing in the hands of Michael, and was taken up
                  on high with gladness.</quote></p>

               handiwork, and it chanced that he sat down by the door of a house of a rich man who
               was dying, and whose death was very near at hand; and as he was sitting [there] he
               looked and saw black horses, with their black riders, who were exceedingly terrible,
               and they held in their hands staves of fire. And when they had come to the door of
               the house, they set their horses outside, and they went in together, and as soon as
               the sick man saw them, he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, <quote>O Lord, help

               was in the desert he was occupied in fighting [his desire] to return to his wife whom
               he had married before [he became a monk], and when he related the matter to the
               fathers, they appointed him certain works, so that he might be kept back from the

               performed these works in excess, and at length his body became so emaciated that he
               was unable to rise up from his place. And, by the operation of God, a certain father
               who was a stranger came to the place of Scete, and he passed by the cell of that monk
               and found it to be empty; and as he passed by he said in his mind, <quote>How is it

                  through my wife, and I told the fathers the story, and they imposed upon me severe
                  labours; and having performed these my body hath become ill, and the war hath
                  waxed stronger against me.</quote> Now when the old man heard these things, he was
               grieved, and he said unto him, <quote>The fathers have imposed upon thee great
                  labours as if [thou hadst been] a mighty man, but if thou wilt hearken to my
                  feeble [voice] thou wilt relinquish those labours, and partake of a little food,
                  at the appointed time, and wilt sing and pray a little, and wilt cast thy business

            <p>Abbâ Daniel Parnâyâ, the disciple of Abbâ Arsenius, used to tell about a man of

               ignorance he considered and declared that the bread which we receive is not in very
               truth the Body of Christ, but a similitude of His Body. And two of the fathers heard
               this word which he spake, but because they knew of his sublime works and labours,
               they imagined that he had spoken it in his innocence and simple-mindedness; and they
               came to him and said unto him, <quote>Father, we have heard a thing from a man which
                  we do not believe, for he saith that this bread which we receive is not in very
                  truth the Body of Christ, but a mere similitude.</quote> And he said unto them,
                  <quote>It is I who have said this thing,</quote> and they entreated him, saying,
                  <quote>Thou must not say thus, father, but according to what the Holy Catholic
                  Church hath handed down to us, even so do we believe, that is to say, this bread
                  is the Body of Christ in very truth, and is not a mere similitude. As, in truth,
                  God straightway took dust from the earth, and fashioned man in His image, [and no
                  man is able to say that he is not the image of God], so also was it the case of
                  the bread of which He said, <quote>This is My Body,</quote> for it is not to be regarded as a
                  merely commemorative thing, and we believe that it is indeed the Body of
                  Christ.</quote> And the old man said, Unless I be convinced by the thing itself I
               will not hearken [to this]”; then the fathers said unto him, <quote>Let us pray to
                  God for the whole week on this mystery, and we believe that He will reveal [it]
                  unto us,</quote> and the old man agreed to this with great joy, and each man went
               to his cell. Then the old man prayed unto God, saying, <quote>O Lord, Thou knowest
                  that it is not from wickedness that I do not believe, but in order that I may not
                  go astray through ignorance, reveal Thou therefore unto me, O Lord Jesus Christ,
                  this mystery</quote>; and the two other old men prayed unto God and said thus,
                  <quote>O Lord Jesus Christ, make Thou this old man to have knowledge concerning
                  this mystery, and we believe that he will not destroy his labours.</quote></p>
            <p>And God heard the entreaty of the two fathers, and when the week was ended they came
               to the church, and the three of them sat down by themselves on one seat, and the old
               man was between the other two; and the eyes of their understandings were opened, and
               when the time of the Mysteries had arrived, and the bread was laid upon the holy
               table, there appeared to the three of them as it were a child on the table. And when
               the priest stretched out his hand to break the bread, behold the angel of the Lord
               came down from heaven with a knife in his hand, and he slew the child and pressed out
               his blood into the cup; and when the priest broke off from the bread small members,
               the old man drew nigh that he might partake of the Holy Offering, and a piece of
               living flesh smeared and dripping with blood was given to him. Now when he saw [this]
               he was afraid, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, <quote>I believe, O Lord,
                  that the bread is Thy Body, and that the cup is Thy Blood</quote>; and straightway
               the flesh which was in his hand became bread like unto that of the Mystery, and he
               took it and gave thanks unto God. And the old men said unto him, <quote>God knoweth
                  the nature of men, and that it is unable to eat living flesh, and for this reason
                  He turneth His Body into bread, and His Blood into wine, for those who receive Him
                  in faith.</quote> Then they gave thanks unto God for that old man, and because he
               had not permitted Satan to destroy him from his labours, and the three of them went
               to their cells in gladness.</p>

            <p>Abbâ Daniel used to say that Abbâ Arsenius told him a story, as if he were speaking
               of some other man, saying:—Whilst a certain old man was sitting in his cell, there
               came unto him a voice which said, <quote>Come hither, and I will shew thee the works
                  of the children of men</quote>; and he rose up and went out. And the voice led him
               out and shewed him an Ethiopian cutting wood, and he made up a large bundle and
               wished to carry it away, but he was unable to do so. Then instead of making the
               bundle smaller, he went and cut down some more wood, and added thereto, and this he
               did many times. And when he had gone on a little further, the voice shewed him a man
               who was standing by a pit drawing up water, which he cast in a certain hollowed out
               place, and when he had thrown the water therein it ran down again into the pit.</p>
            <p>And again the voice said unto him, <quote>Come, and I will shew thee other
                  things.</quote> Then he looked, and, behold, there was a temple, and two men, who
               were riding horses, were carrying a piece of wood as wide as the temple was, and they
               wanted to go in through the door, but the width of the wood did not permit them to do
               so, for they would not humble themselves to go in, one after his companion, and to
               bring it in end-wise, and therefore they remained outside the door. Now these are the
               men who bear the yoke of righteousness with boasting, and they will not humble
               themselves to make themselves straight and go in the humble way of Christ, and
               therefore they remain outside the kingdom of God. And the man who was cutting wood is
               the man who laboureth in many sins, and who, instead of repenting and diminishing
               from his sins, addeth other wickednesses thereunto. Now he who was drawing water is
               the man who doeth good works, and who, because other things are mingled in his good
               works, destroyeth his works thereby. Now it is meet that a man should be watchful in
               his labour, lest he toil in vain.</p>

            <p>There was a certain old man in the mountain of Athlîbâ (Athribis), and thieves came

               down the thieves, and they sent them to the governor, who shut them up in prison. And
               the brethren were sorry, and said, <quote>They were delivered into our hands</quote>;
               and they rose up and went to Abbâ Poemen, and informed him about the matter. Then he
               wrote to that old man, and said unto him, <quote>Thou must understand whence hath
                  come the first betrayal, and then thou wilt perceive how the second betrayal
                  arose; for if thou hadst not been betrayed first of all by those that were within
                  thou wouldst never have effected the second betrayal.</quote> Now when the old man
               heard the letter of Abbâ Poemen, who was famous throughout all that country, and who
               kept himself strictly secluded in his cell, and never went out, straightway he rose
               up and went into the city, and took the thieves out of prison, and thus the assembly

               full of water, and set [it] down, and at the season when he ate, being urged by the

                  filled a vessel with water, but when I came to eat my meal I found that it had

               lived in that country, came to Egypt to him, for the brother had already told him
               where he lived, and when the monk saw the brother he rejoiced greatly. Then the monk
               said unto the brother, <quote>Do [me an act of] love, and take me so that I may go to
                  Abbâ Poemen,</quote> and he took him to Abbâ Poemen, and the brother told him the
               story of the monk who was with him, saying, <quote>He is a great man, and is much
                  beloved, and he hath no small honour in his own country. I related unto him
                  stories concerning thy holiness, and he greatly desired to come and see
                  thee</quote>; and Abbâ Poemen received him with gladness, and having saluted each
               other they sat down. Then the stranger began to converse with Abbâ Poemen from the
               Scriptures concerning spiritual and heavenly things, but Abbâ Poemen turned away his
               face and returned him no answer whatsoever. And when he saw that Abbâ Poemen would
               not speak unto him, he was grieved, and went outside, and said unto the brother who
               had brought him, In my opinion I have toiled in vain in coming all this long journey
               to see the old man, for behold, he refuseth to speak to me.” Now when the brother
               went in to the old man Poemen, he said unto him, <quote>Father, this great man, who
                  is so greatly praised in his own country, came on thy account; why didst thou not
                  speak with him?</quote> Poemen said, <quote>He spake about the things which are
                  above and concerning heavenly matters, but I can only talk about thing’s which are
                  below and about the things of earth; had he spoken to me about the passions of the
                  soul I would have given him an answer; but since he talked about spiritual things,
                  I know nothing about them.</quote> Then that brother went forth to the monk and
               said unto him, The old man is not one of those who wish a man to talk to them from
               the Scriptures, but if thou wilt converse with him about the passions of the soul he
               will return thee answer.” And straightway the monk repented, and he came to the old
               man, and said unto him, <quote>Father, what shall I do so that I may bring into
                  subjection the passions of the body?</quote> Then the old man looked upon him
               gladly, and said unto him, <quote>Now thou art welcome! Open now thy mouth on such
                  matters as these, and I will fill it with good things.</quote> And the monk,
               having been greatly helped, and having gained benefit, said, <quote>In very truth
                  this is the way of truth</quote>; and he went back to his country, giving thanks
               to God that he had been held worthy of such converse with the holy man.</p>

                  serpents</quote> (St. Matthew 10:16). And the Apostle [Paul] also admonished the
                  Corinthians to the same effect, saying, My brethren, be not childish in your
                  minds, but be ye as babes in respect of things which are evil, and be ye perfect
                  in your minds’ (1 Corinthians 14:20). Now wisdom without simplicity is wicked
                  cunning, and it is the subtlety of the philosophers among the pagans of which it
                  is said, <quote>He catcheth the wise men in their own cunning</quote> (Job 5:13; 1 Corinthians

                  be accustomed to look towards God only. Now the heart of the palm tree is also
                  white by reason of that fire which it possesseth naturally, and all the service of
                  the righteous man is in his heart; and the hollowness and the evenness of the tops

                  endurance, self-denial, labour, humility of body, and constant prayer. And a man
                  should not consider the shortcomings of men, but his own lapses; if now a man will
                  persist in these things the soul will after no great time make manifest the fruits
                  of spiritual excellence.</quote></p>

            <p>Abbâ John used to say, concerning the soul which wisheth to repent, thus: There was a
               certain harlot in the city who had many lovers, and a certain judge came and said
               unto her, <quote>Consent to lead a good life, and I will marry thee</quote>; and she
               agreed, and he took her and brought her up to his house. Now when her lovers wanted
               her, they said, <quote>A judge hath taken her up to his house, and if we go to his
                  door, and he learn about it he will punish us. But let us come behind the door and
                  whistle to her, and she will recognize the whistle and will come down to us, and
                  we shall be blameless.</quote> And when the harlot heard the sound of the
               whistling, she sealed up the hearing of her ears, and she jumped up and went into the
               inner bed-chamber, and shut herself in. Now the harlot is the sinful soul, and the
               lovers are the passions, and the judge is Christ, and the house is the wakeful mind,
               and those who whistle to the soul are the wicked devils; but the soul always fleeth

                  man, for behold, we have dwelt with him for many years, and we never before saw
                  him in such grief and suffering as this? Perhaps we have in some way offended
                  him.</quote> Then they threw themselves on their faces before the feet of the old

                  if we have] forgive us for Jesus’ sake.</quote> And the old man made answer to
               them in a state of grief, saying, <quote>Forgive ye me, O my brethren, for I am not
                  offended by you, but I am grieved by myself, because I see that I am going
                  backwards rather than forwards, and that I am the cause of offence and loss, not
                  only to myself but also unto all the others. For I see that at this present we are
                  trafficking, and are losing in respect of our souls very much more than we ever
                  gained at any time of the profit of the fear of our Lord, because shamelessness
                  and fearlessness have gained dominion over us. For in times past when the fathers
                  were gathered together to each other they were wont to form bands and ascend into
                  the heavens, but we are lax folk, and are dead in our sins. Whensoever we draw
                  nigh to each other we come to speak that which is hateful about one another, and
                  one by one we are raised up that we may descend to the bottom of the deepest
                  abyss. And we do not make to sink ourselves and each other only, but also the
                  fathers who come to us, and the strangers who gather together to us, and also the
                  people who are in the world who visit us as if we were solitary monks, and as if
                  we were holy men, and to these last we become a cause of stumbling and
                  loss.</quote></p>
            <p><quote>For thus also did Abbâ Sylvanus and Abbâ Lôt say unto me: <quote>Let us not abide
                  here any longer.</quote> And when I asked them, <quote>Why do ye depart from us?</quote> they spake to
                  me as follows: <quote>Up to this day we have benefited by our abiding with the fathers,
                  but from the time of Abbâ Pambô, and Abbâ Agathon, and Abbâ. Petra, and Abbâ John,
                  the commandments of the fathers have been held lightly, and we do not observe the
                  ordinances and the laws which our fathers laid down for us. And by assemblies
                  together we suffer loss over and over again through the useless things which are
                  spoken among us. And when we sit down at table, instead of doing so in the fear of
                  God, and with gratitude, and eating that which God hath prepared for us with
                  praise and thanksgiving, we occupy ourselves by conversing together and telling
                  insipid stories; and as we sit at table in this fashion we become so much changed
                  that we do not even hear what is being read to us on account of the noise of the
                  profitless talk which we hold with each other. And besides this, after we have
                  risen up from eating, we converse together with empty talk. What benefit is it to
                  us to live in the desert, seeing that we profit nothing thereby?</quote> And Abbâ Lôt
                  said, <quote>Many times have I heard from brethren who are strangers, and from the
                  people who live in the world, and who come to visit us, that we hold the
                  commandments of the fathers lightly, and they have said of us, <quote>We should never
                  have thought that they were monks!</quote> </quote> And one of the brethren who were
               strangers said, <quote>I have come to the fathers on several occasions, and [I see that]
               year by year they certainly observe less and less the early rules and conduct of the
               fathers.</quote> What now do ye wish? Will ye correct your lax behaviour, and observe
               carefully the commandments of our fathers, or must I also depart from you?</quote></p>
            <p>And it came to pass that when the brethren heard these things, they beat the board
               for assembling the monks, and the whole brotherhood gathered itself together, and
               Abbâ Joseph spake unto them all the words which are [written] above. And when all the
               brethren heard the words of Abbâ Joseph, and learned the reason of his pain and
               grief, and that he wished to depart from them, they cast themselves down upon their
               faces weeping, and they expressed their contrition to him, saying, <quote>Forgive us,
                  O father, for the sake of Jesus. We have made God angry by our deeds, and we have
                  caused thy holiness grief.</quote> Then each of the fathers said, <quote>Would
                  that thou hadst rebuked us on the very first day wherein thou didst hear [about
                  us] from the fathers, and that they had not departed from us! And would, too, that
                  we had roused ourselves up from our slumber and sluggishness! But what are we to
                  do? For the old men and the holy men do not teach us, and they do not even take
                  their proper places in our congregations, or when we sit at meat. Very many of us
                  wish to hear the histories and commandments of the fathers read, either whilst we
                  are sitting at table or between one sitting and the next, but we are never able to
                  hear a word of their talk.</quote> And Abbâ Elijah said, <quote>Abbâ Abraham and
                  Abbâ John spake much at table, and at the time of reading, and at the time of the
                  service; and they began to become excited against each other, and the one said,
                  <quote>Father, such and such a man is excited,</quote> and the other said, <quote>Such and such a man
                  maketh us excited.</quote> Now when Abbâ Joseph saw that the whole brotherhood was
                  stirred up, he made supplication unto them, and besought them, saying, <quote>I beseech
                  you, O my brethren, to cease from your commotion, for God hath called us to peace,
                  and I therefore beg you to come and pray, and to make supplication unto God that
                  He may make to pass by us the legions and the host of the enemy. For, behold, I
                  see them standing up in wrath and anger, with their swords drawn, and they wish to
                  destroy us all if God doth not stand up to help our wretchedness.</quote></quote></p>
            <p>And when he had said these things he was able, with some difficulty, to quiet them,
               and Abbâ Joseph himself began to sing the words of the harpist David, saying,
                  <quote>Their swords shall enter their own hearts, and their bows shall be broken,
                  and God shall make them like a wheel and as dust before the wind. And God shall
                  arise and all His enemies shall be scattered. O God, deliver me, O Lord, remain to
                  help [me]</quote> (Psalm 37:15; 83:13; 68:1; 7:1). And when they had recited the
               Psalms of the spirit altogether, and had made an end of the service, they said,
                  <quote>O holy God, O holy mighty One, O immortal holy One, have mercy upon
                  us</quote>; and they all knelt down in prayer. And as they were praying they heard
               the voices of the devils in the air, and the sounds of armour and of horses, and of
               many horsemen, and they also heard the voices of the devils who were saying to one
               another, <quote>Ye shall not have mercy upon them.</quote> And again they said,
                  <quote>O luckless monks, why do ye stand up against us?</quote> If we were to do
               [what we could do] to you not one of you would be found on the face of the earth! We
               will never be absent from you, and we will never cease from you.</p>
            <p>And after the filthy legion had been driven away by the secret power, and the wicked
               devils rested from their wickednesses, all the fathers rose up from the earth whereon
               they had been poured out in prayer, the earth having been adorned by their tears, and
               they all offered repentance unto Abbâ Joseph, saying, <quote>Forgive thou us, and
                  pray for us that the Lord may forgive us, for we have sinned and have provoked Him
                  to wrath.</quote> Then Abbâ Joseph said unto them: <quote>Rouse ye yourselves, O
                  my brethren, and take good heed unto your souls, for, behold, ye have heard with
                  your ears the sound of the chariots of the Adversary, who threateneth us and
                  seeketh to destroy us. Let every man be reconciled to his neighbour, and forgive
                  ye every man from his heart the offence [which he hath committed]. And bind ye
                  yourselves with the love of our Lord, with an urgent mind, and a pure heart, to
                  the Lord and to each other. And draw nigh unto God that He may draw nigh unto you,
                  and stand up against the Adversary, who is Satan. If ye wilt observe the
                  commandments of the fathers, I will become a surety (or pledge) for you that Satan
                  shall not be able to injure you, and that the Barbarians shall not come hither;
                  but if ye will not observe them, believe me, O my beloved, this place shall be
                  laid waste.</quote></p>
            <p>And they offered repentance each to the other, and they became reconciled to each
               other, and lived in love and in great peace; and they laid down ordinances among
               themselves on that day to the effect that no man should henceforth conduct himself
               with negligence and without absence of fear; and that they should neither do nor say
               anything at the table which was alien [to their mode of life]; and that if any man be
               found hereafter despising and holding lightly the commandments of the fathers in such
               a way that he become an occasion of offence and a cause of loss, first to himself,
               and next to those who dwell with him, and then also to the strangers who come to us,
               he shall know that he is bringing a punishment upon him self, and that he shall
               become an alien to all the brotherhood. And Abbâ Joseph sent a brother to bring back
               Abbâ Sylvanus and Abbâ Lôt, and when these fathers knew what had taken place among
               the brethren, and that they had laid down ordinances to keep the commandments of the
               fathers, they praised God, and they rose up, and came, and [when] they saw Abbâ
               Joseph they saluted him and wept; and Abbâ Joseph told them everything which had
               taken place, and they glorified God Who had not rejected those who feared Him. And as
               regardeth the canons and the ordinances which they had laid down among themselves,
               the brethren observed and performed them all the days of their life; and they died at
               a good old age, [after] living lives which were well-pleasing unto God.</p>

               him to do; and the brother went to his house with a sad mind. And on the first day he
               brought [to the monk] as the result of his labour a few garden herbs, and the monk
               took them and gave them to the old men, and entreated them to pray for him; and he

               did [with them] as he did at first. Then he came a third time, and brought many
               costly gifts, and wine, and fish, and his brother saw [this] and wondered, and he
               called the poor and relieved them therewith. And the monk said unto his brother who
               was in the world, <quote>Peradventure thou art in need of a little bread, O my
                  brother?</quote> And he said unto him, <quote>Nay, my lord, whilst I took from
                  thee that which used to enter into my house, I spent everything I had; but since I
                  ceased to take anything from thee, God hath blessed me and hath had mercy upon
                  me.</quote> Then the monk went and informed the old man everything which had taken
               place, and the old man said unto him, <quote>Knowest thou not that the labour of a
                  monk is fire, and that wheresoever it entereth it consumeth? But it is beneficial
                  for him to shew mercy from his own toil, and prayer from the holy men shall be
                  upon him, and thus he shall be blessed.</quote></p>

               with lamentation and tears said, <quote>Where is the mind of this brother who can

            <p>There was a certain priest in Thebaïs whose name was Dioscurus, and he was the
               spiritual father of many monks, and at the time when they were about to receive the
               Holy Mysteries he used to say to the brethren, <quote>Take thought and see lest any
                  man among you have been snared by the phantom of a woman during the night, and he
                  be so bold as to receive the Holy Mysteries. Now the emissions which occur as the
                  result of a phantom are not caused by the desire of a man, but take place
                  independently thereof, for they happen naturally, and are due to the excess of
                  matter [in the body], and they do not, therefore, lead [a man] into subjection to
                  sin. But the phantoms which arise from the desire are the sign of an evil wish.
                  For it is meet that the monk should be superior to the law of nature, and that he
                  should not be found with the smallest impurity of body, but that he should waste
                  the body and humble it, and should not permit any superfluity of matter to be
                  found therein. Work out plans, then, that thou mayest cut off [the superfluity of]
                  matter by means of a long period of fasting, for if we do not thus it will in cite
                  the other lusts to come upon us; and it is not meet that a monk should be occupied
                  with the lusts which rise up in him daily. And if we do not thus, in what way are
                  we different from those who live in the world? For we have observed that men of
                  this kind often make themselves to be remote from the desires of their lust,
                  either for purposes of bodily health, or for other reasons which are not worth
                  mentioning; how very much more, then, should it thus be especially a care to the
                  monk for the sake of the health of his spirit, and of his soul, and of his
                  body!</quote></p>

               which were opened straightway, and the panther gave them suck, and took them and went
               inside. And on the day following the panther came bringing a sheepskin, and she
               approached and placed it before him; then the old man smiled to himself at the

               sufficient for his wants. And after a little time, when he had obtained freedom of
               speech, he began to be proud and to exalt himself above the other brethren, saying,
                  <quote>They lack education, and the knowledge of learning</quote>; and the blessed
               Mâr Basil, the Bishop, sent him a message in a letter, saying, <quote>Thou hast lost

            <p>They used to say that when Abbâ. Macarius was walking in the desert, he went and
               found a beautiful spot which was like unto the Paradise of God; and there were in it
               fountains of water, and numerous palm trees, and trees of various kinds which bore
               fruit, and when he had come and told the brethren about it, they begged and entreated
               him to go and settle them there. Then the old men, the aged members of the
               congregation, who led lives of stern labour, entreated them not to leave their place,
               and they said, <quote>If pleasure and delight be found in that spot, and if a man may
                  live therein without vexation and labour, what pleasure and delight do ye expect
                  to receive from God? Nay, it is right for us to endure the hardness of this place

            <p>There was a monk who lived in a cell, far away in the desert, and this monk had a
               brother who lived in the world, and whose end was nigh, for he had to die; and he
               sent a message to the monk, saying, <quote>For God’s sake do an act of grace, and
                  come that I may see thee before I die.</quote> And when the monk heard [this], he
               shut the door of his cell, and set out to go to him, and as he was travelling through
               the desert, he saw an old man sitting on the wayside mending nets; now this old man
               was the Calumniator, who was making ready his snares to catch in them those who were
               journeying on the road of spiritual excellence. And he was exceedingly anxious to
               overthrow that brother, and to trip him up by his snares, for he had not only never
               allowed his foot to become entangled in the meshes of his nets, but he had also slit
               in pieces and destroyed his pitfalls through the remembrance of God. Now the monk did
               not know that the man who was sitting by the roadside mending his nets was Satan, and
               he said unto him, <quote>Why art thou sitting here in this parched desert? And what
                  art thou doing here?</quote> The Calumniator said unto him, <quote>I am mending my
                  nets wherewith I wish to catch the gazelle which are in the desert.</quote> And
               the monk said unto him, <quote>Make me a net also, for I want to catch with it the
                  gazelle which go into my garden and lay it waste.</quote> Then that devil said
               unto him, <quote>Get thee on thy journey, and I will make a net for thee which shall
                  be better than that which thou now seest.</quote> And when the monk had gone to
               his brother, he saw him, and remained with him for two days, and on the third day his
               brother died; and he wrapped him up in his graveclothes, and buried him with the
               honour which is due to believing men. And as he was lying there in his brother’s
               house, his brother’s wife rose up by night, and came and lay down by his side through
               the agency of the Calumniator, and she began to say unto him thus:—<quote>God hath
                  sent thee hither to provide for thy brother’s children, and to bring them up; take
                  me, then, to wife, and take care of thy brother’s house and of his children, and
                  stay here in peace in thine own house.</quote> And when the monk had heard what
               she said to him, he was moved to wrath against her, and he said to her, <quote>Fie
                  upon thee, O woman! Get thee behind me, Satan!</quote> And he rose up straightway,
               and took his staff, and set out to go through the desert to his cell, and as he was
               journeying along the way, he saw that old man sitting in his place and mending his
               nets; and the monk said unto him, <quote>Art thou still sitting here, O old man? Hast
                  thou prepared for me that net concerning which I spake to thee?</quote> Then Satan
               became furious, and he looked at him in fierce anger and said, <quote>Get thee forth
                  from my presence. Yea, thou hast indeed broken the net which I made for thee.
                  Didst thou not know that thou wast breaking and slitting in pieces during the past
                  night that other net which was better than the first one? I am not able to make a
                  net which [will catch] thee.</quote> And as he was speaking he changed himself
               into a great serpent. Now when the monk saw this he understood that it was Satan who
               had appeared unto him; and he fled from the place in fear, and went to his cell, and
               he gave thanks unto God Who had delivered him from the snare of Satan, who had wished
               to snare him and to drag him down into his net through his brother’s wife.</p>

            <p>On one occasion Abbâ Abraham went to Abbâ Arêâ, and whilst they were sitting talking,
               a certain brother also came to Abbâ, and repeated the following:—There was a certain
               rich man in Jerusalem who had become rich by means of fraud, and avarice, and
               oppression, and wicked acts of various kinds; and when this man came to himself, and
               understood that there was judgement to come, he drew nigh to a certain teacher, and
               said unto him, <quote>I beseech thee [to hearken unto me]. My mind is led captive by
                  worldly care, and by anxieties which are of the earth; make me whole then, so that
                  I may not perish.</quote> And the teacher gave him to read the Book of the Wisdom
               of Solomon, and as he was reading [it], he found a verse which said, <quote>He who
                  hath compassion upon the poor, lendeth to God.</quote> Then he shut the book, and
               gave it to the teacher, saying, <quote>Who is there that is more sure and more to be
                  trusted than God, Who if I shew compassion upon the poor, will give me back both
                  principal and interest?</quote> Then he went immediately, and sold everything
               which he possessed and divided it among the poor, and he left nothing whatsoever of
               it to himself except four dînârs, which were to be [spent] in burying him; and he
               fell into want, and became exceedingly poor, and he went about begging, but no man
               either shewed compassion upon him or gave him food. Finally he meditated within
               himself, and said, <quote>I will go to the Lord my God, and will enter into judgement
                  with Him because He led me astray and made me scatter all my possessions.</quote>
               Now as he was returning to Jerusalem, he saw two men fighting with each other, and
               each was striving to take from his companion a certain stone of great excellence,
               which had fallen from the ephod which was on Aaron, the high priest; now the men did
               not know what the stone was. Then the man said unto them, <quote>Why are ye fighting
                  and contending with each other?</quote> And they answered and said unto him,
                  <quote>We have found a stone, and we do not know what its value is</quote>; and he
               said unto them, <quote>Give it to me, and take four dînârs,</quote> and they gave him
               the stone gladly. Then the man went into Jerusalem and shewed the stone to a
               goldsmith, who, as soon as he saw the stone, said unto him, <quote>Where didst thou
                  find this? For behold, because [of the loss] thereof all Jerusalem hath been in an
                  uproar for the last three days. But go, and give it to the high priest, and he
                  will make thee a rich man.</quote> Now when he had gone into the temple, the angel
               of the Lord appeared unto the high priest, and said unto him, <quote>Behold, a man
                  hath come unto thee, and he hath with him the stone which was lost; give him,
                  then, gold and silver, and precious stones according to his desire, and rebuke him
                  and say unto him, <quote>Have no doubt whatsoever in thy mind, and restrain not thyself
                  from lending to God as if thou wert not a believer and a true man, for, behold, I
                  have given unto thee twofold in this world [for what thou didst lend Me], and in

            <p>And the fathers also said:—There was a rich philosopher in a certain city and he

               thus until he had scattered all the riches which he possessed. Now when the day
               arrived for him to go forth from the world, he commanded his household, saying,

               he made them to do. And after many days the Bishop came to the city, and he went to
               the kinsfolk of the philosopher, and he comforted them and said unto them, <quote>Did
                  he not give you any commands? And did he not make a will?</quote> And they said
               unto him, <quote>When he was dying he made us swear that the paper of indebtedness
                  should be laid with him [in the grave], and we did even as he said.</quote> And
               the Bishop said unto them, <quote>Come ye and <quote>shew me his grave,</quote> and when he
               had gone and entered into the grave, he saw the paper laid on the breast of the
               philosopher, and he took it, and opened it, and found that there was written in it
               thus, <quote>I, the philosopher So-and-so, have gone to Christ, and everything which
                  I lent unto Him He hath returned unto me many times over; and henceforward I have

            <p>Abbâ Joseph, the priest of Ascalon, told us the following story, saying: There was a
               certain merchant in Ascalon who borrowed from other people much money, and he hired a
               ship for himself and put out to sea; and a fierce storm rose up against him, and he
               lost everything which he had with him; but he himself was saved. And when he returned
               to the city those to whom he owed money seized him, and they took everything which he
               had in his house, and sold it, and shut him up in prison; but they left him his wife
               as an act of charity, so that she might beg for him and feed him. And the woman went
               about from door to door, and she herself begged for bread for her husband; and one
               day as she was sitting and eating bread with her husband, one of the chief men of the
               city went in to give alms to the prisoners who were there, and he saw the woman and
               lusted for her, for she was beautiful. And he sent his servant to call her, and she
               came thinking that he wished to give her alms; but he took her aside, and said to
               her, <quote>Why hast thou come here?</quote> And she related unto him the whole
               matter. Then he said unto her, <quote>If I pay one-third of thy husband’s debt wilt
                  thou lie with me this night?</quote> And that chaste, free woman said unto him,
                  <quote>I have heard that the holy Apostle said, <quote>A woman hath no power over her
                  body, but her husband.</quote> I will first ask my husband, and whatsoever he commandeth
                  me that will I do.</quote> And having come she told her husband, and he was
               grieved; and he wept, and said unto her, <quote>Go, and say unto him, <quote>I have told my
                  husband, and it hath not pleased him, and I have hope in God that He will not
                  forsake us.</quote></quote> Now there was in the prison-house a certain thief who had
               been a highway robber, and he was shut up [in a room] inside beyond them, and at that
               moment he happened to be sitting at a window which faced them, and he heard
               everything which they were saying; and with tears he said unto himself, <quote>Woe is
                  me! For although these people are in such great trouble, they are not willing to
                  deliver over their freedom, and accept money, and go forth from this place, but
                  they hold their chastity to be more valuable than riches. What then shall I, the
                  wretched one, do? For the thought that there is a God hath never entered my mind,
                  and I never remember that my evil deeds will be judged, and I have committed many
                  wickednesses, and many awful murders. And I know that when the judge cometh here
                  he will kill me without asking a question, as is just.</quote> And he answered and
               said unto the woman and her husband, <quote>Because I see that ye preserve the purity
                  of your bodies for Christ’s sake, and that ye have chosen to remain in great
                  tribulation and not to destroy your chastity, God hath put it into my heart to do
                  unto you an act of grace which ye deserve, and perhaps God will shew me mercy
                  through you on the day of judgement. Go ye to the northern side of the city wall,
                  and dig there in a certain place, and behold, ye shall find there a large earthen
                  pot, beneath which is a vessel full of gold. Take it, and pay your debt, and may a
                  great blessing abide with you so that you may live upon it; but I beseech you to
                  pray for me continually, that I may find mercy before God in the day of
                  judgement.</quote></p>
            <p>And after three days the judge came to the city, and he ordered them to cut off the
               head of that thief without [asking any] questions, and after he had been slain, that
               noble woman said unto her husband, <quote>Wilt thou command me to go and see if that
                  which the thief said is true?</quote> And he said unto her, <quote>Go.</quote> And
               she went at the time of evening, and by the indications which the thief had given
               her, she found the place, and having dug a little she found the money, even as he had
               told her, and she took it and went to her house, giving thanks unto God. And she
               brought it out little by little, and she gave it to the creditors, who thought that
               she brought it to them as the result of her begging, a little from here and a little
               from there; then when she had paid her husband’s debt, he came forth from prison,
               thanking and glorifying God.</p>
            <p>Then Abbâ Joseph said unto us, <quote>Behold these men, O my brethren! Because they
                  chose to live in affliction, and refused to despise the command of God, God
                  multiplied His grace unto them without delay. For even if the woman had hearkened
                  unto that lascivious man he might not, perhaps, have given her what he promised
                  her; but because they preserved their chastity which is pleasing to God, God
                  rewarded her with the whole amount of their debts, and brought them to a greater
                  state of prosperity than [that which they enjoyed] at first. And, my beloved, I
                  think thus concerning Adam when he was in Paradise. Had he kept that little
                  command, honour greater than that which he had at first would have come to him;
                  but when he transgressed the command of his Lord, he fell from and was driven out
                  of the delight and pleasure wherein he lived. May our Lord make us worthy to keep
                  His commandments! Amen.</quote></p>

                  vessel, and a body without a soul, and eyes without light, and a dead body without

                  open to destroy the simple lambs, and the panther which leapeth upon the gazelle
                  in the desert, and the ship which saileth on the sea with an evil spirit for her
                  steersman, and the savage beast which cannot be subdued, and which walketh on

               <head>Against the Change of the Evil Will of Those Men Who Deny the Grace which is
                  Performed towards Them</head>
               <p>One of the teachers said, <quote>If thou hast made thyself humble, they despise
                     thee without discernment. If thou hast made thyself angry, they hate thee
                     without understanding. If thou hast made thyself pleasant, they swallow thee,
                     and thou disappearest. If thou hast made thyself bitter (or cruel), they reject
                     thee, and thou art reviled. And if thou hast mingled with folk they hold thee
                     to be a liar fair[-spoken], and wandering. If they have fallen ill, they
                     command thee, and if they are despised, they judge thee; if they be visited,
                     they abuse thee; and if thou art whole, they leave thee; and if they are
                     reclining, they drive thee away; and if aught be required from them, they curse
                     thee; and if mercy be shown unto them, they oppress thee. Neither grace (or
                     goodness), nor justice will ever please those who belong to every evil of every
                     kind.</quote></p>
