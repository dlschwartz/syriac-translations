         <head>Of the Monk who fell</head>
         <p>And by the side of these blessed men I saw a man who also had made himself remote from
            the world, and he dwelt in holes in the rocks even as did they; now this man was mocked
            at by the devil of vainglory, and by the visions which he saw, and he was deluded (or
            snared) by things which appeared to <pb n="277"/>approach him and then wandered away. And he was
            lacking in mind, even as it is written, <quote>Being exalted in his dreams he pastureth
            spirits and pursueth after a shadow</quote>; now he was chaste in his body, perhaps owing to
            the length [of his years], or perhaps through vainglory, yet through the matters of
            spiritual excellence he destroyed his understanding, and he was corrupted by empty and
            polluted glory, and because of this he departed from the straight road of the ascetic
            life.</p>
