         <head>Of the Blessed <persName>Gaddai (Gaddanus)</persName>, the Palestinian</head>
         <p>And I saw a certain old man whose name was <persName>Gadd√¢i</persName>, who lived without a shelter all his
            days in the places which were by the side of the Jordan. On one occasion the Jews rose
            up against him in fierce hatred (or zeal) by the side of the <placeName>Dead Sea</placeName>, and they drew the
            sword against him, and one of them took up a weapon to smite him, when the following
            great and wonderful thing was wrought upon the man who dared to lift up a sword against
            the blessed man: the hand of the man who had drawn the sword withered immediately, and
            the sword itself fell upon the ground.</p>
