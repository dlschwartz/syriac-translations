         <head>Chapter 19: Of a certain solitary Monk who used to feed on Grass by the Jordan</head>
         <p>A certain monk was feeding on grass by the Jordan, and at noontide he went into a cave
            to rest, and he found there a lion which began to roar; and he said to the lion, <quote>What
            vexeth thee? There is room enough here both for thee and for me, and if thou dost not
            wish [for a companion], get up and go out;</quote> and because the lion could not bear [him],
            he rose up, and went out.</p>
