         <head>Chapter 32: Of <persName>a certain excellent Bishop who fell into Fornication</persName>, and <persName>the People
            having walked upon him he was forgiven</persName>.</head>
         <p>There was a certain bishop in one of the cities, who through the working of the
            <persName>Calumniator</persName> fell into fornication; and one day when the congregation was in the church,
            although no one knew of the Bishopâ€™s sin, he voluntarily confessed it before all the
            assembly, and said, <quote>I have fallen into fornication.</quote> Then he took off the vestments
            which were on him, and laid them upon the altar, and said, <quote>I cannot, henceforward, be
            your Bishop.</quote> And all the people cried out with tears, saying, <quote>Let this sin be upon us;
            only remain thou in thine episcopate.</quote> And he answered and said unto them, <quote>If ye wish
            me to remain in my episcopate, do ye that which I shall say unto you</quote>; and he commanded,
            and all the doors of the church were shut with the exception of one, and he threw
            himself down upon his face, and said, <quote>The man who goeth out from the church without
            walking upon me shall have no portion with God</quote>; and they did according to his word, and
            when the last man had gone out, a voice was heard which said, <quote>Because of his great
            humility I have forgiven him his sin.</quote></p>
