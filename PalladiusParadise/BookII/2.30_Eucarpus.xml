         <head>Chapter 30: Of <persName>Eucarpus</persName></head>
         <p>And there was also in the desert a certain man whose name was <persName>Eucarpus</persName>, who had passed
            eighteen years shut up in his cell; and the food which was necessary for his wants was
            brought by others. He had lived in seclusion for fifteen years, and he never spoke to
            any man [during that period] except when he was in need of something. He used to write
            upon paper [what he wished to say], and would give it to those who ministered unto him,
            and he also did thus when any man asked him a question or spoke to him; his food
            consisted of vegetables soaked in water, and pounded garden herbs, and he carried out
            his rule of life with infinite labour. Finally, however, the devils made him a
            laughing-stock also, because of the vain opinion which he had concerning himself. First
            of all he separated himself from mingling with the brethren and conversing with them,
            and next he ceased to meditate on the Holy Scriptures, and he did nothing except pray
            continually; for he was proud and haughty in his mind, and he thought that he was
            perfect, and that on account of the purity of his heart, forsooth, he was always seeing
            God in his mind, for he that tempteth tempted him also, even as he had tempted the
            blessed man Job. And one night <persName>Satan</persName> appeared unto him in the form of an angel of light,
            and said unto him, <quote>I am <persName>Christ</persName></quote>; and when <persName>Eucarpus</persName> saw him, he thought that the
            appearance was a real person, and he fell down, and worshipped him, and said unto him,
            <quote>Master, what commandest thou thy servant [to do]?</quote> And he who had appeared unto him
            said unto him, <quote>Since thou hast excelled many in thy works, and hast kept all my
            commandments, I desire greatly to make my abode with thee; but since thou art perfect,
            it is not necessary for thee to shut thyself up, and it is no longer right that thou
            shouldst live in seclusion, but thou must teach all the brethren not to destroy their
            souls with the reading of the Scriptures and the reciting of the Psalms. And they must
            not labour in the toil of the body, and they must not vex their souls with fasting, and
            hunger, and thirst, but they must labour with the labour of the soul, for by these means
            they shall be able speedily to be lifted up to <pb n="262"/>the highest grade, and they must always
            look at me with their minds, and I will shew them my glory. And as for thee, since thou
            hast raised thyself above all the monks by thy works, behold, I make thee this day a
            chief and a governor over all the monks who dwell in <placeName>Scete</placeName>. For <persName>Macarius</persName> is not of as
            much use as a governor as thou art.</quote> Then <persName>Eucarpus</persName> was more lifted up in his mind than
            before, and he was far more proud, and he believed truly the error of the Crafty One,
            and his understanding was taken away from him, and he was smitten in his mind
            immediately he had worshipped the <persName>Calumniator</persName>.</p>
         <p>Now on another day there was a congregation in the church, and <persName>Satan</persName> appeared unto
            <persName>Eucarpus</persName> a second time, and said unto him, <quote>Go thou this day, for all the brethren are
            gathered together, and teach them everything which I commanded thee yesterday in the
            night season.</quote> Then <persName>Eucarpus</persName> opened the door of the house wherein he secluded himself,
            and departed to go to the church; and it happened that Abbâ <persName>John</persName> was sitting by the side
            of the church, and the brethren were round about him, and were asking him about their
            thoughts. And when <persName>Eucarpus</persName> came, and saw <persName>John</persName> with the brethren surrounding him, he was
            filled with envy of him, and he answered and said unto <persName>John</persName> with haughtiness and wicked
            wrath, <quote>Why dost thou adorn thyself and dost sit down, like a whore, who wisheth to
            multiply her friends? Or, who commanded thee to be a corrector of others, seeing that it
            is I who am the governor of the monastery?</quote> Now when the brethren heard [these words],
            they were greatly moved, and said unto him, <quote>And who made thee a governor in <placeName>Scete</placeName>?</quote> And
            <persName>Eucarpus</persName> said unto them, <quote>Yesterday in the night I was made governor by <persName>Christ</persName>,
            therefore turn ye to me, and I will teach you the way, whereby ye shall easily ascend to
            the high grade of the vision of glory; and moreover, go not ye astray after the writings
            of <persName>Evagrius</persName>, neither hearken ye unto the words of <persName>John</persName>, for ye have wandered far enough
            into error already.</quote></p>
         <p>Then he began to revile the fathers, and he called <persName>Macarius</persName> a <quote>painted idol</quote> whom those
            who err worship, for he knoweth not how to lead the brethren on the path towards
            heavenly things; and <persName>Evagrius</persName> he called <quote>a hewer of words</quote> who hath led the brethren
            into error by following his writings, and hath made them to cease from spiritual
            service. And the devils made a mock of <persName>Eucarpus</persName> until they were able to lift him up and
            to dash him down upon the earth, but all these things which fell upon him took place
            because he condemned the brethren, and because through his pride and arrogance he held
            them in contempt, and because he did not desire to meditate upon the <pb n="263"/>Holy Scriptures,
            and on the doctrine of the fathers. And finally, when the fathers saw that he was
            smitten in mind, they threw iron fetters on him and bound him therewith, and he lived
            with them upon him; and the holy fathers offered up prayer on his behalf for eleven
            whole months, and then his mind returned to him, and he was so thoroughly cured of his
            pride that he perceived his weakness, and recognized his disease whereby he had been
            made a mock of by the devils. And in him was fulfilled that which was said, <quote>Old blains
            (or wounds) are cured by burnings,</quote> and, <quote>Thou who didst exalt thyself to heaven shalt
            be brought down even unto Sheol</quote> (Isaiah 14:13–15). Now <persName>Eucarpus</persName> lived after he had been
            cured of his arrogance one year and one month; and the fathers commanded that he should
            minister unto the sick, and that he should wash the feet of strangers, and thus he
            died.</p>
