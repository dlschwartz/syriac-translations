         <head>Chapter 8: The Triumph of a Disciple of <persName>one of the Old Men</persName></head>
         <p>On a certain occasion the disciple of a great sage (i.e., old man) had a war of
            fornication, and when the old man saw that his brother was vexed and oppressed in his
            mind, he said to him, <quote>Dost thou wish me to entreat God to make the war less fierce?</quote>
            And the brother said, <quote>Father, I perceive that, although I toil and am afflicted, I am
            yet able to see the fruit which I possess within my soul through this strife, [therefore
            pray not for this thing]; but entreat God especially in thy prayer to give me strength
            to endure.</quote> His father said unto him, <quote>This day I know that thou hast surpassed me
            therein.</quote></p>
