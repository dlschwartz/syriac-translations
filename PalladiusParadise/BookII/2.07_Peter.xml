         <head>Chapter 7: The Triumph of Peter, the Disciple of one of the Old Men</head>
         <p>There was a certain old man who had an excellent disciple, and on a certain occasion the
            old man by reason of his hasty temper drove him away, and turned him outside the door,
            and his apparel with him; and the brother sat down outside the door and waited
            patiently, and when the old man opened the door he found him sitting outside. Then the
            old man repented, saying, <quote>O Peter, the meekness of thy longsuffering nature hath
            vanquished my hasty temper; henceforward thou shalt be my old man and father, and I will
            be thy servant and disciple. By thy good work thou hast made (or fashioned) mine old
            age.</quote></p>
