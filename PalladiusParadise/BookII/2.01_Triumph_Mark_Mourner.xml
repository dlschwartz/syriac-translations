         <head>Chapter 1. The Triumph of the Blessed Man <persName>Mark</persName> the Mourner</head>
         <p><persName>Macarius</persName> the priest told us the following story:â€”<quote>At the time when I was administering
            the Holy Offering I took good heed unto <persName>Mark</persName> the mourner, and I never gave it to him,
            but an angel did so from the altar; I saw, however, the palm of the hand of the angel
            who gave it unto him.</quote> Now this <persName>Mark</persName> was a young man, and he could repeat by heart the
            New and the Old Testaments; he was meek beyond measure, and both in body and in thought
            he was purer than many.</p>
