         <head>Chapter 26: The History of a certain Sage and of the watching of the Mind</head>
         <p>There was a certain old man who lived in his cell and performed mighty ascetic works,
            and who, whensoever the brethren of the Cells were gathered together for the vigil of
            the First Day of the week, would come to the general assembly, and would act in such a
            way as to make the brethren despise him, and indeed they regarded him as a man who had
            gone out of his senses, although he did everything with discretion. Now God, the Good
            and Compassionate, did not wish the labours of the old man to be hidden, but He revealed
            and made known some of them for the benefit of the community, and He sent angels, who
            were in the forms of rich and honourable men, to the priest of the Cells, and they came
            and saluted him; and when the priest saw them, he ran forward to meet them, for he
            thought that they who appeared to him were great and wealthy men, and he rose up
            immediately and saluted them. And after they had sat down and had held some converse
            with the old man, they besought him, saying, <quote>O father, we beg of thee to allow us to go
            round the Cells that we may be blessed by the Fathers</quote>; and he accepted their petition,
            and permitted them to do whatsoever they wished, and they asked him to send to them one
            of the brethren. Then the priest called one of the brethren, and commanded him to go
            with them, and beckoning him aside he said unto him secretly, <quote>Take heed lest thou take
            them to the cell of that [mad] old man, for when they see that he hath lost his reason
            they will be sorry they have met him.</quote> And when they had come out to go to the Cells,
            the honourable men fell down before the priest of the Cells, and said unto him, <quote>O
            Father, give our brother orders to take us to see all the fathers,</quote> and the priest said
            unto them, <quote>I have commanded him to take you to them all.</quote> And having gone to the
            fathers of the Cells, and visited them, they returned to the priest in his cell, and he
            said unto them, <quote>Are ye gratified now that ye have seen the fathers?</quote> And they said unto
            him, <quote>O father, we are gratified, but we are sorry about one thing, that is to say,
            because thou didst command the brother who went with us that we should not see all the
            fathers.</quote> Then the priest called the brother who had gone with them, and said in their
            presence, <quote>Did I not tell thee to take the brethren to all the cells?</quote> And the brother
            said, <quote>Yea, father, thou didst tell me to do so, and I took them to all the cells, and
            they have seen all the brethren.</quote> Then the honourable men said to the priest, <quote>Forgive
            us, father, but there are some of the fathers whom we have not seen, and we are greatly
            grieved thereat; but say a prayer on our behalf so that we may depart.</quote></p>
         <p>And after the priest had prayed over them, and they had departed from him, he called the
            brother who had gone with them, and said unto him, <quote>How did these men know what I
            ordered thee [to do]? Didst thou, perchance, reveal it unto them?</quote> And the brother made
            repentance, and said, <quote>Forgive me, father, but I did not reveal [thy orders] unto them.</quote>
            Then the priest knew that the matter was from God, and he rose up straightway and went
            to that old man whom he thought to be out of his mind, and he fell down on his face
            before him, and laid hold upon his feet, and besought him to reveal unto him his ascetic
            works and labours; and he swore to the old man that he would not rise up from the
            ground, and would not let go his hold upon him until he had done so, saying to the old
            man likewise, <quote>That I should come to thee and that thou shouldst reveal thy labours unto
            me, are matters from God.</quote> Now the old man was unwilling to reveal his works, because he
            did not wish to be held in honour because of them, nevertheless he was compelled to do
            so because the priest had told him that the matter was from God, and he promised the
            priest to reveal unto him one thing; and when the priest heard the promise of the old
            man, he rose up from the ground, and seeing the old man in a gentle and tranquil frame
            of mind, he marvelled, because he had never before seen him as he was at that moment.
            Then the old man said unto the priest, <quote>Depart, O father, I did not know that I did even
            one good thing, but of such things which I have the following is one:â€”I have by my side
            two baskets, one on my right hand, and one on my left; for every good thought which
            springeth up in my mind I take a pebble and throw it into the basket which is on my
            right hand; and for every hateful thought which riseth in me, I also take a pebble and
            throw it into the basket which is on my left hand, and this I do every day. And when the
            time for the evening meal hath arrived, I take out the pebbles, and count them, and if
            the number of those which are in the basket of good thoughts on my right hand do not
            exceed those in the basket of evil thoughts on my left hand, I do not take any supper
            that evening; and if they do exceed, then I eat, and rejoice, for sometimes it happeneth
            that several days pass without my eating at all, because the pebbles of the good deeds
            do not exceed in number the pebbles of the bad ones. And whensoever an abominable
            thought cometh to me, I pass judgement on myself, and say, <quote>Take heed, for thou wilt not
            eat to-day!</quote> </quote> And having heard these things the priest praised God, the Lord of the
            universe, and he marvelled how the old man could perform such works of righteousness and
            yet keep them hidden from every man.</p>
