         <head>Chapter 20: Of a certain Holy Virgin</head>
         <p>Once certain of the great sages of Scete were travelling along a road in the desert when
            they heard a sound, like the groan of a sick person, [rise up] from the ground; and they
            searched, and found a path which led into a cave, and when they had descended into it
            they discovered [there] a certain holy virgin. Then they said unto her, <quote>O mother, when
            didst thou come here? And who ministereth unto thee?</quote> For they saw nothing in the cave
            except the holy woman herself who was lying on the earth. And she said unto them,
            <quote>Behold, I have passed eight and thirty years in this cave, and I have satisfied my
            wants with grass, for I labour for Christ. And I have never seen a man except this day,
            and God hath sent you to me this day to bury my body</quote>; and having said these words, she
            died. And when the fathers saw [this], they glorified God, and they buried her body, and
            prayed, and departed from the place.</p>
