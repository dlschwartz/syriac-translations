         <div type="section">
            <p>Here follows the defence which <persName>Aristides</persName> the philosopher made before Hadrian the King
               on behalf of reverence for God.</p>
            <salute>…All-powerful <persName>Cæsar Titus Hadrianus Antoninus</persName>, venerable and merciful, from
               <persName>Marcianus Aristides</persName>, an Athenian philosopher.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n1"/></salute>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="1">
            <p>I, O King, by the grace of God came into this world; and when I had considered the
               heaven and the earth and the seas, and had surveyed the sun and the rest of creation,
               I marvelled at the beauty of the world. And I perceived that the world and all that
               is therein are moved by the power of another; and I understood that he who moves them
               is God, who is hidden in them, and veiled by them. And it is manifest that that which
               causes motion is more powerful than that which is moved. But that I should make
               search concerning this same mover of all, as to what is his nature (for it seems to
               me, he is indeed unsearchable in his nature), and that I should argue as to the
               constancy of his government, so as to grasp it fully,—this is a vain effort for me;
               for it is not possible that a man should fully comprehend it. I say, however,
               concerning this mover of the world, that he is God of all, who made all things for
               the sake of mankind. And it seems to me that this is reasonable, that one should fear
               God and should not oppress man.</p>
            <p>I say, then, that God is not born, not made, an ever-abiding nature without beginning
               and without end, immortal, perfect, and incomprehensible. Now when I say that he is
               “perfect,” this means that there is not in him any defect, and he is not in need of
               anything but all things are in need of him. And when I say that he is “without
               beginning,” this means that everything which has beginning has also an end, and that
               which has an end may be brought to an end. He has no name, for everything which has a
               name is kindred to things created. Form he has none, nor yet any union of members;
               for whatsoever possesses these is kindred to things fashioned. He is neither male nor
               female.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n2"/> The heavens do not limit him, but the heavens and all things, visible and
               invisible, receive their bounds from him. Adversary he has none, for there exists not
               any stronger than he. Wrath and indignation he possesses not, for there is nothing
               which is able to stand against him. Ignorance and forgetfulness are not in his
               nature, for he is altogether wisdom and understanding; and in Him stands fast all
               that exists. He requires not sacrifice and libation, nor even one of things visible;
               He requires not aught from any, but all living creatures stand in need of him.</p>

         <div type="section" n="2">
            <p>Since, then, we have addressed you concerning God, so far as our discourse can bear
               upon him, let us now come to the race of men, that we may know which of them
               participate in the truth of which we have spoken, and which of them go astray from
               it.</p>
            <p>This is clear to you, O King, that there are four classes of men in this
               world:—Barbarians and Greeks, Jews and Christians. The Barbarians, indeed, trace the
               origin of their kind of religion from <persName>Kronos</persName> and from <persName>Rhea</persName> and their other gods; the
               Greeks, however, from <persName>Helenos</persName>, who is said to be sprung from <persName>Zeus</persName>. And by Helenos
               there were born <persName>Aiolos</persName> and <persName>Xuthos</persName>; and there were others descended from <persName>Inachos</persName> and
               <persName>Phoroneus</persName>, and lastly from the Egyptian <persName>Danaos</persName> and from <persName>Kadmos</persName> and from <persName>Dionysos</persName>.</p>
            <p>The Jews, again, trace the origin of their race from <persName>Abraham</persName>, who begat <persName>Isaac</persName>, of
               whom was born <persName>Jacob</persName>. And he begat twelve sons who migrated from <placeName>Syria</placeName> to <placeName>  </placeName>; and
               there they were called the nation of the Hebrews, by him who made their laws; and at
               length they were named Jews.</p>
            <p>The Christians, then, trace the beginning of their religion from <persName>Jesus the Messiah</persName>;
               and he is named the Son of God Most High. And it is said that God came down from
               heaven, and from a Hebrew virgin assumed and clothed himself with flesh; and the Son
               of God lived in a daughter of man. This is taught in the gospel, as it is called,
               which a short time ago was preached among them; and you also if you will read
               therein, may perceive the power which belongs to it. This <persName>Jesus</persName>, then, was born of
               the race of the Hebrews; and he had twelve disciples in order that the purpose of his
               incarnation<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n3"/> might in time be accomplished. But he himself was pierced by the Jews,
               and he died and was buried; and they say that after three days he rose and ascended
               to heaven. Thereupon these twelve disciples went forth throughout the known parts of
               the world, and kept showing his greatness with all modesty and uprightness. And hence
               also those of the present day who believe that preaching are called Christians, and
               they are become famous.</p>
            <p>So then there are, as I said above, four classes of men:—Barbarians and Greeks, Jews
               and Christians.</p>
            <p>Moreover the wind is obedient to God, and fire to the angels; the waters also to the
               demons and the earth to the sons of men.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n4"/></p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="3">
            <p>Let us begin, then, with the Barbarians, and go on to the rest of the nations one
               after another, that we may see which of them hold the truth as to God and which of
               them hold error.</p>
            <p>The Barbarians, then, as they did not apprehend God, went astray among the elements,
               and began to worship things created instead of their Creator;<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n5"/> and for this end
               they made images and shut them up in shrines, and lo! they worship them, guarding
               them the while with much care, lest their gods be stolen by robbers. And the
               Barbarians did not observe that that which acts as guard is greater than that which
               is guarded, and that everyone who creates is greater than that which is created. If
               it be, then, that their gods are too feeble to see to their own safety, how will they
               take thought for the safety of men? Great then is the error into which the Barbarians
               wandered in worshipping lifeless images which can do nothing to help them. And I am
               led to wonder, O King, at their philosophers, how that even they went astray, and
               gave the name of gods to images which were made in honour of the elements; and that
               their sages did not perceive that the elements also are dissoluble and perishable.
               For if a small part of an element is dissolved or destroyed, the whole of it may be
               dissolved and destroyed. If then the elements themselves are dissolved and destroyed
               and forced to be subject to another that is more stubborn than they, and if they are
               not in their nature gods, why, forsooth, do they call the images which are made in
               their honour, God? Great, then, is the error which the philosophers among them have
               brought upon their followers.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="4">
            <p>Let us turn now, O King, to the elements in themselves, that we may make clear in
               regard to them, that they are not gods, but a created thing, liable to ruin and
               change, which is of the same nature as man; whereas God is imperishable and
               unvarying, and invisible, while yet He sees, and overrules, and transforms all
               things.</p>
            <p>Those then who believe concerning the earth that it is a god have hitherto deceived
               themselves, since it is furrowed and set with plants and trenched; and it takes in
               the filthy refuse of men and beasts and cattle. And at times it becomes unfruitful,
               for if it be burnt to ashes it becomes devoid of life, for nothing germinates from an
               earthen jar. And besides if water be collected upon it, it is dissolved together with
               its products. And it is trodden under foot of men and beast, and receives the
               bloodstains of the slain; and it is dug open, and filled with the dead, and becomes a
               tomb for corpses. But it is impossible that a nature, which is holy and worthy and
               blessed and immortal, should allow of anyone of these things. And hence it appears to
               us that the earth is not a god but a creation of God.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="5">
            <p>In the same way, again, those erred who believed the waters to be gods. For the
               waters were created for the use of man, and are put under his rule in many ways. For
               they suffer change and admit impurity, and are destroyed and lose their nature while
               they are boiled into many substances. And they take colours which do not belong to
               them; they are also congealed by frost and are mingled and permeated with the filth
               of men and beasts, and with the blood of the slain. And being checked by skilled
               workmen through the restraint of aqueducts, they flow and are diverted against their
               inclination, and come into gardens and other places in order that they may be
               collected and issue forth as a means of fertility for man, and that they may cleanse
               away every impurity and fulfil the service man requires from them. Wherefore it is
               impossible that the waters should be a god, but they are a work of God and a part of
               the world.</p>
            <p>In like manner also they who believed that fire is a god erred to no slight extent.
               For it, too, was created for the service of men, and is subject to them in many
               ways:—in the preparation of meat, and as a means of casting metals, and for other
               ends whereof your Majesty is aware. At the same time it is quenched and extinguished
               in many ways.</p>
            <p>Again they also erred who believed the motion of the winds to be a god. For it is
               well known to us that those winds are under the dominion of another, at times their
               motion increases, and at times it fails and ceases at the command of him who controls
               them. For they were created by God for the sake of men, in order to supply the
               necessity of trees and fruits and seeds; and to bring over the sea ships which convey
               for men necessaries and goods from places where they are found to places where they
               are not found; and to govern the quarters of the world. And as for itself, at times
               it increases and again abates; and in one place brings help and in another causes
               disaster at the bidding of him who rules it. And mankind too are able by known means
               to confine and keep it in check in order that it may fulfil for them the service they
               require from it. And of itself it has not any authority at all. And hence it is
               impossible that the winds should be called gods, but rather a thing made by God.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="6">
            <p>So also they erred who believed that the sun is a god. For we see that it is moved by
               the compulsion of another, and revolves and makes its journey, and proceeds from sign
               to sign, rising and setting every day, so as to give warmth for the growth of plants
               and trees, and to bring forth into the air where with it (sunlight) is mingled every
               growing thing which is upon the earth. And to it there belongs by comparison a part
               in common with the rest of the stars in its course; and though it is one in its
               nature it is associated with many parts for the supply of the needs of men; and that
               not according to its own will but rather according to the will of him who rules it.
               And hence it is impossible that the sun should be a god, but the work of God; and in
               like manner also the moon and the stars.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="7">
            <p>And those who believed of the men of the past, that some of them were gods, they too
               were much mistaken. For as you yourself allow, O King, man is constituted of the four
               elements and of a soul and a spirit (and hence he is called a microcosm),<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n6"/> and
               without anyone of these parts he could not consist. He has a beginning and an end,
               and he is born and dies. But God, as I said, has none of these things in his nature,
               but is uncreated and imperishable. And hence it is not possible that we should set up
               man to be of the nature of God:—man, to whom at times when he looks for joy, there
               comes trouble, and when he looks for laughter there comes to him weeping,—who is
               wrathful and covetous and envious, with other defects as well. And he is destroyed in
               many ways by the elements and also by the animals.</p>
            <p>And hence, O King, we are bound to recognize the error of the Barbarians, that
               thereby, since they did not find traces of the true God, they fell aside from the
               truth, and went after the desire of their imagination, serving the perishable
               elements and lifeless images, and through their error not apprehending what the true
               God is.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="8">
            <p>Let us turn further to the Greeks also, that we may know what opinion they hold as to
               the true God. The Greeks, then, because they are more subtle than the Barbarians,
               have gone further astray than the Barbarians; inasmuch as they have introduced many
               fictitious gods, and have set up some of them as males and some as females; and in
               that some of their gods were found who were adulterers, and did murder, and were
               deluded, and envious, and wrathful and passionate, and parricides, and thieves, and
               robbers. And some of them, they say, were crippled and limped, and some were
               sorcerers, and some actually went mad, and some played on lyres, and some were given
               to roaming on the hills, and some even died, and some were struck dead by lightning,
               and some were made servants even to men, and some escaped by flight, and some were
               kidnapped by men, and some, indeed, were lamented and deplored by men. And some, they
               say, went down to Sheol, and some were grievously wounded, and some transformed
               themselves into the likeness of animals to seduce the race of mortal women, and some
               polluted themselves<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n7"/> by lying with males. And some, they say, were wedded to their
               mothers and their sisters and their daughters. And they say of their gods that they
               committed adultery with the daughters of men; and of these there was born a certain
               race which also was mortal. And they say that some of the females disputed about
               beauty, and appeared before men for judgment. Thus, O King, have the Greeks put
               forward foulness, and absurdity, and folly about their gods and about themselves, in
               that they have called those that are of such a nature gods, who are no gods. And
               hence mankind have received incitements to commit adultery and fornication, and to
               steal and to practise all that is offensive and hated and abhorred. For if they who
               are called their gods practised all these things which are written above, how much
               more should men practise them—men, who believe that their gods themselves practised
               them. And owing to the foulness of this error there have happened to mankind
               harassing wars, and great famines, and bitter captivity, and complete desolation. And
               lo! it was by reason of this alone that they suffered and that all these things came
               upon them; and while they endured those things they did not perceive in their mind
               that for their error those things came upon them.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="9">
            <p>Let us proceed further to their account of their gods that we may carefully
               demonstrate all that is said above. First of all, the Greeks bring forward as a god
               <persName>Kronos</persName>, that is to say Chiun<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n8"/> (Saturn). And his worshippers sacrifice their
               children to him, and they burn some of them alive in his honour. And they say that he
               took to him among his wives <persName>Rhea</persName>, and begat many children by her. By her too he begat
               Dios, who is called <persName>Zeus</persName>. And at length he (<persName>Kronos</persName>) went mad, and through fear of an
               oracle that had been made known to him, he began to devour his sons. And from him
               <persName>Zeus</persName> was stolen away without his knowledge; and at length <persName>Zeus</persName> bound him, and
               mutilated the signs of his manhood, and flung them into the sea. And hence, as they
               say in fable, there was engendered <persName>Aphrodite</persName>, who is called <persName>Astarte</persName>. And he (<persName>Zeus</persName>) 
               cast out <persName>Kronos</persName> fettered into darkness. Great then is the error and ignominy which
               the Greeks have brought forward about the first of their gods, in that they have said
               all this about him, O King. It is impossible that a god should be bound or mutilated;
               and if it be otherwise, he is indeed miserable.</p>
            <p>And after <persName>Kronos</persName> they bring forward another god <persName>Zeus</persName>. And they say of him that he
               assumed the sovereignty, and was king over all the gods. And they say that he changed
               himself into a beast and other shapes in order to seduce mortal women, and to raise
               up by them children for himself. Once, they say, he changed himself into a bull
               through love of <persName>Europe</persName> and <persName>Pasiphae</persName>.<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n9"/> And again he changed himself into the 
               likeness of gold through love of <persName>Danae</persName>, and to a swan through love of <persName>Leda</persName>, and to a
               man through love of <persName>Antiope</persName>, and to lightning through love of <persName>Luna</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n10"/> and so by
               these he begat many children. For by <persName>Antiope</persName>, they say, that he begat <persName>Zethus</persName> and
               <persName>Amphion</persName>, and by <persName>Luna Dionysos</persName>, by <persName>Alcmena Hercules</persName>, and by <persName>Leto</persName>, <persName>Apollo</persName> and <persName>Artemis</persName>,
               and by <persName>Danae</persName> <persName>Perseus</persName>, and by <persName>Leda</persName>, <persName>Castor</persName> and <persName>Polydeuces</persName>, and <persName>Helene</persName> and <persName>Paludus</persName>,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n11"/>
               and by Mnemosyne he begat nine daughters whom they styled the Muses, and by <placeName>Europe</placeName>,
               <persName>Minos</persName> and <persName>Rhadamanthos</persName> and <persName>Sarpedon</persName>. And lastly he changed himself into the likeness
               of an eagle through his passion for <persName>Ganydemos (Ganymede)</persName> the shepherd.</p>
            <p>By reason of these tales, O King, much evil has arisen among men, who to this day are
               imitators of their gods, and practise adultery and defile themselves with their
               mothers and their sisters, and by lying with males, and some make bold to slay even
               their parents. For if he who is said to be the chief and king of their gods do these
               things how much more should his worshippers imitate him? And great is the folly which
               the Greeks have brought forward in their narrative concerning him. For it is
               impossible that a god should practise adultery or fornication or come near to lie
               with males, or kill his parents; and if it be otherwise, he is much worse than a
               destructive demon.</p>
         </div> 
         <div type="section" n="10">
            <p>Again they bring forward as another god <persName>Hephaistos</persName>. And they say of him, that he is
               lame, and a cap is set on his head, and he holds in his hands firetongs and a hammer;
               and he follows the craft of iron working, that thereby he may procure the necessaries
               of his livelihood. Is then this god so very needy? But it cannot be that a god should
               be needy or lame, else he is very worthless.</p>
            <p>And further they bring in another god and call him <persName>Hermes</persName>. And they say that he is a
               thief,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n12"/> a lover of avarice, and greedy for gain, and a magician and mutilated and
               an athlete, and an interpreter of language. But it is impossible that a god should be
               a magician or avaricious, or maimed, or craving for what is not his, or an athlete.
               And if it be otherwise, he is found to be useless.</p>
            <p>And after him they bring forward as another god <persName>Asklepios</persName>. And they say that he is a
               physician and prepares drugs and plaster that he may supply the necessaries of his
               livelihood. Is then this god in want? And at length he was struck with lightning by
               Dios on account of <persName>Tyndareos</persName> of <placeName>Lacedaemon</placeName>, and so he died. If then <persName>Asklepios</persName> were a
               god, and, when he was struck with lightning, was unable to help himself, how should
               he be able to give help to others? But that a divine nature should be in want or be
               destroyed by lightning is impossible.</p>
            <p>And again they bring forward another as a god, and they call him <persName>Ares</persName>. And they say
               that he is a warrior, and jealous, and covets sheep and things which are not his. And
               he makes gain by his arms. And they say that at length he committed adultery with
               <persName>Aphrodite</persName>, and was caught by the little boy <persName>Eros</persName> and by <persName>Hephaistos</persName> the husband of
               <persName>Aphrodite</persName>. But it is impossible that a god should be a warrior or bound or an
               adulterer.</p>
            <p>And again they say of <persName>Dionysos</persName> that he forsooth! is a god, who arranges carousals by
               night, and teaches drunkenness, and carries off women who do not belong to him. And
               at length, they say, he went mad and dismissed his handmaidens and fled into the
               desert; and during his madness he ate serpents. And at last he was killed by <persName>Titanos</persName>.
               If then <persName>Dionysos</persName> were a god, and when he was being killed was unable to help himself,
               how is it possible that he should help others?</p>
            <p><persName>Herakles</persName> next they bring forward and say that he is a god, who hates detestable
               things, a tyrant,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n13"/> and warrior and a destroyer of plagues. And of him also they
               say that at length he became mad and killed his own children, and cast himself into a
               fire and died. If then <persName>Herakles</persName> is a god, and in all these calamities was unable to
               rescue himself, how should others ask help from him? But it is impossible that a god
               should be mad, or drunken or a slayer of his children, or consumed by fire.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="11">
            <p>And after him they bring forward another god and call him <persName>Apollon</persName>. And they say that
               he is jealous and inconstant, and at times he holds the bow and quiver, and again the
               lyre and plectron. And he utters oracles for men that he may receive rewards from
               them. Is then this god in need of rewards? But it is an insult that all these things
               should be found with a god.</p>
            <p>And after him they bring forward as a goddess <persName>Artemis</persName>, the sister of <persName>Apollo</persName>; and they
               say that she was a huntress and that she herself used to carry a bow and bolts, and
               to roam about upon the mountains, leading the hounds to hunt stags or wild boars of
               the field. But it is disgraceful that a virgin maid should roam alone upon the hills
               or hunt in the chase for animals. Wherefore it is impossible that <persName>Artemis</persName> should be a
               goddess.</p>
            <p>Again they say of <persName>Aphrodite</persName> that she indeed is a goddess. And at times she dwells
               with their gods, but at other times she is a neighbour to men. And once she had Ares
               as a lover, and again <persName>Adonis</persName> who is <persName>Tammuz</persName>. Once also, <persName>Aphrodite</persName> was wailing and
               weeping for the death of <persName>Tammuz</persName>, and they say that she went down to Sheol that she
               might redeem <persName>Adonis</persName> from <persName>Persephone</persName>, who is the daughter of <persName>Sheol (Hades)</persName>. If then
               Aphrodite is a goddess and was unable to help her lover at his death, how will she
               find it possible to help others? And this cannot be listened to, that a divine nature
               should come to weeping and wailing and adultery.</p>
            <p>And again they say of <persName>Tammuz</persName> that he is a god. And he is, forsooth! a hunter and an
               adulterer. And they say that he was killed by a wound from a wild boar, without being
               able to help himself. And if he could not help himself, how can he take thought for
               the human race? But that a god should be an adulterer or a hunter or should die by
               violence is impossible.</p>
            <p>Again they say of <persName>Rhea</persName> that she is the mother of their gods. And they say that she
               had once a lover <persName>Atys</persName>, and that she used to delight in depraved men. And at last she
               raised a lamentation and mourned for <persName>Atys</persName> her lover. If then the mother of their gods
               was unable to help her lover and deliver him from death, how can she help others? So
               it is disgraceful that a goddess should lament and weep and take delight in depraved
               men.</p>
            <p>Again they introduce <persName>Kore</persName> and say that she is a goddess, and she was stolen away by
               Pluto, and could not help herself. If then she is a goddess and was unable to help
               herself how will she find means to help others? For a god who is stolen away is very
               powerless.</p>
            <p>All this, then, O King, have the Greeks brought forward concerning their gods, and
               they have invented and declared it concerning them. And hence all men received an
               impulse to work all profanity and all defilements; and hereby the whole earth was
               corrupted.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="12">
            <p>The <persName>Egyptians</persName>, moreover, because they are more base and stupid than every people that
               is on the earth, have themselves erred more than all. For the deities (or religion)
               of the <persName>Barbarians</persName> and the Greeks did not suffice for them, but they introduced some
               also of the nature of the animals, and said thereof that they were gods, and likewise
               of creeping things which are found on the dry land and in the waters. And of plants
               and herbs they said that some of them were gods. And they were corrupted by every
               kind of delusion and defilement more than every people that is on the earth. For from
               ancient times they worshipped <persName>Isis</persName>, and they say that she is a goddess whose husband
               was <persName>Osiris</persName> her brother. And when <persName>Osiris</persName> was killed by <persName>Typhon</persName> his brother, Isis fled
               with <persName>Horos</persName> her son to <persName>Byblus</persName> in <placeName>Syria</placeName>, and was there for a certain time till her son
               was grown. And he contended with <persName>Typhon</persName> his uncle, and killed him. And then <persName>Isis</persName>
               returned and went about with <persName>Horos</persName> her son and sought for the dead body of <persName>Osiris</persName> her
               lord, bitterly lamenting his death. If then <persName>Isis</persName> be a goddess, and could not help
               <persName>Osiris</persName> her brother and lord, how can she help another? But it is impossible that a
               divine nature should be afraid, and flee for safety, or should weep and wail; or else
               it is very miserable.</p>
            <p>And of <persName>Osiris</persName> also they say that he is a serviceable god. And he was killed by <persName>Typhon</persName>
               and was unable to help himself. But it is well known that this cannot be asserted of
               divinity. And further, they say of his brother <persName>Typhon</persName> that he is a god, who killed
               his brother and was killed by his brother’s son and by his bride, being unable to
               help himself. And how, pray, is he a god who does not save himself ?</p>
            <p>As the <persName>Egyptians</persName>, then, were more stupid than the rest of the nations, these and such
               like gods did not suffice for them. Nay, but they even apply the name of gods to
               animals in which there is no soul at all. For some of them worship the sheep and
               others the calf; and some the pig and others the shad fish; and some the crocodile
               and the hawk and the fish and the ibis and the vulture and the eagle and the raven.
               Some of them worship the cat, and others the turbotfish, some the dog, some the
               adder, and some the asp, and others the lion; and others the garlic and onions and
               thorns, and others the tiger and other such things. And the poor creatures do not see
               that all these things are nothing, although they daily witness their gods being eaten
               and consumed by men and also by their fellows; while some of them are cremated, and
               some die and decay and become dust, without their observing that they perish in many
               ways. So the <persName>Egyptians</persName> have not observed that such things which are not equal to
               their own deliverance, are not gods. And if, forsooth, they are weak in the case of
               their own deliverance, whence have they power to help in the case of deliverance of
               their worshippers? Great then is the error into which the <persName>Egyptians</persName>
               wandered;—greater, indeed, than that of any people which is upon the face of the
               earth.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section" n="13">
            <p>But it is a marvel, O King, with regard to the Greeks, who surpass all other peoples
               in their manner of life and reasoning, how they have gone astray after dead idols and
               lifeless images. And yet they see their gods in the hands of their artificers being
               sawn out, and planed and docked, and hacked short, and charred, and ornamented, and
               being altered by them in every kind of way. And when they grow old, and are worn away
               through lapse of time, and when they are molten and crushed to powder, how, I wonder,
               did they not perceive concerning them, that they are not gods? And as for those who
               did not find deliverance for themselves, how can they serve the distress of men?</p>
            <p>But even the writers and philosophers among them have wrongly alleged that the gods
               are such as are made in honour of God Almighty. And they err in seeking to liken
               (them) to God whom man has not at any time seen nor can see unto what He is like.
               Herein, too (they err) in asserting of deity that any such thing as deficiency can be
               present to it; as when they say that He receives sacrifice and requires
               burnt-offering and libation and immolations of men, and temples. But God is not in
               need, and none of these things is necessary to Him; and it is clear that men err in
               these things they imagine.</p>
            <p>Further their writers and their philosophers represent and declare that the nature of
               all their gods is one. And they have not apprehended God our Lord who while He is
               one, is in all. They err therefore. For if the body of a man while it is many in its
               parts is not in dread, one member of another, but, since it is a united body, wholly
               agrees with itself; even so also God is one in His nature. A single essence is proper
               to Him, since He is uniform in His nature and His essence; and He is not afraid of
               Himself. If then the nature of the gods is one, it is not proper that a god should
               either pursue or slay or harm a god. If, then, gods be pursued and wounded by gods,
               and some be kidnapped and some struck dead by lightning, it is obvious that the
               nature of their gods is not one. And hence it is known, O King, that it is a mistake
               when they reckon and bring the natures of their gods under a single nature. If then
               it becomes us to admire a god which is seen and does not see, how much more
               praiseworthy is it that one should believe in a nature which is invisible and
               all-seeing? And if further it is fitting that one should approve the handiworks of a
               craftsman, how much more is it fitting that one should glorify the Creator of the
               craftsman?</p>
            <p>For behold! when the Greeks made laws they did not perceive that by their laws they
               condemn their gods. For if their laws are righteous, their gods are unrighteous,
               since they transgressed the law in killing one another, and practising sorcery, and
               committing adultery, and in robbing and stealing, and in lying with males, and by
               their other practises as well. For if their gods were right in doing all these things
               as they are described, then the laws of the Greeks are unrighteous in not being made
               according to the will of their gods. And in that case the whole world is gone
               astray.</p>
            <p>For the narratives about their gods are some of them myths, and some of them
               nature-poems (lit: natural:—<foreign>φυσικαί</foreign>), and some of them hymns and elegies. The hymns
               indeed and elegies are empty words and noise. But these nature-poems, even if they be
               made as they say, still those are not gods who do such things and suffer and endure
               such things. And those myths are shallow tales with no depth whatever in them.</p>
         </div> 
         <div type="section" n="14">
            <p>Let us come now, O King, to the history of the Jews also, and see what opinion they
               have as to God. The Jews then say that God is one, the Creator of all, and
               omnipotent; and that it is not right that any other should be worshipped except this
               God alone. And herein they appear to approach the truth more than all the nations,
               especially in that they worship God and not His works. And they imitate God by the
               philanthropy which prevails among them; for they have compassion on the poor, and
               they release the captives, and bury the dead, and do such things as these, which are
               acceptable before God and well-pleasing also to men,—which (customs) they have
               received from their forefathers.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless they too erred from true knowledge. And in their imagination they
               conceive that it is God they serve; whereas by their mode of observance it is to the
               angels and not to God that their service is rendered:—as when they celebrate sabbaths
               and the beginning of the months, and feasts of unleavened bread, and a great fast;
               and fasting and circumcision and the purification of meats, which things, however,
               they do not observe perfectly.</p>
         </div> 
         <div type="section" n="15">
            <p>But the Christians, O King, while they went about and made search,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n14"/> have found the
               truth; and as we learned from their writings, they have come nearer to truth and
               genuine knowledge than the rest of the nations. For they know and trust in God, the
               Creator of heaven and of earth, in whom and from whom are all things, to whom there
               is no other god as companion, from whom they received commandments which they
               engraved upon their minds and observe in hope and expectation of the world which is
               to come. Wherefore they do not commit adultery nor fornication, nor bear false
               witness, nor embezzle what is held in pledge, nor covet what is not theirs. They
               honour father and mother, and show kindness to those near to them; and whenever they
               are judges, they judge uprightly. They do not worship idols (made) in the image of
               man; and whatsoever they would not that others should do unto them, they do not to
               others; and of the food which is consecrated to idols they do not eat, for they are
               pure. And their oppressors they appease (lit: comfort) and make them their friends;
               they do good to their enemies; and their women, O King, are pure as virgins, and
               their daughters are modest; and their men keep themselves from every unlawful union
               and from all uncleanness, in the hope of a recompense to come in the other world.
               Further, if one or other of them have bondmen and bondwomen or children, through love
               towards them they persuade them to become Christians, and when they have done so,
               they call them brethren without distinction. They do not worship strange gods, and
               they go their way in all modesty and cheerfulness. Falsehood is not found among them;
               and they love one another, and from widows they do not turn away their esteem; and
               they deliver the orphan from him who treats him harshly. And he, who has, gives to
               him who has not, without boasting. And when they see a stranger, they take him in to
               their homes and rejoice over him as a very brother; for they do not call them
               brethren after the flesh, but brethren after the spirit and in God. And whenever one
               of their poor passes from the world, each one of them according to his ability gives
               heed to him and carefully sees to his burial. And if they hear that one of their
               number is imprisoned or afflicted on account of the name of their Messiah, all of
               them anxiously minister to his necessity, and if it is possible to redeem him they
               set him free. And if there is among them any that is poor and needy, and if they have
               no spare food, they fast two or three days in order to supply to the needy their lack
               of food. They observe the precepts of their Messiah with much care, living justly and
               soberly as the Lord their God commanded them. Every morning<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n15"/> and every hour they
               give thanks and praise to God for His loving-kindnesses toward them; and for their
               food and their drink they offer thanksgiving to Him. And if any righteous man among
               them passes from the world, they rejoice and offer thanks to God; and they escort his
               body as if he were setting out from one place to another near. And when a child has
               been born to one of them, they give thanks to God; and if moreover it happen to die
               in childhood, they give thanks to God the more, as for one who has passed through the
               world without sins. And further if they see that anyone of them dies in his
               ungodliness or in his sins, for him they grieve bitterly, and sorrow as for one who
               goes to meet his doom.</p>

         <div type="section" n="16">
            <p>Such, O King, is the commandment of the law of the Christians, and such is their
               manner of life. As men who know God, they ask from Him petitions which are fitting
               for Him to grant and for them to receive. And thus they employ their whole lifetime.
               And since they know the loving-kindnesses of God toward them, behold! for their sake
               the glorious things which are in the world flow forth to view. And verily, they are
               those who found the truth when they went about and made search for it; and from what
               we considered, we learned that they alone come near to a knowledge of the truth. And
               they do not proclaim in the ears of the multitude the kind deeds they do, but are
               careful that no one should notice them; and they conceal their giving just as he who
               finds a treasure and conceals it. And they strive to be righteous as those who expect
               to behold their Messiah, and to receive from Him with great glory the promises made
               concerning them. And as for their words and their precepts, O King, and their
               glorying in their worship, and the hope of earning according to the work of each one
               of them their recompense which they look for in another world, you may learn about
               these from their writings. It is enough for us to have shortly informed your Majesty
               concerning the conduct and the truth of the Christians. For great indeed, and
               wonderful is their doctrine to him who will search into it and reflect upon it. And
               verily, this is a new people, and there is something divine (lit: a divine admixture)
               in the midst of them.</p>
            <p>Take, then, their writings, and read therein, and lo! you will find that I have not
               put forth these things on my own authority, nor spoken thus as their advocate; but
               since I read in their writings I was fully assured of these things as also of things
               which are to come. And for this reason I was constrained to declare the truth to such
               as care for it and seek the world to come. And to me there is no doubt but that the
               earth abides through the supplication of the Christians. But the rest of the nations
               err and cause error in wallowing before the elements of the world, since beyond these
               their mental vision will not pass. And they search about as if in darkness because
               they will not recognize the truth; and like drunken men they reel and jostle one
               another and fall.</p>

         <div type="section" n="17">
            <p>Thus far, <persName>O King</persName>, I have spoken; for concerning that which remains, as is said
               above,<ptr type="noteAnchor" target="#n16"/> there are found in their other writings things which are hard to utter and
               difficult for one to narrate,—which are not only spoken in words but also wrought out
               in deeds.</p> 
            <p>Now the Greeks, <persName>O King</persName>, as they follow base practises in intercourse with males, and
               a mother and a sister and a daughter, impute their monstrous impurity in turn to the
               Christians. But the Christians are just and good, and the truth is set before their
               eyes, and their spirit is long-suffering; and, therefore, though they know the error
               of these (the Greeks), and are persecuted by them, they bear and endure it; and for
               the most part they have compassion on them, as men who are destitute of knowledge.
               And on their side, they offer prayer that these may repent of their error; and when
               it happens that one of them has repented, he is ashamed before the Christians of the
               works which were done by him; and he makes confession to God, saying, I did these
               things in ignorance. And he purifies his heart, and his sins are forgiven him,
               because he committed them in ignorance in the former time, when he used to blaspheme
               and speak evil of the true knowledge of the Christians. And assuredly the race of the
               Christians is more blessed than all the men who are upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>Henceforth let the tongues of those who utter vanity and harass the Christians be
               silent; and hereafter let them speak the truth. For it is of serious consequence to
               them that they should worship the true God rather than worship a senseless sound. And
               verily whatever is spoken in the mouth of the Christians is of God; and their
               doctrine is the gateway of light. Wherefore let all who are without the knowledge of
               God draw near thereto; and they will receive incorruptible words, which are from all
               time and from eternity. So shall they appear before the awful judgment which through
               <persName>Jesus the Messiah</persName> is destined to come upon the whole human race.</p>

            <note type="footnote" xml:id="n1">The superscription seems to be duplicate in the

               <persName>Cæsar Hadrian</persName> from <persName>Aristides</persName>.</quote> Various explanations are offered. (a) Both emperors,
               as colleagues, may be meant. In support of this the Syriac adjectives for <quote>venerable
               and merciful</quote> are marked plural; the phrase <quote>Your majesty</quote> occurring later has a
               plural suffix; and two Imperatives, <quote>Take and read,</quote> are plural. On the other hand <quote>O
               King</quote> occurs constantly in the singular; and the emperors were colleagues only for a
               few months in the year a.d. 138. (b) The longer heading is the true one—the shorter
               being due perhaps to a scribe who had a collection of works to copy. In that case the
               word <hi rend="doubleQuote"><persName>Hadrian</persName></hi> has been selected from the full title of Antonine, and the two
               adjectives <quote>venerable and merciful</quote> are proper names, <persName>Augustus Pius. (Harris.)</persName> (c)
               The shorter heading has the support of <persName>Eusebius</persName> and the <persName>Armenian</persName> version; and the
